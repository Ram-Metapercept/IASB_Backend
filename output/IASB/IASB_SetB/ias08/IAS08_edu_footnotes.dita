In the fact pattern described in the request, an entity and a tax authority       dispute whether the entity is required to pay the tax. The tax is not an income tax, so it is       not within the scope of IAS 12. Any liability or contingent liability to pay the tax is       instead within the scope of IAS 37. Taking account of all available evidence, the preparer of       the entity&#x2019;s financial statements judges it probable that the entity will not be required to       pay the tax&#x2014;it is more likely than not that the dispute will be resolved in the entity&#x2019;s       favour. Applying IAS 37, the entity discloses a contingent liability and does not recognise a       liability. To avoid possible penalties, the entity has deposited the disputed amount with the       tax authority. Upon resolution of the dispute, the tax authority will be required to either       refund the tax deposit to the entity (if the dispute is resolved in the entity&#x2019;s favour) or       use the deposit to settle the entity&#x2019;s liability (if the dispute is resolved in the tax       authority&#x2019;s favour).</p>       <p typeface="sansserif" outputclass="keep_with_next">Whether the tax deposit gives rise to an asset, a contingent asset or neither</p>       <p>The Committee observed that if the tax deposit gives rise to an asset, that asset may not         be clearly within the scope of any IFRS Standard. Furthermore, the Committee concluded that         no IFRS Standard deals with issues similar or related to the issue that arises in assessing         whether the right arising from the tax deposit meets the definition of an asset.         Accordingly, applying paragraphs 10&#x2013;11 of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 8</ph>           <ph outputclass="standard_title">Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and             Errors</ph></ph>, the Committee referred to the two definitions of an asset in IFRS         literature&#x2014;the definition in the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting</ph></ph>         issued in March 2018 and the definition in the previous <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> that was in place when many         existing IFRS Standards were developed. The Committee concluded that the right arising from         the tax deposit meets either of those definitions. The tax deposit gives the entity a right         to obtain future economic benefits, either by receiving a cash refund or by using the         payment to settle the tax liability. The nature of the tax deposit&#x2014;whether voluntary or         required&#x2014;does not affect this right and therefore does not affect the conclusion that there         is an asset. The right is not a contingent asset as defined by IAS 37 because it is an         asset, and not a possible asset, of the entity.</p>       <p>Consequently, the Committee concluded that in the fact pattern described in the request the         entity has an asset when it makes the tax deposit to the tax authority.</p>        <p typeface="sansserif" outputclass="keep_with_next">Recognising, measuring, presenting and disclosing the tax deposit</p>       <p>In the absence of a Standard that specifically applies to the asset, an entity applies         paragraphs 10&#x2013;11 of IAS 8 in developing and applying an accounting policy for the asset. The         entity&#x2019;s management uses its judgement in developing and applying a policy that results in         information that is relevant to the economic decision-making needs of users of financial         statements and reliable. The Committee noted that the issues that need to be addressed in         developing and applying an accounting policy for the tax deposit may be similar or related         to those that arise for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of         monetary assets. If this is the case, the entity&#x2019;s management would refer to requirements in         IFRS Standards dealing with those issues for monetary assets.</p>       <p>The Committee concluded that the requirements in IFRS Standards and concepts in the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework for             Financial Reporting</ph></ph> provide an adequate basis for an entity to account for         deposits relating to taxes other than income tax.
