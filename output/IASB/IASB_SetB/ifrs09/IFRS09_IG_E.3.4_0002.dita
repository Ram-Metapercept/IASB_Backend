The issue of recognising changes in the carrying amount of a financial asset or financial liability held by a foreign operation is addressed in a separate question (see Question E.3.3).</p><p base="F32876846" id="IFRS09_P5378">Any exchange difference arising on recognising <i>a monetary item</i> at a rate different from that at which it was initially recognised during the period, or recognised in previous financial statements, is recognised in profit or loss in accordance with <xref base="F43753066" href="../ias21/IAS21_TOC.dita#IAS21_TOC0001" id="IFRS09_X1979">IAS 21</xref> (<xref base="F43753067" href="IFRS09_B5.7.2.dita#IFRS09_B5.7.2" id="IFRS09_X1980">paragraph B5.7.2 of IFRS 9</xref>, <xref base="F43753068" href="../ias21/IAS21_28.dita#IAS21_28" id="IFRS09_X1981">paragraphs 28</xref> and <xref base="F43753069" href="../ias21/IAS21_32.dita#IAS21_32" id="IFRS09_X1982">32 of IAS 21</xref>), unless the monetary item is designated as a cash flow hedge of a highly probable forecast transaction in foreign currency, in which case the requirements for recognition of gains and losses on cash flow hedges apply (<xref base="F43753070" href="IFRS09_g6.5.11-6.5.12.dita#IFRS09_g6.5.11-6.5.12/IFRS09_g6.5.11-6.5.12_TI" id="IFRS09_X1983">paragraph 6.5.11 of IFRS 9</xref> or <xref base="F43753071" href="../ias39/IAS39_g95-101.dita#IAS39_g95-101/IAS39_g95-101_TI" id="IFRS09_X1984">paragraph 95 of IAS 39</xref>). Differences arising from recognising a monetary item at a foreign currency amount different from that at which it was previously recognised are accounted for in a similar manner, since all changes in the carrying amount relating to foreign currency movements should be treated consistently. All other changes in the statement of financial position measurement of a monetary item are recognised in profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9. For example, although an entity recognises gains and losses on financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income in other comprehensive income (<xref base="F43753109" href="IFRS09_g5.7.10-5.7.11.dita#IFRS09_g5.7.10-5.7.11/IFRS09_g5.7.10-5.7.11_TI" id="IFRS09_X1985">paragraphs 5.7.10</xref> and <xref base="F71119420" href="IFRS09_B5.7.2A.dita#IFRS09_B5.7.2A" id="IFRS09_X1986">B5.7.2A of IFRS 9</xref>), the entity nevertheless recognises the changes in the carrying amount relating to changes in foreign exchange rates in profit or loss (<xref base="F43753111" href="../ias21/IAS21_g23-26.dita#IAS21_g23-26/IAS21_g23-26_TI" id="IFRS09_X1987">paragraph 23(a) of IAS 21</xref>).</p><p base="F32876847" id="IFRS09_P5379">Any changes in the carrying amount of a <i>non-monetary item</i> are recognised in profit or loss or in other comprehensive income in accordance with IFRS 9.

If the non-monetary item is designated as a cash flow hedge of an unrecognised firm commitment or a highly probable forecast transaction in foreign currency, the requirements for recognition of gains and losses on cash flow hedges apply (<xref base="F43753114" href="IFRS09_g6.5.11-6.5.12.dita#IFRS09_g6.5.11-6.5.12/IFRS09_g6.5.11-6.5.12_TI" id="IFRS09_X1990">paragraph 6.5.11 of IFRS 9</xref> or <xref base="F43753115" href="../ias39/IAS39_g95-101.dita#IAS39_g95-101/IAS39_g95-101_TI" id="IFRS09_X1991">paragraph 95 of IAS 39</xref>).</p><p base="F32876848" id="IFRS09_P5380">When some portion of the change in carrying amount is recognised in other comprehensive income and some portion is recognised in profit or loss, for example, if the amortised cost of a foreign currency bond measured at fair value through other comprehensive income has increased in foreign currency (resulting in a gain in profit or loss) but its fair value has decreased in foreign currency (resulting in a loss recognised in other comprehensive income), an entity cannot offset those two components for the purposes of determining gains or losses that should be recognised in profit or loss or in other comprehensive income.</p></body></topic>
