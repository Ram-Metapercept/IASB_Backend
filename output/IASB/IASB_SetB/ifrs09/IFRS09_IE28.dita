As a result of the factors described in <xref id="IFRS09_X1730" base="F70814245" href="IFRS09_IE27.dita#IFRS09_IE27">paragraph IE27</xref>, Entity B determines that the bond does not have low credit risk at the reporting date. As a result, Entity B needs to determine whether the increase in credit risk since initial recognition has been significant. On the basis of its assessment, Company B determines that the credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition and that a loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses should be recognised in accordance with <xref id="IFRS09_X1731" base="F70814243" href="IFRS09_5.5.3.dita#IFRS09_5.5.3">paragraph 5.5.3 of IFRS 9</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
