However, the hedge accounting for the first level relationship is affected by the start of hedge accounting for the second level relationship at the end of Period 1. The fair value hedge for the second level relationship affects the timing of the reclassification to profit or loss of amounts from the cash flow hedge reserve for the first level relationship:</p><ol id="IFRS09_L0198" base="SL32829709" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P4133" base="SL32829711">The fair value interest rate risk that is hedged by the fair value hedge is included in the amount that is recognised in other comprehensive income as a result of the cash flow hedge for the first level hedging relationship (ie the gain or loss on the cross&#x2011;currency interest rate swap that is determined to be an effective hedge).<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS09_FN0075" type="fn"/> This means that from the end of Period 1 the part of the effective cash flow hedging gain or loss that represents the fair value interest rate risk (in LC), and is recognised in other comprehensive income in a first step, is in a second step immediately (ie in the same period) transferred from the cash flow hedge reserve to profit or loss. That reclassification adjustment offsets the gain or loss on the interest rate swap that is recognised in profit or loss.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS09_FN0076" type="fn"/> In the context of accounting for the aggregated exposure as the hedged item, that reclassification adjustment is the equivalent of a fair value hedge adjustment because in contrast to a hedged item that is a fixed rate debt instrument (in LC) at amortised cost, the aggregated exposure is already remeasured for changes regarding the hedged risk but the resulting gain or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income because of applying cash flow hedge accounting for the first level relationship. Consequently, applying fair value hedge accounting with the aggregated exposure as the hedged item does not result in changing the hedged item&#x2019;s measurement but instead affects where the hedging gains and losses are recognised (ie reclassification from the cash flow hedge reserve to profit or loss).</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P4134" base="SL32829713">The amount in the cash flow hedge reserve at the end of Period 1 (LC42,310) is amortised over the remaining life of the cash flow hedge for the first level relationship (ie over Periods 2 to 4).<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS09_FN0077" type="fn"/></p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
