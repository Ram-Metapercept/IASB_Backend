Entity C hedges its FC denominated liabilities (including the interest) for their entire life. Consequently, Entity C enters into a cross-currency interest rate swap at the same time as it issues an FC denominated liability. Under the cross-currency interest rate swap Entity C receives variable interest in FC (used to pay the interest on the liability) and pays fixed interest in LC.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P3776" base="SL32829145">Entity C considers the cash flows on a hedged liability and on the related cross-currency interest rate swap as one aggregated fixed rate exposure in LC. From time to time, in accordance with its risk management strategy for fixed rate interest rate risk (in LC), Entity C decides to link its interest payments to current variable interest rate levels and hence swaps its aggregated fixed rate exposure in LC into a variable rate exposure in LC. Consequently, Entity C uses interest rate swaps (denominated entirely in LC) under which it receives fixed interest (used to pay the interest on the pay leg of the cross-currency interest rate swap) and pays variable interest.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
