The only debt in the capital structure is a five-year public bond with a restriction on further borrowing as the only bond covenant. Company A reports quarterly to its shareholders. Entity B is one of many investors in the bond. Entity B considers the bond to have low credit risk at initial recognition in accordance with <xref id="IFRS09_X1728" base="F70814241" href="IFRS09_5.5.10.dita#IFRS09_5.5.10">paragraph 5.5.10 of IFRS 9</xref>. This is because the bond has a low risk of default and Company A is considered to have a strong capacity to meet its obligations in the near term. Entity B&#x2019;s expectations for the longer term are that adverse changes in economic and business conditions may, but will not necessarily, reduce Company A&#x2019;s ability to fulfil its obligations on the bond. In addition, at initial recognition the bond had an internal credit rating that is correlated to a global external credit rating of investment grade.</p></body></paragraph>
