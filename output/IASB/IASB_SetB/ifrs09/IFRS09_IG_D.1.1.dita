The cash is not legally segregated from Entity A&#x2019;s assets. Should Entity A recognise the cash collateral it has received as an asset?</b></p><p base="F32868429" id="IFRS09_P4993">Yes. The ultimate realisation of a financial asset is its conversion into cash and, therefore, no further transformation is required before the economic benefits of the cash transferred by Entity B can be realised by Entity A. Therefore, Entity A recognises the cash as an asset and a payable to Entity B while Entity B derecognises the cash and recognises a receivable from Entity A.</p></body></topic>
