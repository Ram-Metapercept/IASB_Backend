This hedging relationship is designated at the end of Period 1, when Entity C decides to link its interest payments to current variable interest rate levels and hence swaps its aggregated fixed rate exposure in LC into a variable rate exposure in LC, with a term to the end of Period 4. The aggregated exposure that is designated as the hedged item represents, in LC, the change in value that is the effect of changes in the value of the combined cash flows of the two items designated in the cash flow hedge of the cash flow interest rate risk and FX risk (see (a) above), compared to the interest rates at the end of Period 1 (ie the time of designation of the hedging relationship between the aggregated exposure and the interest rate swap).</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
