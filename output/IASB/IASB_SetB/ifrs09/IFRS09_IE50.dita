Entity A determines that 25 per cent of the gross carrying amount will be lost if the loan defaults (ie the LGD is 25 per cent).<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS09_FN0041" type="fn"/> Entity A measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses using the 12-month PD of 0.5 per cent. Implicit in that calculation is the 99.5 per cent probability that there is no default. At the reporting date the loss allowance for the 12 month expected credit losses is CU1,250 (0.5% × 25% × CU1,000,000).</p></body></paragraph>
