There is also some hedge ineffectiveness that results from a difference in the changes in value for the fixed rate FX liability (as represented by the fair value hedge adjustment) and the cross-currency interest rate swap.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P3770" base="SL32827613">For Periods 2 to 4 the risk management strategy results in interest expense that reflects, after taking into account the effect of the interest rate swap entered into at the end of Period 1, fixed interest rates in LC (ie locking in a single blended fixed coupon rate for a three-period term based on the interest rate environment at the end of Period 1). However, Entity B&#x2019;s interest expense is affected by the hedge ineffectiveness that arises on its hedging relationships. In Period 2 the interest expense is slightly higher than the fixed rate payments locked in with the interest rate swap because the variable payments received under the interest rate swap are less than the total of the cash flows resulting from the aggregated exposure.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS09_FN0069" type="fn"/> In Periods 3 and 4 the interest expense is equal to the locked in rate because the variable payments received under the swap are more than the total of the cash flows resulting from the aggregated exposure.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS09_FN0070" type="fn"/></p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
