Its contractual par amount is CU1,000 with an interest rate of 5 per cent payable annually. The effective interest rate is 5 per cent. At the end of the first reporting period (Period 1), Bank A recognises a loss allowance at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses because there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. A loss allowance balance of CU20 is recognised.</p></body></paragraph>
