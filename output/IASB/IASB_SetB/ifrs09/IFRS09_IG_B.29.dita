The contract is with an individual and is not an exchange-traded contract. The contract requires ABC to take physical delivery of the shares and pay the counterparty CU10 million in cash. M&#x2019;s shares trade in an active public market at an average of 100,000 shares a day. Regular way delivery is three days. Is the forward contract regarded as a regular way contract?</b></p><p base="F32868260" id="IFRS09_P4950">No. The contract must be accounted for as a derivative because it is not settled in the way established by regulation or convention in the marketplace concerned.</p></body></topic>
