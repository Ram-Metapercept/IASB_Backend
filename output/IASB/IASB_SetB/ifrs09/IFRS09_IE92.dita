The change in the fair value of the bond in LC, which amounts to LC34,918, is recognised as an adjustment to the carrying amount. The difference between the fair value of the bond and its amortised cost in LC is LC3,402 (LC134,918 &#x2013; LC138,320). However, the change in the cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income during 20X0 as a reduction is LC 4,602 (LC3,402 + LC1,200).</p></body></paragraph>
