The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to unit C and operation XYZ is significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill, but the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to each of units A and B is not. Nevertheless, the recoverable amounts of units A and B are based on some of the same key assumptions, and the aggregate carrying amount of goodwill allocated to those units is significant.</p><p base="SL154092" id="IAS36_P2371" outputclass="keep_with_next"><i>Operation XYZ</i></p><p base="SL154093" id="IAS36_P2372">The recoverable amount of operation XYZ has been determined based on a value in use calculation. That calculation uses cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five&#x2011;year period, and a discount rate of 8.4 per cent. Cash flows beyond that five&#x2011;year period have been extrapolated using a steady 6.3 per cent growth rate. This growth rate does not exceed the long&#x2011;term average growth rate for the market in which XYZ operates. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which XYZ&#x2019;s recoverable amount is based would <i>not</i> cause XYZ&#x2019;s carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.</p><p base="SL154094" id="IAS36_P2373" outputclass="keep_with_next"><i>Unit C</i></p><p base="SL154095" id="IAS36_P2374">The recoverable amount of unit C has also been determined based on a value in use calculation. That calculation uses cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five&#x2011;year period, and a discount rate of 9.2 per cent. C&#x2019;s cash flows beyond the five&#x2011;year period are extrapolated using a steady 12 per cent growth rate. This growth rate exceeds by 4 percentage points the long&#x2011;term average growth rate for the market in which C operates. However, C benefits from the protection of a 10&#x2011;year patent on its primary product, granted in December 20X2. Management believes that a 12 per cent growth rate is reasonable in the light of that patent. Management also believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which C&#x2019;s recoverable amount is based would <i>not</i> cause C&#x2019;s carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.</p><p base="SL154096" outputclass="keep_with_next" id="IAS36_P2375"><i>Units A and B</i></p><p base="SL154097" id="IAS36_P2376">The recoverable amounts of units A and B have been determined on the basis of value in use calculations. Those units produce complementary products, and their recoverable amounts are based on some of the same key assumptions. Both value in use calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a four&#x2011;year period, and a discount rate of 7.9 per cent. Both sets of cash flows beyond the four&#x2011;year period are extrapolated using a steady 5 per cent growth rate. This growth rate does not exceed the long&#x2011;term average growth rate for the market in which A and B operate. Cash flow projections during the budget period for both A and B are also based on the same expected gross margins during the budget period and the same raw materials price inflation during the budget period. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in any of these key assumptions would <i>not</i> cause the aggregate carrying amount of A and B to exceed the aggregate recoverable amount of those units.</p><table base="SL77603" frame="all" orient="port" id="IAS36_TAB0038" pgwide="0"><tgroup cols="4"><colspec align="left" colnum="1" colsep="0" rowsep="0" colname="C1" colwidth="1*"/><colspec align="left" colnum="2" colsep="0" rowsep="0" colname="C2" colwidth="1*"/><colspec align="left" colnum="3" colsep="0" rowsep="0" colname="C3" colwidth="1*"/><colspec align="left" colnum="4" colsep="0" rowsep="0" colname="C4" colwidth="1*"/><tbody><row keep_together="5"><entry colname="C1">               <p typeface="sansserif" id="IAS36_P2377"/>             </entry><entry align="left" colname="C2">               <p typeface="sansserif" id="IAS36_P2378"><i>Operation XYZ</i></p>             </entry><entry align="left" colname="C3">               <p typeface="sansserif" id="IAS36_P2379"><i>Unit C</i></p>             </entry><entry align="left" colname="C4">               <p typeface="sansserif" id="IAS36_P2380"><i>Units A and B <linebreak/>(in aggregate)</i></p>             </entry></row><row><entry align="left" colname="C1">               <p typeface="sansserif" id="IAS36_P2381">Carrying amount of goodwill</p>             </entry><entry align="left" colname="C2" valign="bottom">               <p typeface="sansserif" id="IAS36_P2382">CU1,200</p>             </entry><entry align="left" colname="C3" valign="bottom">               <p typeface="sansserif" id="IAS36_P2383">CU3,000</p>             </entry><entry align="left" colname="C4" valign="bottom">               <p typeface="sansserif" id="IAS36_P2384">CU800</p>             </entry></row><row><entry align="left" colname="C1" rowsep="1">               <p typeface="sansserif" id="IAS36_P2385">Carrying amount of brand name with indefinite useful life</p>             </entry><entry align="left" colname="C2" rowsep="1" valign="bottom">               <p typeface="sansserif" id="IAS36_P2386">&#x2013;</p>             </entry><entry align="left" colname="C3" rowsep="1" valign="bottom">               <p typeface="sansserif" id="IAS36_P2387">CU1,000</p>             </entry><entry align="left" colname="C4" rowsep="1" valign="bottom">               <p typeface="sansserif" id="IAS36_P2388">&#x2013;</p>             </entry></row><row><entry align="left" rowsep="1" namest="C1" nameend="C4">               <p typeface="sansserif" id="IAS36_P2389"><b>Key assumptions used in value in use calculations</b><xref keyref="footnotes/IAS36_FN0027" type="fn"/></p>             </entry></row><row><entry align="left" colname="C1">               <p base="SL154101" id="IAS36_P2390">Key assumption</p>             </entry><entry align="left" colname="C2">               <p base="SL154105" id="IAS36_P2391">Budgeted gross margins</p>             </entry><entry align="left" colname="C3">               <p base="SL154109" id="IAS36_P2392">5-year US government bond rate</p>             </entry><entry align="left" colname="C4">               <p base="SL154113" id="IAS36_P2393">Budgeted gross margins</p>             </entry></row><row><entry align="left" colname="C1">               <p base="SL154117" id="IAS36_P2394">Basis for determining value(s) assigned to key assumption</p>             </entry><entry align="left" colname="C2">               <p base="SL154121" id="IAS36_P2395">Average gross margins achieved in period immediately before the budget period, increased for expected efficiency improvements.</p>             </entry><entry align="left" colname="C3">               <p base="SL154125" id="IAS36_P2396">Yield on 5-year US government bonds at the beginning of the budget period.</p>             </entry><entry align="left" colname="C4">               <p base="SL154129" id="IAS36_P2397">Average gross margins achieved in period immediately before the budget period, increased for expected efficiency improvements.</p>             </entry></row><row><entry align="left" colname="C1">               <p typeface="sansserif" id="IAS36_P2398"/>             </entry><entry align="left" colname="C2">               <p base="SL154133" id="IAS36_P2399">Values assigned to key assumption reflect past experience, except for efficiency improvements.
