Each plant is located in a different continent. A produces a component that is assembled in either B or C. The combined capacity of B and C is not fully utilised. M&#x2019;s products are sold worldwide from either B or C. For example, B&#x2019;s production can be sold in C&#x2019;s continent if the products can be delivered faster from B than from C. Utilisation levels of B and C depend on the allocation of sales between the two sites.</p><p id="IAS36_P0654" base="SL153950">For each of the following cases, what are the cash&#x2011;generating units for A, B and C?</p><p id="IAS36_P0655" base="SL153951">Case 1: There is an active market for A&#x2019;s products.</p><p id="IAS36_P0656" base="SL153952">Case 2: There is no active market for A&#x2019;s products.</p></body></paragraph>
