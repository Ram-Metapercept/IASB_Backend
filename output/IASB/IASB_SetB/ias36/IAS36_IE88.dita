The growth rates for A, B and XYZ are estimated by M to be consistent with publicly available information about the long&#x2011;term average growth rates for the markets in which A, B and XYZ operate. However, the growth rate for C exceeds the long&#x2011;term average growth rate for the market in which C operates. M&#x2019;s management is of the opinion that this is reasonable in the light of the protection of the 10&#x2011;year patent on C&#x2019;s primary product.</p></body></paragraph>
