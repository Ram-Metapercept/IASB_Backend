In accordance with <xref id="IAS36_X0504" base="F16146139" href="IAS36_C6.dita#IAS36_C6">paragraph C6 of Appendix C of IAS 36</xref>, if the partially&#x2011;owned subsidiary is itself a cash&#x2011;generating unit, the goodwill impairment loss is allocated to the controlling and non&#x2011;controlling interests on the same basis as that on which profit or loss is allocated. In this example, profit or loss is allocated on the basis of relative ownership interests. Because the goodwill is recognised only to the extent of Parent&#x2019;s 80 per cent ownership interest in Subsidiary, Parent recognises only 80 per cent of that goodwill impairment loss (ie CU400).</p></body></paragraph>
