Based on historical prepayment experience, Entity A estimates that, as a consequence, prepayments will occur faster than previously estimated. As a result it re&#x2011;estimates the amount of assets scheduled into this time period (excluding new assets originated during the month) as CU96 million.</p></body></paragraph>
