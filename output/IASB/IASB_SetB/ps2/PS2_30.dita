The process illustrates one possible way to make materiality judgements, but it incorporates the materiality requirements an entity must apply to state compliance with IFRS Standards.  The materiality process considers potential omission and potential misstatement of information, as well as unnecessary inclusion of immaterial information and whether immaterial information obscures material information. In all cases, the entity needs to focus on how the information could reasonably be expected to influence decisions of the primary users of its financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
