Users generally find information about the characteristics of an             entity&#x2019;s transactions, other events or conditions&#x2014;entity-specific information&#x2014;more             useful than disclosures that only include standardised information, or information that             duplicates or summarises the requirements of the IFRS Standards. Entity-specific             accounting policy information is particularly useful when that information relates to an             area for which an entity has exercised judgement&#x2014;for example, when an entity applies an             IFRS Standard differently from similar entities in the same industry.</p></body></paragraph>
