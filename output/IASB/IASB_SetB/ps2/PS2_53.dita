If an entity identifies an item of information as material solely on the basis of the size of the impact of the transaction, other event or condition, the entity does not need to assess that item of information further against other materiality factors. In these circumstances, a quantitative threshold&#x2014;a specified level, rate or amount of one of the measures used in assessing size&#x2014;can be a helpful tool in making a materiality judgement. However, a quantitative assessment alone is not always sufficient to conclude that an item of information is not material. The entity should further assess the presence of qualitative factors.</p></body></paragraph>
