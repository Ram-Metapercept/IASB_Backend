A long-term loan was granted to                 the entity in the current reporting period. The loan agreement includes a clause                 that requires the entity to maintain a ratio of debt to equity below a specified                 threshold, to be measured at each reporting date (the covenant). According to the                 loan agreement, the debt-to-equity ratio has to be calculated on the basis of debt                 and equity figures as presented in the entity&#x2019;s IFRS financial statements. If                 the entity breaches the covenant, the entire loan becomes payable on demand. The                 disclosure of covenant terms in an entity&#x2019;s financial statements is not                 required by any local laws or regulations.</p></entry></row><row><entry colname="C1">               <p id="PS2_P0316" base="F60792882"><b>Application</b></p>               <p id="PS2_P0317" base="F60792899"><xref id="PS2_X0149" base="F62013243" href="../ifrs07/IFRS07_g31-42.dita#IFRS07_g31-42/IFRS07_g31-42_TI">Paragraph 31 of                     <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRSÂ 7</ph>                     <ph outputclass="standard_title">Financial Instruments:                   Disclosures</ph></ph></xref> requires an entity to disclose information that                 enables users of its financial statements to evaluate the nature and extent of risk                 arising from financial instruments to which the entity is exposed at the end of the                 reporting period.</p></entry></row><row><entry colname="C1">               <p id="PS2_P0318" base="F60792900">In the preparation of its financial statements, the                 entity assesses whether information about the existence of the covenant and its                 terms is material information, considering both the consequences  and the likelihood of a                 breach occurring. </p></entry></row><row><entry colname="C1">               <p id="PS2_P0319" base="F60792901">In these circumstances, the entity concluded that,                 considering its recent liquidity problem, any acceleration of the long-term loan                 repayment plan (the consequence of the covenant breach occurring) would affect the                 entity&#x2019;s financial position and cash flows in a way that could reasonably be                 expected to influence primary users&#x2019; decisions.</p></entry></row><row><entry colname="C1">               <p id="PS2_P0320" base="F60792905">The entity also considered the likelihood of a                 breach occurring.</p></entry></row><row><entry colname="C1">               <p id="PS2_P0321" base="F61090581"><b>Scenario 1&#x2014;the lender defined the                   covenant threshold on the basis of the three-year business plan prepared by the                   entity, adding a 10 per cent tolerance to the forecast figures</b></p>               <p id="PS2_P0322" base="F60792911">In this scenario, even though the entity has                 historically met its past business plans, it assessed the likelihood of a breach                 occurring as higher than remote.
