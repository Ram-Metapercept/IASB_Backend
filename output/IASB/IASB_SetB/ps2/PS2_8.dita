An entity makes materiality judgements when making decisions about recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure. Requirements in IFRS Standards only need to be applied if their effect is material to the complete set of financial statements,<xref keyref="footnotes/PS2_FN0009" type="fn"/> which includes the primary financial statements<xref keyref="footnotes/PS2_FN0010" type="fn"/> and the notes. However, it is inappropriate for the entity to make, or leave uncorrected, immaterial departures from IFRS Standards to achieve a particular presentation of its financial position, financial performance or cash flows.<xref keyref="footnotes/PS2_FN0011" type="fn"/></p></body></paragraph>
