At the acquisition date the acquirer expected to continue producing the line, and an analysis of various economic factors indicated there was no limit to the period the trademark would contribute to net cash inflows.              Consequently, the trademark was not amortised by the acquirer.              However, management has recently decided that production of the product line will be discontinued over the next four years.            </p><p id="IAS38_P0416" base="SL142099">Because the useful life of the acquired trademark is no longer regarded as indefinite, the carrying amount of the trademark would be tested for impairment in accordance with <xref id="IAS38_X0497" base="F16456480" href="../ias36/IAS36_TOC0001.dita#IAS36_TOC0001">IASÂ 36</xref>              and amortised over its remaining four&#x2011;year useful life.            </p></body></topic>
