Consequently, in accordance with paragraph 20, Company E recognises, and therefore measures, in relation to its interest in Joint Operation D, only its share in each of the assets that are jointly held and in each of the liabilities that are incurred jointly, as stated in the contractual arrangement. Company E does not include in its assets and liabilities the shares of the other parties in Joint Operation D.</p></body></paragraph>
