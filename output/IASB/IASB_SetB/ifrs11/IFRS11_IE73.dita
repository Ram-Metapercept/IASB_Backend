This means that Company C will continue to recognise the know-how based on its carrying amount of CU300. As a consequence of retaining control of the right to use the know-how that it granted to the joint operation, Company C has granted the right to use the know-how to itself. Consequently, Company C does not remeasure the know-how, and it does not recognise a gain or loss on the grant of the right to use it.</p></body></paragraph>
