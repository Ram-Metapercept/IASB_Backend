Subsequently, the carrying amount of the loan is increased by amortisation of the transaction costs to accounting profit.  The transaction costs were deducted for tax purposes in the period when the loan was first recognised. <i>(notes: (1) the taxable temporary difference is the amount of transaction costs already deducted in determining the taxable profit of current or prior periods, less the cumulative amount amortised to accounting profit; and (2) as the initial recognition of the loan affects taxable profit, the exception in <xref id="IAS12_X0451" base="F1247103" href="IAS12_g15-45.dita#IAS12_g15-45/IAS12_g15-45_TI">paragraph 15(b)</xref> of the Standard does not apply. Therefore, the borrower recognises the deferred tax liability.)</i></p></body></paragraph>
