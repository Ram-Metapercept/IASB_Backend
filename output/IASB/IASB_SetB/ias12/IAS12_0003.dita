Tax law specifies that gains (losses) on the debt instruments are taxable (deductible) only when realised.</p><p id="IAS12_P2304" base="F46911247">Tax law distinguishes ordinary gains and losses from capital gains and losses. Ordinary losses can be offset against both ordinary gains and capital gains. Capital losses can only be offset against capital gains. Capital losses can be carried forward for 5 years and ordinary losses can be carried forward for 20 years.</p><p id="IAS12_P2305" base="F46911248">Ordinary gains are taxed at 30 per cent and capital gains are taxed at 10 per cent.</p><p id="IAS12_P2306" base="F46911249">Tax law classifies interest income from the debt instruments as &#x2018;ordinary&#x2019; and gains and losses arising on the sale of the debt instruments as &#x2018;capital&#x2019;. Losses that arise if the issuer of the debt instrument fails to pay the principal on maturity are classified as ordinary by tax law.</p></body></topic>
