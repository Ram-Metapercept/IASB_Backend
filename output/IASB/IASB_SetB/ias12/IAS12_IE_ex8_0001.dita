The annual lease payments are CU100 payable at the end of each year. Before the commencement date of the lease, Lessee makes a lease payment of CU15 (advance lease payment) and pays initial direct costs of CU5. The interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined. Lessee&#x2019;s incremental borrowing rate is 5% per year.</p><p>At the commencement date, applying <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 16</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Leases</ph></ph>, Lessee recognises a lease liability of CU435 (measured at the present value of the five lease payments of CU100, discounted at the interest rate of 5% per year). Lessee measures the right-of-use asset (lease asset) at CU455, comprising the initial measurement of the lease liability (CU435), the advance lease payment (CU15) and the initial direct costs (CU5).</p></body></topic>
