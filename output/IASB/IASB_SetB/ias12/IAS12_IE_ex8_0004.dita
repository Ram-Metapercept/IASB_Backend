The tax base of the related component of the lease asset&#x2019;s cost is also nil because Lessee will receive no tax deductions from recovering the carrying amount of that component of the lease asset&#x2019;s cost (CU435).</p><p>The differences between the carrying amounts of the lease liability and the related component of the lease asset&#x2019;s cost (CU435) and their tax bases of nil result in the following temporary differences at the commencement date:</p><ol type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value><p>a taxable temporary difference of CU435 associated with the lease asset; and</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value><p>a deductible temporary difference of CU435 associated with the lease liability.</p></li></ol><p>The exemption from recognising a deferred tax asset and liability in paragraphs 15 and 24 does not apply because the transaction gives rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. Lessee concludes that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised. Accordingly, Lessee recognises a deferred tax asset and a deferred tax liability, each of CU87 (CU435 Ã— 20%), for the deductible and taxable temporary differences.</p></body></topic>
