The value of a similar bond without a call or equity conversion option is CU57. Based on an option pricing model, it is determined that the value to the entity of the embedded call feature in a similar bond without an equity conversion option is CU2. In this case, the value allocated to the liability component under paragraph 31 is CU55 (CU57 &#x2013; CU2) and the value allocated to the equity component is CU5 (CU60 &#x2013; CU55).</p></body></paragraph>
