Costs incurred before the recognition criteria for an intangible asset are met are recognised as an expense. Costs incurred after the specific point in time at which the criteria are met are recognised as part of the cost of an intangible asset. &#x2018;Deferring&#x2019; costs as assets in an interim statement of financial position in the hope that the recognition criteria will be met later in the financial year is not justified.</p></body></paragraph>
