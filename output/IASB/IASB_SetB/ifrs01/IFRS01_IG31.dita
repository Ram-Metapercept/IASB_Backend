This may be relevant not only when a subsidiary&#x2019;s reporting package complies fully with the recognition and measurement requirements of IFRSs, but also when it is adjusted centrally for matters such as review of events after the reporting period and central allocation of pension costs. For the disclosure required by <xref id="IFRS01_X1221" base="F15828428" href="IFRS01_26.dita#IFRS01_26">paragraph 26</xref> of the IFRS, adjustments made centrally to an unpublished reporting package are not corrections of errors. However, <xref id="IFRS01_X1222" base="F15828181" href="IFRS01_D16.dita#IFRS01_D16">paragraph D16</xref> does not permit a subsidiary to ignore misstatements that are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements of its parent but material to its own financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
