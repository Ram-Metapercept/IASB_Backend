The opening IFRS statement of financial position reflects those adjustments for the difference in accounting policies.

Therefore, entity A develops estimates in accordance with IAS 37. Under IAS 37, an entity determines whether an obligation exists at the end of the reporting period by taking account of all available evidence, including any additional evidence provided by events after the reporting period.

In this instance, the resolution of the court case confirms that entity A had a liability in September 20X4 (when the events occurred that gave rise to the court case). Therefore, entity A recognises a provision at 31 December 20X4. Entity A measures that provision by discounting the CU1,000 paid on 10 July 20X5 to its present value, using a discount rate that complies with IAS 37 and reflects market conditions at 31 December 20X4.                                </p>                            </entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></body></paragraph>
