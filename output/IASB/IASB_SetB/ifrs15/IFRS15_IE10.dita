The entity has not previously provided medical services to this patient but is required by law to provide medical services to all emergency room patients. Because of the patient&#x2019;s condition upon arrival at the hospital, the entity provides the services immediately and, therefore, before the entity can determine whether the patient is committed to perform its obligations under the contract in exchange for the medical services provided. Consequently, the contract does not meet the criteria in <xref id="IFRS15_X1130" base="F33216570" href="IFRS15_9.dita#IFRS15_9">paragraph 9 of IFRS 15</xref> and, in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X1131" base="F33216571" href="IFRS15_14.dita#IFRS15_14">paragraph 14 of IFRS 15</xref>, the entity will continue to assess its conclusion based on updated facts and circumstances.</p></body></paragraph>
