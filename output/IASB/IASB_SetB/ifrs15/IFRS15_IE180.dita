The entity concludes that the criteria in paragraph 85 of IFRS 15 are met for the following reasons:</p><ol id="IFRS15_L0121" base="F31820366" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P1368" base="F31820367">the variable payment relates specifically to an outcome from the performance obligation to transfer Licence Y (ie the customer&#x2019;s subsequent sales of products that use Licence Y).</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P1369" base="F31820369">allocating the expected royalty amounts of CU1,000 entirely to Licence Y is consistent with the allocation objective in <xref id="IFRS15_X1362" base="F33217839" href="IFRS15_73.dita#IFRS15_73">paragraph 73 of IFRS 15</xref>. This is because the entity&#x2019;s estimate of the amount of sales-based royalties (CU1,000) approximates the stand-alone selling price of Licence Y and the fixed amount of CU800 approximates the stand-alone selling price of Licence X. The entity allocates CU800 to Licence X in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X1363" base="F33217838" href="IFRS15_86.dita#IFRS15_86">paragraph 86 of IFRS 15</xref>. This is because, based on an assessment of the facts and circumstances relating to both licences, allocating to Licence Y some of the fixed consideration in addition to all of the variable consideration would not meet the allocation objective in paragraph 73 of IFRS 15.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
