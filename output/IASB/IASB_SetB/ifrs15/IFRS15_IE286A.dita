The entity concludes that the licence and the manufacturing service are not inputs to a combined item in this contract on the basis of the principle and the factors in <xref id="IFRS15_X1497" base="F51966835" href="IFRS15_29.dita#IFRS15_29/IFRS15_29_V2">paragraph 29 of IFRS 15</xref>. In reaching this conclusion, the entity considers that the customer could separately purchase the licence without significantly affecting its ability to benefit from the licence. Neither the licence, nor the manufacturing service, is significantly modified or customised by the other and the entity is not providing a significant service of integrating those items into a combined output. The entity further considers that the licence and the manufacturing service are not highly interdependent or highly interrelated because the entity would be able to fulfil its promise to transfer the licence independently of fulfilling its promise to subsequently manufacture the drug for the customer. Similarly, the entity would be able to manufacture the drug for the customer even if the customer had previously obtained the licence and initially utilised a different manufacturer. Thus, although the manufacturing service necessarily depends on the licence in this contract (ie the entity would not provide the manufacturing service without the customer having obtained the licence), the licence and the manufacturing service do not significantly affect each other. Consequently, the entity concludes that its promises to grant the licence and to provide the manufacturing service are distinct and that there are two performance obligations: </p> <ol id="IFRS15_L0138" base="F48709501" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P1951" base="F48709502">licence of patent rights; and</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P1952" base="F48709504">manufacturing service.</p></li></ol></variant></body></paragraph>
