However, because the entity regularly sells Products B and C together for CU60 and Product A for CU40, it has evidence that the entire discount should be allocated to the promises to transfer Products B and C in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X1348" base="F33217723" href="IFRS15_82.dita#IFRS15_82">paragraph 82 of IFRS 15</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
