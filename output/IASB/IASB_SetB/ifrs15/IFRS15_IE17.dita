However, the entity learns that the customer has lost access to credit and its major customers and thus the customer&#x2019;s ability to pay significantly deteriorates. The entity therefore concludes that it is unlikely that the customer will be able to make any further royalty payments for ongoing usage of the entity&#x2019;s patent. As a result of this significant change in facts and circumstances, in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X1138" base="F33216612" href="IFRS15_13.dita#IFRS15_13">paragraph 13 of IFRS 15</xref>, the entity reassesses the criteria in <xref id="IFRS15_X1139" base="F33216614" href="IFRS15_9.dita#IFRS15_9">paragraph 9 of IFRS 15</xref> and determines that they are not met because it is no longer probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which it will be entitled. Accordingly, the entity does not recognise any further revenue associated with the customer&#x2019;s future usage of its patent. The entity accounts for any impairment of the existing receivable in accordance with IFRS 9 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Financial Instruments</ph></ph>.</p></body></paragraph>
