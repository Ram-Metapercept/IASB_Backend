The entity determines that the asset (unit) created by the entity&#x2019;s performance does not have an alternative use to the entity because the contract precludes the entity from transferring the specified unit to another customer. The entity does not consider the possibility of a contract termination in assessing whether the entity is able to direct the asset to another customer.</p></body></paragraph>
