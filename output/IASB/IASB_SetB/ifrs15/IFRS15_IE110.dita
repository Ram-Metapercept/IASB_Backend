Each contract includes the sale of one product for CU100 (100 total products × CU100 = CU10,000 total consideration). Cash is received when control of a product transfers. The entity&#x2019;s customary business practice is to allow a customer to return any unused product within 30 days and receive a full refund. The entity&#x2019;s cost of each product is CU60.</p></body></paragraph>
