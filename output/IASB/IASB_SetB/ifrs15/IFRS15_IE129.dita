The entity receives a two per cent quarterly management fee based on the client&#x2019;s assets under management at the end of each quarter. In addition, the entity receives a performance-based incentive fee of 20 per cent of the fund&#x2019;s return in excess of the return of an observable market index over the five-year period. Consequently, both the management fee and the performance fee in the contract are variable consideration.</p></body></paragraph>
