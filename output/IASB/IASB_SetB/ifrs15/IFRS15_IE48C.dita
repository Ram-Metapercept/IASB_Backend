<paragraph id="IFRS15_IE48C" base="F48709225"><paranum>IE48C</paranum><prolog><data name="standard_number" value="IFRS 15"/><data name="paranum" value="IE48C"/></prolog><body><p id="IFRS15_P0983">The entity observes that the nature of its promise is to establish and provide a service of producing the full complement of devices for which the customer has contracted in accordance with the customer&#x2019;s specifications. The entity considers that it is responsible for overall management of the contract and for providing a significant service of integrating various goods and services (the inputs) into its overall service and the resulting devices (the combined output) and, therefore, the devices and the various promised goods and services inherent in producing those devices are not separately identifiable in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X1185" base="F51966659" href="IFRS15_27.dita#IFRS15_27/IFRS15_27_V2">paragraph 27(b)</xref> and <xref id="IFRS15_X1186" base="F51966657" href="IFRS15_29.dita#IFRS15_29/IFRS15_29_V2">paragraph 29 of IFRS 15</xref>. In this case, the manufacturing process provided by the entity is specific to its contract with the customer. In addition, the nature of the entity&#x2019;s performance and, in particular, the significant integration service of the various activities means that a change in one of the entity&#x2019;s activities to produce the devices has a significant effect on the other activities required to produce the highly complex, specialised devices such that the entity&#x2019;s activities are highly interdependent and highly interrelated. Because the criterion in paragraph 27(b) of IFRS 15 is not met, the goods and services that will be provided by the entity are not separately identifiable and, therefore, are not distinct. The entity accounts for all of the goods and services promised in the contract as a single performance obligation.</p></body></paragraph>
