Although the costs for these two employees are incurred as part of providing the service to the customer, the entity concludes that the costs do not generate or enhance resources of the entity (see <xref id="IFRS15_X1380" base="F33217918" href="IFRS15_95.dita#IFRS15_95">paragraph 95(b) of IFRS 15</xref>). Therefore, the costs do not meet the criteria in paragraph 95 of IFRS 15 and cannot be recognised as an asset using IFRS 15. In accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X1381" base="F33217919" href="IFRS15_98.dita#IFRS15_98">paragraph 98</xref>, the entity recognises the payroll expense for these two employees when incurred.</p></body></paragraph>
