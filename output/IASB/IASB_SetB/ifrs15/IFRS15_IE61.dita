The promise of maintenance services is a promise to transfer goods or services in the future and is part of the negotiated exchange between the entity and the distributor. The entity assesses whether each good or service is distinct in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X1219" base="F51966711" href="IFRS15_27.dita#IFRS15_27/IFRS15_27_V2">paragraph 27 of IFRS 15</xref>. The entity determines that both the product and the maintenance services meet the criterion in paragraph 27(a) of IFRS 15. The entity regularly sells the product on a stand&#x2011;alone basis, which indicates that the customer can benefit from the product on its own. The customer can benefit from the maintenance services together with a resource the customer already has obtained from the entity (ie the product).</p></variant></body></paragraph>
