Consequently, in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X1369" base="F33217875" href="IFRS15_B63.dita#IFRS15_B63">paragraph B63 of IFRS 15</xref>, the entity recognises as revenue the CU111 (CU1,000 &#x00F7; CU1,800 × CU200) allocated to Licence Y (which has been transferred to the customer and is therefore a satisfied performance obligation). The entity recognises a contract liability for the CU89 (CU800 &#x00F7; CU1,800 × CU200) allocated to Licence X. This is because although the subsequent sale by the entity&#x2019;s customer has occurred, the performance obligation to which the royalty has been allocated has not been satisfied.</p></body></paragraph>
