The entity recognises revenue from the sales&#x2011;based royalty, the only consideration to which the entity is entitled under the contract, wholly in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X1530" base="F49800518" href="IFRS15_B63.dita#IFRS15_B63">paragraph B63</xref>. If the licence, the memorabilia and the advertising activities are separate performance obligations, the entity would allocate the sales&#x2011;based royalty to each performance obligation.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
