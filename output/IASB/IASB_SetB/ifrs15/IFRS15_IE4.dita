The financing arrangement is provided on a non-recourse basis, which means that if the customer defaults, the entity can repossess the building, but cannot seek further compensation from the customer, even if the collateral does not cover the full value of the amount owed. The entity&#x2019;s cost of the building is CU600,000. The customer obtains control of the building at contract inception.</p></body></paragraph>
