In applying the criteria, the entity concludes that even though the variable payments relate specifically to an outcome from the performance obligation to transfer Licence Y (ie the customer&#x2019;s subsequent sales of products that use Licence Y), allocating the variable consideration entirely to Licence Y would be inconsistent with the principle for allocating the transaction price. Allocating CU300 to Licence X and CU1,500 to Licence Y does not reflect a reasonable allocation of the transaction price on the basis of the stand-alone selling prices of Licences X and Y of CU800 and CU1,000, respectively. Consequently, the entity applies the general allocation requirements in <xref id="IFRS15_X1367" base="F33217873" href="IFRS15_76.dita#IFRS15_76">paragraphs 76&#x2013;80 of IFRS 15</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
