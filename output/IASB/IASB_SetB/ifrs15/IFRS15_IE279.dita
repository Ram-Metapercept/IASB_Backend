The entity determines that the customer can benefit from (a) the licence on its own without the updates; and (b) the updates together with the initial licence. Although the benefit the customer can derive from the licence on its own (ie without the updates) is limited because the updates are integral to the customer&#x2019;s ability to continue to use the intellectual property in an industry in which technologies change rapidly, the licence can be used in a way that generates some economic benefits. Therefore, the criterion in paragraph 27(a) of IFRS 15 is met for the licence and the updates.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
