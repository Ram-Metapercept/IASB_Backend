The entity concludes that the criterion in paragraph 27(a) of IFRS 15 is met because the customer can benefit from the licence together with readily available resources other than the entity&#x2019;s manufacturing service (because there are other entities that can provide the manufacturing service), and can benefit from the manufacturing service together with the licence transferred to the customer at the start of the contract.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
