<paragraph id="IFRS15_IE58I" base="F48709286"><paranum>IE58I</paranum><prolog><data name="standard_number" value="IFRS 15"/><data name="paranum" value="IE58I"/></prolog><body><p id="IFRS15_P1025">The entity determines that its promises to transfer the equipment and to provide consumables over a three&#x2011;year period are each separately identifiable in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X1216" base="F51966709" href="IFRS15_27.dita#IFRS15_27/IFRS15_27_V2">paragraph 27(b) of IFRS 15</xref>. In determining that the equipment and the consumables are not inputs to a combined item in this contract, the entity considers that it is not providing a significant integration service that transforms the equipment and consumables into a combined output. In addition, neither the equipment nor the consumables are significantly customised or modified by the other. Lastly, the entity concludes that the equipment and the consumables are not highly interdependent or highly interrelated because they do not significantly affect each other. Although the customer can benefit from the consumables in this contract only after it has obtained control of the equipment (ie the consumables would have no use without the equipment) and the consumables are required for the equipment to function, the equipment and the consumables do not each significantly affect the other. This is because the entity would be able to fulfil each of its promises in the contract independently of the other. That is, the entity would be able to fulfil its promise to transfer the equipment even if the customer did not purchase any consumables and would be able to fulfil its promise to provide the consumables, even if the customer acquired the equipment separately.</p></body></paragraph>
