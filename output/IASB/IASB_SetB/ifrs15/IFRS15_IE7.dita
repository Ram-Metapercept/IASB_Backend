This is the entity&#x2019;s first sale to a customer in a new region, which is experiencing significant economic difficulty. Thus, the entity expects that it will not be able to collect from the customer the full amount of the promised consideration. Despite the possibility of not collecting the full amount, the entity expects the region&#x2019;s economy to recover over the next two to three years and determines that a relationship with the customer could help it to forge relationships with other potential customers in the region.</p></body></paragraph>
