The entity assesses the indicators in <xref id="IFRS15_X1551" base="F33218893" href="IFRS15_38.dita#IFRS15_38">paragraph 38 of IFRS 15</xref> to determine the point in time at which control of the spare parts transfers to the customer, noting that the entity has received payment, the customer has legal title to the spare parts and the customer has inspected and accepted the spare parts. In addition, the entity concludes that all of the criteria in <xref id="IFRS15_X1552" base="F33218894" href="IFRS15_B81.dita#IFRS15_B81">paragraph B81 of IFRS 15</xref> are met, which is necessary for the entity to recognise revenue in a bill-and-hold arrangement. The entity recognises revenue for the spare parts on 31 December 20X9 when control transfers to the customer.</p></body></paragraph>
