The entity would account for each contract separately. However, depending on the nature of the construction, the entity&#x2019;s performance in undertaking the initial construction works (ie the foundation and the basic structure), as well as the construction of common areas, may need to be reflected when measuring its progress towards complete satisfaction of its performance obligations in each contract.</p></body></paragraph>
