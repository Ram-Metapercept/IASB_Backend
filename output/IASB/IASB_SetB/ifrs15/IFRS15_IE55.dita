The entity first assesses whether the criterion in <xref id="IFRS15_X1200" base="F52069742" href="IFRS15_27.dita#IFRS15_27/IFRS15_27_V2">paragraph 27(a)</xref> has been met. For the same reasons as in Case A, the entity determines that the software licence, installation, software updates and technical support each meet that criterion. The entity next assesses whether the criterion in <xref id="IFRS15_X1201" base="F52069743" href="IFRS15_27.dita#IFRS15_27/IFRS15_27_V2">paragraph 27(b)</xref> has been met by evaluating the principle and the factors in <xref id="IFRS15_X1202" base="F51966660" href="IFRS15_29.dita#IFRS15_29/IFRS15_29_V2">paragraph 29 of IFRS 15</xref>. The entity observes that the terms of the contract result in a promise to provide a significant service of integrating the licenced software into the existing software system by performing a customised installation service as specified in the contract. In other words, the entity is using the licence and the customised installation service as inputs to produce the combined output (ie a functional and integrated software system) specified in the contract (see <xref id="IFRS15_X1203" base="F52069746" href="IFRS15_29.dita#IFRS15_29/IFRS15_29_V2">paragraph 29(a) of IFRS 15</xref>). The software is significantly modified and customised by the service (see <xref id="IFRS15_X1204" base="F52069747" href="IFRS15_29.dita#IFRS15_29/IFRS15_29_V2">paragraph 29(b) of IFRS 15</xref>). Consequently, the entity determines that the promise to transfer the licence is not separately identifiable from the customised installation service and, therefore, the criterion in paragraph 27(b) of IFRS 15 is not met. Thus, the software licence and the customised installation service are not distinct.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
