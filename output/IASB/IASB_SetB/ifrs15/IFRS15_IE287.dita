The drug is a mature product (ie it has been approved, is currently being manufactured and has been sold commercially for the last several years). For these types of mature products, the entity&#x2019;s customary business practices are not to undertake any activities to support the drug. The drug compound has significant stand&#x2011;alone functionality (ie its ability to produce a drug that treats a disease or condition). Consequently, the customer obtains a substantial portion of the benefits of the drug compound from that functionality, rather than from the entity&#x2019;s ongoing activities. The entity concludes that the criteria in paragraph B58 of IFRS 15 are not met because the contract does not require, and the customer does not reasonably expect, the entity to undertake activities that significantly affect the intellectual property to which the customer has rights. In its assessment of the criteria in paragraph B58 of IFRS 15, the entity does not take into consideration the separate performance obligation of promising to provide a manufacturing service. Consequently, the nature of the entity&#x2019;s promise in transferring the licence is to provide a right to use the entity&#x2019;s intellectual property in the form and the functionality with which it exists at the point in time that it is granted to the customer. Consequently, the entity accounts for the licence as a performance obligation satisfied at a point in time.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
