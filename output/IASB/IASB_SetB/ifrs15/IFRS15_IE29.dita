This is because the remaining Products Y and Z are distinct from Product X, which had transferred to the customer before the modification, and the promised consideration for the additional Product Z does not represent its stand-alone selling price. Consequently, in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X1156" base="F33216765" href="IFRS15_21.dita#IFRS15_21">paragraph 21(a) of IFRS 15</xref>, the consideration to be allocated to the remaining performance obligations comprises the consideration that had been allocated to the performance obligation for Product Y (which is measured at an allocated transaction price amount of CU600) and the consideration promised in the modification (fixed consideration of CU300). The transaction price for the modified contract is CU900 and that amount is allocated equally to the performance obligation for Product Y and the performance obligation for Product Z (ie CU450 is allocated to each performance obligation).</p></body></paragraph>
