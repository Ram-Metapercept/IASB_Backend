At the end of the reporting period, a provision of 60,000 has been recognised. The provision has not been discounted as the effect of discounting is not material.

The provision is estimated using the assumption that decommissioning will take place in 60&#x2013;70 years&#x2019; time. However, there is a possibility that it will not take place until 100&#x2013;110 years&#x2019; time, in which case the present value of the costs will be significantly reduced.

If the costs were measured based upon the expectation that they would not be incurred until 2100&#x2013;2110 the provision would be reduced to 136 million.
