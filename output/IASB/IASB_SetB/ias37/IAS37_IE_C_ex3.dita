Ninety per cent of the eventual costs relate to the removal of the oil rig and restoration of damage caused by building it, and 10 per cent arise through the extraction of oil. At the end of the reporting period, the rig has been constructed but no oil has been extracted.</p><p base="SL153433" id="IAS37_P0305"><b>Present obligation as a result of a past obligating event</b> &#x2013; The construction of the oil rig creates a legal obligation under the terms of the licence to remove the rig and restore the seabed and is thus an obligating event. At the end of the reporting period, however, there is no obligation to rectify the damage that will be caused by extraction of the oil.</p><p base="SL153434" id="IAS37_P0306"><b>An outflow of resources embodying economic benefits in settlement</b> &#x2013; Probable.</p><p base="SL153435" id="IAS37_P0307"><b>Conclusion</b> &#x2013; A provision is recognised for the best estimate of ninety per cent of the eventual costs that relate to the removal of the oil rig and restoration of damage caused by building it (see <xref base="F16146442" href="IAS37_14.dita#IAS37_14" id="IAS37_X0252">paragraph 14</xref>). These costs are included as part of the cost of the oil rig. TheÂ 10 per cent of costs that arise through the extraction of oil are recognised as a liability when the oil is extracted.</p></body></topic>
