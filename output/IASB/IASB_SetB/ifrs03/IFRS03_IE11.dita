Because Entity A issues 2.5 shares in exchange for each ordinary share of Entity B, Entity A issues only 140 (rather than 150) shares. As a result, Entity B&#x2019;s shareholders own 58.3 per cent of the issued shares of the combined entity (140 of 240 issued shares). The fair value of the consideration transferred for Entity A, the accounting acquiree, is calculated by assuming that the combination had been effected by Entity B issuing additional ordinary shares to the shareholders of Entity A in exchange for their ordinary shares in Entity A. That is because Entity A is the accounting acquirer, and <xref id="IFRS03_X0594" base="F16123334" href="IFRS03_gB20-B20.dita#IFRS03_gB20-B20">paragraph B20 of IFRS 3</xref> requires the acquirer to measure the consideration exchanged for the accounting acquiree.</p></body></paragraph>
