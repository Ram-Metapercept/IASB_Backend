Furthermore,       Purchaser concludes that the criterion in <xref href="IFRS03_B8.dita">paragraph B8</xref> is met because those       substantive processes and inputs together significantly contribute to the ability       to create output. Consequently, Purchaser concludes that the acquired set of       activities and assets is a business.</p></body></paragraph>
