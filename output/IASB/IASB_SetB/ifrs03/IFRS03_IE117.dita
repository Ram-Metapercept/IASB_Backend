Consequently, Purchaser applies the criteria in <xref href="IFRS03_B12C.dita">paragraph B12C</xref> and concludes that the criterion in         <xref href="IFRS03_B12C.dita">paragraph B12C(a)</xref> is met because the set       includes an organised workforce with the necessary skills, knowledge or experience to perform       processes (customer relationship management and credit risk management) critical to the       ability to continue producing outputs. Furthermore, Purchaser concludes that the criterion in         <xref href="IFRS03_B8.dita">paragraph B8</xref> is met because those substantive       processes and the acquired inputs (the portfolio of loans) together significantly contribute       to the ability to create output. Consequently, Purchaser concludes that the acquired set is a       business.</p></body></paragraph>
