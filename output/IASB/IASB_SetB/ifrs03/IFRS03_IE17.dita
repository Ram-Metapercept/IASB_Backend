Those designated as having a non&#x2011;contractual basis do not arise from contractual or other legal rights but are separable. Intangible assets identified as having a contractual basis might also be separable but separability is not a necessary condition for an asset to meet the contractual&#x2011;legal criterion.</p></body></paragraph>
