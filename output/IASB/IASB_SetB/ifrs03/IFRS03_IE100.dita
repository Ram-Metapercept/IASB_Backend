Thus, Purchaser applies the criteria in <xref href="IFRS03_B12B.dita">paragraph B12B</xref>. The set       does not include an organised workforce, so it does not meet those criteria.       Consequently, Purchaser concludes that the acquired set of activities and assets       is not a business.</p></body></paragraph>
