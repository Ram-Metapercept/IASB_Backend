The entity also revises its estimates relating to the fulfilment cash flows in Year 3. Consequently, the entity recognises in profit or loss the effect of the revised claims relating to Year 2, and adjusts the contractual service margin for changes in the fulfilment cash flows for Year 3. This change is only related to incurred claims and does not affect the investment component.</p></body></paragraph>
