The entity estimates that the       fulfilment cash flows of the groups of underlying insurance contracts increase by 10 per cent,       from future cash outflows of CU300 to future cash outflows of CU330. Consequently, the entity       estimates the fulfilment cash flows of the reinsurance contract held also increase, from       future cash inflows of CU90 to future cash inflows of CU99.</p></body></paragraph>
