The sale requires regulatory approval, which could extend the period required to complete the sale beyond one year. Actions necessary to obtain that approval cannot be initiated until after a buyer is known and a firm purchase commitment is obtained. However, a firm purchase commitment is highly probable within one year. In that situation, the conditions in <xref base="F15831010" href="IFRS05_B1.dita#IFRS05_B1" id="IFRS05_X0301">paragraph B1(a)</xref> for an exception to the one&#x2011;year requirement in <xref base="F15831229" href="IFRS05_8.dita#IFRS05_8" id="IFRS05_X0302">paragraph 8</xref> would be met.</p></body></topic>
