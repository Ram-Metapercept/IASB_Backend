For           financial reporting purposes, the decommissioning obligation is recognised as a separate           liability, and is not deducted from the asset. Accordingly, if the asset is valued on a           net basis, it is necessary to adjust the valuation obtained by adding back the allowance           for the liability, so that the liability is not counted twice.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRIC01_FN0003" type="fn"/></p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRIC01_P0088" base="SL146189">if an asset is valued on a depreciated replacement cost basis, the valuation obtained may not include an amount for the decommissioning component of the asset. If it does not, an appropriate amount will need to be added to the valuation to reflect the depreciated replacement cost of that component.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
