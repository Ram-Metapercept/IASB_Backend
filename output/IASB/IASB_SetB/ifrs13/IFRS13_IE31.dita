Non&#x2011;performance risk relating to a liability includes, but may not be limited to, the entity&#x2019;s own credit risk. An entity takes into account the effect of its credit risk (credit standing) on the fair value of the liability in all periods in which the liability is measured at fair value because those that hold the entity&#x2019;s obligations as assets would take into account the effect of the entity&#x2019;s credit standing when estimating the prices they would be willing to pay.</p></body></paragraph>
