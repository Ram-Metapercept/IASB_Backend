Information about market transactions for comparable software assets is not available. The income and cost approaches are applied as follows:</p><ol id="IFRS13_L0061" base="F16133895" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS13_P0502" base="F16133896">The income approach is applied using a present value technique . The cash flows used in that technique reflect the income stream expected to result from the software asset (licence fees from customers) over its economic life. The fair value indicated by that approach is CU15 million.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS13_P0503" base="F16133898">The cost approach is applied by estimating the amount that currently would be required to construct a substitute software asset of comparable utility (ie taking into account functional and economic obsolescence). The fair value indicated by that approach is CU10 million.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
