When an asset is used in combination with other assets or with other assets and liabilities, the cost approach assumes the sale of the machine to a market participant buyer with the complementary assets and the associated liabilities . The price received for the sale of the machine (ie an exit price) would not be more than either of the following:</p><ol id="IFRS13_L0060" base="F16133886" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS13_P0498" base="F16133887">the cost that a market participant buyer would incur to acquire or construct a substitute machine of comparable utility; or</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS13_P0499" base="F16133889">the economic benefit that a market participant buyer would derive from the use of the machine.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
