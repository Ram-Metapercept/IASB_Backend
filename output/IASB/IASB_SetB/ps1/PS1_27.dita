For example, information about how management intends to address market trends and the threats and opportunities those market trends represent provides users of the financial reports with insight that may shape their expectations about the entity&#x2019;s future performance. Management should also explain how success will be measured and over what period of time it should be assessed.</p></body></paragraph>
