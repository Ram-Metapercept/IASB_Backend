At the end of Year 1, Entity B concludes it is not probable that the taxation authority will accept the tax treatment. Consequently, Entity B reflects the effect of the uncertainty in determining its taxable profit and the tax base of the intangible asset applying <xref id="IFRIC23_X0071" base="F59117456" href="IFRIC23_11.dita#IFRIC23_11">paragraph 11 of IFRIC 23</xref>. Entity B concludes the most likely amount that the taxation authority will accept as a deductible amount for Year 1 is CU10 and that the most likely amount better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty.</p></body></paragraph>
