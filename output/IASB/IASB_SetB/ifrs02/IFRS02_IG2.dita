The word &#x2018;agree&#x2019; is used in its usual sense, which means that there must be both an offer and acceptance of that offer. Hence, the date at which one party makes an offer to another party is not grant date. The date of grant is when that other party accepts the offer. In some instances, the counterparty explicitly agrees to the arrangement, eg by signing a contract. In other instances, agreement might be implicit, eg for many share&#x2011;based payment arrangements with employees, the employees&#x2019; agreement is evidenced by their commencing to render services.</p></body></paragraph>
