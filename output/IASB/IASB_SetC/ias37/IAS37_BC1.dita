Paragraph 68A specifies which costs an       entity includes in determining the cost of fulfilling a contract for the purpose of assessing       whether the contract is onerous. The Board added this clarification in response to a       recommendation from the IFRS Interpretations Committee, whose research indicated that:</p><ol type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>         <p>differing views on which costs to include could lead to material differences in the           financial statements of entities that enter into some types of contracts.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>         <p>the need for clarification was urgent. Following the withdrawal of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 11</ph>             <ph outputclass="standard_title">Construction Contracts</ph></ph>, entities are required           to apply IAS 37 instead of IAS 11 to assess whether construction contracts are onerous.           IAS 11 specified which costs to include, but IAS 37 did not.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
