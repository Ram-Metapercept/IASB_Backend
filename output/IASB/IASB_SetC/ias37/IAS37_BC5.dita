If the income from such a contract will exceed the incremental cost of fulfilling       it, the contract will improve the entity&#x2019;s financial position and performance. But, unless the       income will fully cover the cost of the capacity used, including that cost in assessing       whether the contract is onerous might suggest otherwise because the entity will recognise an       onerous contract provision and a loss when it incurs a present obligation by entering into the       contract. If that capacity were not used to fulfil the contract, such a loss would not be       recognised.</p></body></paragraph>
