Those holding this view       suggested that, because an entity will incur those other costs regardless of whether it       fulfils the contract under consideration, the costs are not costs of &#x2018;fulfilling the       contract&#x2019;&#x2014;they are costs of operating the business. Paragraph 18 of IAS 37 specifies that no       provision is recognised for costs that need to be incurred to operate in the future, and       paragraph 63 prohibits recognition of future operating losses.</p></body></paragraph>
