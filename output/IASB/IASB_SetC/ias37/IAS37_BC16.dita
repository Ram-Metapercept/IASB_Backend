The Board concluded that the more general description:</p><ol type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value><p>can be applied to all types of contract, rather than only to           contracts to deliver goods or provide services;</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value><p>avoids unintended consequences of slight differences in the           wording of examples in different IFRS Standards; and</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value><p>provides a framework within which an entity can judge whether a           particular cost relates directly to a contract.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
