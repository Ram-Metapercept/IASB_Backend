Paragraph 69 originally referred to assets &#x2018;dedicated to that       contract&#x2019;. However, the term &#x2018;dedicated&#x2019; could be read to apply only to assets used solely on       that contract, and not used on other contracts. The Board amended the terminology in paragraph       69 to clarify that the requirement to recognise any impairment loss before establishing an       onerous contract provision applies to all assets whose cost would be considered in assessing       whether the contract is onerous.</p></body></paragraph>
