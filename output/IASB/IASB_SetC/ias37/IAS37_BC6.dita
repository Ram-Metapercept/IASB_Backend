By entering into a contract at a price       that does not fully cover the cost of the capacity used, the entity has committed itself to       using that capacity to provide goods or services at a price that would not be sustainable if       all contracts were similarly priced. The entity has effectively committed itself to making a       loss on that capacity for the life of the contract. In the Board&#x2019;s view, including the cost of       the capacity used in assessing whether a contract is onerous provides information that is       relevant to users of financial statements and faithfully represents the effect of the contract       on the entity&#x2019;s financial position and performance. The Board noted that an entity would       disclose additional information about the contract if such information is relevant to an       understanding of the entity&#x2019;s financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
