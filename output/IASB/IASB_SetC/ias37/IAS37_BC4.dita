For       example, if an entity needs equipment to fulfil a contract to manufacture goods or provide       services, it may either hire the equipment for use only on that contract, or buy the equipment       and use it on several contracts. The Board concluded that to provide a faithful representation       of the effect of a contract on an entity&#x2019;s financial position, the entity should identify the       resources needed to fulfil the contract and include the cost of those resources, regardless of       how it expects to obtain them. Including only incremental costs in that assessment&#x2014;for       example, the costs of hiring equipment but not an allocation of the depreciation of purchased       equipment&#x2014;would fail to recognise the costs of resources shared with other contracts.</p></body></paragraph>
