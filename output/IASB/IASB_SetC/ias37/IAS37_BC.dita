IAS 37         was issued by the International Accounting Standards Committee in 1998 and was not         accompanied by a Basis for Conclusions. This Basis for Conclusions summarises the         considerations of the International Accounting Standards Board (Board) in developing         amendments to IAS 37. Individual Board members gave greater weight to some factors than to         others.</p>     </note></body></topic>
