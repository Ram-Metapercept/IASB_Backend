The Board concluded that the unavoidable costs of fulfilling a contract are the costs an       entity cannot avoid because it <i>has</i> the contract (as opposed to the costs the entity       could avoid if it <i>did not have</i> the contract). The costs an entity cannot avoid because       it has a contract include both the incremental costs of that contract and an allocation of       other costs that relate directly to fulfilling contracts, including that contract.</p></body></paragraph>
