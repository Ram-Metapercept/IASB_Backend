IFRS 17 requires insurers to       include all costs that relate directly to the fulfilment of a contract in assessing whether an       insurance contract is onerous. These costs include an allocation of fixed and variable       overheads directly attributable to fulfilling insurance contracts.</p></body></paragraph>
