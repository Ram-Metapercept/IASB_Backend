Several IFRS Standards&#x2014;such       as <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 2</ph>         <ph outputclass="standard_title">Inventories</ph></ph>&#x2014;specify the costs to include in       measuring a non-monetary asset. Although their detailed requirements differ, they all require       an entity to include both the incremental costs of purchasing or constructing the asset, and       an allocation of other directly related or directly attributable costs, such as production       overheads. The Board concluded that, in assessing whether a contract to deliver goods is       onerous, the way an entity determines the cost of fulfilling the contract should be broadly       consistent with the way it measures the cost of the goods when it holds them. Such consistency       leads to more useful information.</p></body></paragraph>
