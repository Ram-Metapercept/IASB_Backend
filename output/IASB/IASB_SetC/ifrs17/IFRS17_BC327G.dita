In some circumstances, all claim amounts are known at the acquisition date but remain unpaid. In such circumstances, the acquirer is not providing insurance coverage, the contract does not meet the definition of an insurance contract and the acquirer would account for the contract as a financial liability applying IFRS 3 and subsequently IFRS 9. The Board also observed that for contracts that meet the definition of an insurance contract at the acquisition date, an entity would need to consider whether any amounts payable to the policyholder meet the definition of an investment component (and are therefore excluded from insurance revenue).</p></body></paragraph>
