The Board observed that some previous accounting models combined these two adjustments by using discount rates adjusted for non-financial risk. However, the Board concluded that combining the two adjustments is inappropriate unless the risk is directly proportional to both the amount of the liability and the remaining time to maturity. Insurance contract liabilities often do not have these characteristics. For example, the average risk in a group of claims liabilities may rise over time because more complex claims incurred may take longer to resolve. Similarly, lapse risk may affect cash inflows more than it affects cash outflows. A single risk-adjusted discount rate is unlikely to capture such differences in risk. The Board therefore decided to require a separate risk adjustment for non-financial risk.</p></body></paragraph>
