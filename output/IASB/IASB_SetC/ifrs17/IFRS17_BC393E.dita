The approach described in paragraph BC393D would not involve the risk of hindsight. However, the Board concluded that applying that approach would be impracticable in almost all cases. Meeting the conditions necessary for an &#x2018;all or nothing&#x2019; approach would be a high hurdle that entities would overcome in only a narrow set of circumstances. Accordingly, the Board decided not to add those requirements to IFRS 17.</p></body></paragraph>
