The Board rejected this approach because the premiums, claims and expenses presented in profit or loss are not measured by applying commonly understood notions of revenue and expenses. In particular, the revenue is recognised before the entity has performed a service and the claims and expenses are recognised before they have been incurred.</p></body></paragraph>
