In particular, IFRS 4 included a &#x2018;temporary exemption&#x2019; that explicitly stated that an entity need not ensure that its accounting policies are relevant to the economic decision-making needs of users of financial statements or that such accounting policies are reliable. As a result, there was wide diversity in the financial reporting of insurance contracts across entities applying IFRS Standards, and within some entities&#x2019; financial statements. In addition, some of that financial reporting did not provide useful information about those contracts to users of financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
