The alternative (not adjusting the contractual service margin) would result in a gain or loss in profit or loss. However, the Board concluded that: (a) not adjusting the contractual service margin of the group from which the existing contract is derecognised; and (b) establishing the contractual service margin for the group that includes the new modified contract based on the premiums that would have been charged for that new contract would result in the contractual service margin of the two groups double&#x2011;counting the future profit to be earned from the contract. Hence, the Board decided that the contractual service margin of the group from which the existing contract has been derecognised should be adjusted.</p></body></paragraph>
