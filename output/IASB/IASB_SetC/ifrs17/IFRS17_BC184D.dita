In the Board&#x2019;s view, an entity recognising a loss in that circumstance would provide useful information to users of financial statements. The information would reflect that the entity does not have a right to either oblige policyholders to renew the contracts, or to reclaim the commissions from sales agents if policyholders choose not to renew the contracts.</p></body></paragraph>
