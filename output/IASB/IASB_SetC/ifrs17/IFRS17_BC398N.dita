For example, the Board decided       not to require specific disclosure of the carrying amounts of financial assets to which the       classification overlay has been applied, and of the adjustments resulting from applying the       classification overlay. Applying the classification overlay results in the comparative       information being more consistent with the application of <xref href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_TOC.dita">IFRS 9.</xref> As a result, applying the classification       overlay would improve rather than reduce the usefulness of information for users of financial       statements. Therefore, the Board concluded that requiring such quantitative disclosures would       impose costs on preparers of financial statements with little benefit to users of financial       statements.</p></body></paragraph>
