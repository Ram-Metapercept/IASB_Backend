IFRS 17 also requires an entity to consider all its substantive rights and obligations, whether they arise from contract, law or regulation. Thus, when referring to contractual terms the effects of law and regulation are also considered. These requirements are consistent with <xref base="F59367533" href="../ifrs14/IFRS15_TOC.dita#IFRS15_TOC0001/IFRS15_TOC0001_V2" id="IFRS17_X1476">IFRS 15</xref>. They apply when an entity considers how to classify a contract and when assessing the substantive rights and obligations for determining the boundary of a contract. However, in measuring a group of insurance contracts, IFRS 17 requires an entity to include estimates of future cash flows that are at the discretion of the entity and hence may not be enforceable. The Board&#x2019;s reasons for requiring such cash flows to be included in the measurement are set out in <xref base="F59367574" href="IFRS17_gBC167-BC170.dita#IFRS17_gBC167-BC170/IFRS17_gBC167-BC170_TI" id="IFRS17_X1477">paragraphs BC167&#x2013;BC169</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
