The expected present value is the probability-weighted mean of the present value of the possible cash flows. The Board also noted that, because IFRS 17 sets the measurement requirement as the probability-weighted mean of the present value of the possible cash flows, when an entity determines that amount, estimates of the probabilities associated with each cash flow scenario should be unbiased. In other words, the estimates should not be biased by the intention of attaining a predetermined result or inducing particular behaviour. A lack of bias is important because biased financial reporting information cannot faithfully represent economic phenomena. A lack of bias requires that estimates of cash flows and the associated probabilities should be neither conservative nor optimistic.</p></body></paragraph>
