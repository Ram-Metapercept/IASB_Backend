Subsequently it becomes apparent which contracts are likely to give rise to claims and which are not, and the number of contracts in each category is as expected. If the contracts were measured individually, the expected claims may cause the contracts for which they are likely to arise to become onerous, with an equal and opposite reduction in the fulfilment cash flows of the other contracts. The entity would recognise a loss for the onerous contracts immediately in profit or loss and an increase in the contractual service margin for the other contracts. That increase in the contractual service margin would not be recognised immediately in profit or loss but instead would be recognised over the current and future coverage period. In contrast, if the contracts were measured as one group, there would be no loss for a group of onerous contracts or increase in the contractual service margin to be recognised.</p></body></paragraph>
