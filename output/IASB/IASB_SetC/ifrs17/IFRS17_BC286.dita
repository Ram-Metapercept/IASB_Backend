Subsequent changes in the fulfilment cash flows that relate to the losses for groups of onerous contracts would also need to be excluded from insurance revenue, otherwise insurance revenue would be understated or overstated. Hence, the Board decided that some tracking of the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage would be needed. Further, the Board concluded that the complexity added by requiring this tracking was outweighed by the benefits of the more faithful representation of performance that would be provided to users of financial statements if the effect of favourable changes were recognised in profit or loss to the extent that they reverse losses previously recognised in profit or loss. Accordingly, IFRS 17 requires that, to the extent that favourable changes in the estimates of the fulfilment cash flows relating to future service reverse losses previously recognised in profit or loss, the changes should also be recognised in profit or loss.</p></body></paragraph>
