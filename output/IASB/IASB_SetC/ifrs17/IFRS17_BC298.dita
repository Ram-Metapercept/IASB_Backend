IFRS 17 requires a reinsurance contract held to be accounted for separately from the underlying insurance contracts to which it relates. This is because an entity that holds a reinsurance contract does not normally have a right to reduce the amounts it owes to the underlying policyholder by amounts it expects to receive from the reinsurer. The Board acknowledged that separate accounting for the reinsurance contracts and their underlying insurance contracts might create mismatches that some regard as purely accounting, for example on the timing of recognition (see <xref id="IFRS17_X1739" base="F59389191" href="IFRS17_gBC304-BC305.dita#IFRS17_gBC304-BC305/IFRS17_gBC304-BC305_TI">paragraphs BC304&#x2013;BC305</xref>), the measurement of the reinsurance contracts (see <xref id="IFRS17_X1740" base="F59389192" href="IFRS17_gBC310-BC315.dita#IFRS17_gBC310-BC315/IFRS17_gBC310-BC315_TI">paragraphs BC310&#x2013;BC312</xref>) and the recognition of profit (see <xref id="IFRS17_X1741" base="F59389193" href="IFRS17_BC313.dita#IFRS17_BC313">paragraph BC313</xref>). However, the Board concluded that accounting for a reinsurance contract held separately from the underlying insurance contracts gives a faithful representation of the entity&#x2019;s rights and obligations and the related income and expenses from both contracts.</p></body></paragraph>
