Therefore, as part of the June 2020 amendments, the Board added &#x2018;insurance contract services&#x2019; to the defined terms of IFRS 17 (see paragraph BC283A(d)) and inserted the defined term into the requirements in IFRS 17 for the recognition of the contractual service margin. Insurance contract services are the only services that an entity considers when determining coverage units and hence the recognition of the contractual service margin in profit or loss. </p></body></paragraph>
