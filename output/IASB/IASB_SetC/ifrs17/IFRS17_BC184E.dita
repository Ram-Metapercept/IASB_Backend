Such a requirement depicts the payment of up-front costs such as commissions as an asset that an entity expects to recover through both initial insurance contracts issued and expected renewals. The asset reflects the right of an entity to not pay again costs it had already paid to obtain renewals. The Board noted that the information resulting from the amendment is comparable to the information provided by IFRS 15 for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract.</p></body></paragraph>
