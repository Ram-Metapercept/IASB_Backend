The mismatch would have arisen if an entity determined the amounts recognised in profit or loss on the group of insurance contracts by applying both paragraph 89 of IFRS 17 (to include some insurance finance income or expenses in other comprehensive income) and paragraph B115 of IFRS 17 (the risk mitigation option).</p></body></paragraph>
