Instead, an entity is required to use a method that meets the principle           in paragraph B119 of reflecting the insurance contract services provided in each period.           In selecting a method that meets that principle, an entity considers (a) the benefits           provided to the policyholder under a contract with respect to the insurance contract           services provided, and (b) when those benefits are provided. Different methods may achieve           the principle depending on the facts and circumstances.</p>         <p outputclass="keep_with_next">In the fact pattern described in the request, the terms of           the annuity contract provide the policyholder with the right to claim a periodic amount           (CU100 in the example) from the start of the annuity period for as long as the           policyholder survives.

The policyholder also benefits             from transferring to the entity the risk related to the uncertainty about how long             they will survive. However, IFRS 17 requires an entity to account for that insurance             risk in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk, separately from the contractual             service margin.</p></li><li><li_value>b.</li_value><p>the benefits of being able to claim a periodic amount are             provided to the policyholder in each year of the policyholder&#x2019;s survival from the             start of the annuity period:</p>             <ol type="lower-roman"><li><li_value>i.</li_value><p>the policyholder has no right to claim an amount for                 surviving in periods before the start of the annuity period.

Paragraphs BC140&#x2013;BC141 of the Basis for Conclusions on IFRS 17 explain                 that an entity can accept insurance risk before it is obliged to perform an                 insurance coverage service.</p></li><li><li_value>ii.</li_value><p>survival in one year does not provide the policyholder                 with the right to claim amounts that compensate the policyholder for surviving in                 future years; that is, the policyholder&#x2019;s right to claim amounts in future years                 is contingent on the policyholder surviving in those future years.</p></li></ol>           </li></ol>         <p typeface="sansserif" outputclass="keep_with_next">The Committee&#x2019;s conclusion</p>         <p>The Committee concluded that, in applying IFRS 17 to determine the quantity of the           benefits of insurance coverage for survival provided under each annuity contract, a method           based on:</p>         <ol type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>a.</li_value><p>the amount of the annuity payment the policyholder is able             to validly claim (Method 1) meets the principle in paragraph B119 of IFRS 17 of             reflecting the insurance coverage provided in each period by:</p>             <ol type="lower-roman"><li><li_value>i.</li_value><p>assigning a quantity of the benefits only to periods in                 which an insured event (survival of the policyholder) can occur, resulting in a                 policyholder having a right to make a valid claim; and</p></li><li><li_value>ii.</li_value><p>aligning the quantity of the benefits provided in a                 period with the amount the policyholder is able to validly claim if an insured                 event occurs in that period.</p></li></ol>           </li><li><li_value>b.</li_value><p>the present value of expected future annuity payments             (Method 2) does not meet the principle in paragraph B119 of IFRS 17 of reflecting the             insurance coverage provided in each period because it would:</p>             <ol type="lower-roman"><li><li_value>i.</li_value><p>assign a quantity of the benefits to periods in which no                 insured event occurs (for example, to the deferral period of a deferred annuity                 contract); and</p></li><li><li_value>ii.</li_value><p>misrepresent the quantity of the benefits provided in a                 period by considering amounts the policyholder is able to claim and benefit from                 only in future periods.</p></li></ol>           </li></ol>         <p>The request asked only about the recognition of the contractual service margin in profit           or loss. For the annuity contracts described in the request, the entity accepts insurance           risk related to the uncertainty about how long the policyholder will survive. The           Committee noted that the entity would apply other requirements in IFRS 17 to recognise in           profit or loss&#x2014;separately from the contractual service margin&#x2014;the risk adjustment for           non-financial risk. The risk adjustment for non-financial risk represents the compensation           the entity requires for bearing the uncertainty about the amount and timing of the cash           flows that arise from non-financial risk. The Committee did not discuss these other           requirements.</p>         <p>Under a group of annuity contracts, an entity could provide other insurance contract           services to policyholders in addition to insurance coverage for survival&#x2014;for example,           insurance coverage for death in a deferral period or an investment-return service. The           conclusion in this agenda decision applies to insurance coverage for survival, regardless           of other services provided. If the contracts provide other insurance contract services,           the entity would also need to consider the pattern of transfer of these services to the           policyholder.</p>         <p>The Committee concluded that the principles and requirements in IFRS Accounting Standards           provide an adequate basis for an issuer of a group of annuity contracts as described in           the request to determine the amount of the contractual service margin to recognise in           profit or loss in a period because of the transfer of insurance coverage for survival in           that period.

The           first step in establishing groups of insurance contracts is to identify portfolios of           insurance contracts. Paragraph 14 of IFRS 17 states that &#x2018;a portfolio comprises contracts           subject to similar risks and managed together&#x2019;. The request asks whether currency exchange           rate risks are among the risks an entity considers when assessing whether insurance           contracts are &#x2018;subject to similar risks&#x2019;. </p>         <p>IFRS 17 defines financial risk and insurance risk (a non-financial risk). Financial risk           is defined to include &#x2018;the risk of a possible future change in &#x2026; [a] currency exchange           rate&#x2019;. When IFRS 17 requires an entity to consider or reflect only particular types of           risk (for example, only non-financial risk), it explicitly refers to the risks to be           considered or reflected. </p>         <p>Therefore, the Committee concluded that, because paragraph 14 of IFRS 17 refers to           &#x2018;similar risks&#x2019; without specifying any particular types of risk, an entity is required to           consider all risks&#x2014;including currency exchange rate risks&#x2014;when identifying portfolios of           insurance contracts. However, &#x2018;similar risks&#x2019; does not mean &#x2018;identical risks&#x2019;. Therefore,           an entity could identify portfolios of contracts that include contracts subject to           different currency exchange rate risks. The Committee observed that what an entity           considers to be &#x2018;similar risks&#x2019; will depend on the nature and extent of the risks in the           entity&#x2019;s insurance contracts.</p>         <p>...</p>         <p typeface="sansserif" outputclass="keep_with_next">Conclusion</p>         <p>In the light of its analysis, the Committee considered whether to add to the work plan a           standard-setting project on how to account for the foreign currency aspects of insurance           contracts. The Committee observed that it has not obtained evidence that such a project           would be sufficiently narrow in scope that the International Accounting Standards Board           (IASB) or the Committee could address it in an efficient manner.

The entity could determine that the group&#x2014;including the contractual service margin&#x2014;is               denominated in a single currency or in the multiple currencies of the cash flows in               the group. </p></li></ol>         <p>The entity develops an accounting policy on currency denomination that results in           information that is relevant and reliable (as described in paragraph 10 of IAS 8             <i>Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors</i>) and is applied           consistently for similar transactions, other events and conditions (paragraph 13 of IAS           8).

Appendix A to IFRS 17 defines the contractual service margin as           representing &#x2018;the unearned profit the entity will recognise as it provides insurance           contract services under the insurance contracts in the group.&#x2019; Accordingly, under a           multi-currency denomination, the entity would:</p>         <ol type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value><p>assess whether the group of contracts is onerous               considering the contractual service margin as a single amount.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value><p>prevent the carrying amount of the contractual service               margin being negative by, when necessary to do so, recognising a loss.</p>           </li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value><p>determine the amount of the contractual service margin to               recognise in profit or loss by applying a single method of determining the coverage               units provided in the current period and expected to be provided in the future to the               amounts denominated in the multiple currencies. This would result in the entity               allocating each of the currency amounts of the contractual service margin translated               into the functional currency equally to each coverage unit.</p></li></ol>         <p typeface="sansserif">Conclusion</p>         <p>In the light of its analysis, the Committee considered whether to add to the work plan a           standard-setting project on how to account for the foreign currency aspects of insurance           contracts. The Committee observed that it has not obtained evidence that such a project           would be sufficiently narrow in scope that the International Accounting Standards Board           (IASB) or the Committee could address it in an efficient manner. Consequently, the           Committee decided not to add a standard-setting project to the work plan.</p>       </fn>     </bodydiv></body></topic>
