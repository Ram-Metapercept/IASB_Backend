This documentation requirement is analogous to                 the documentation requirements for hedge accounting in <xref href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_TOC.dita#IFRS09_TOC0001">IFRS 9</xref>. Consistent with                 the transition requirements for hedge accounting in IFRS 9, the Board concluded that                 retrospective application of the risk mitigation treatment would give rise to the                 risk of hindsight. In particular, the Board was concerned that documentation after                 the event could enable entities to choose the risk mitigation relationships to which                 it would apply this option, particularly because the application of this approach is                 optional. Consequently, IFRS 17, consistent with the transition requirements for                 hedge accounting in IFRS 9, requires prospective application of the risk mitigation                 option from the date of initial application of the Standard.<xref type="fn" keyref="footnotes/IFRS17_BC393_FN0002"/></p>         </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
