Accordingly, the Board decided to require that an entity provides disclosures that enable users of financial statements to identify the effect of groups of insurance contracts measured at the transition date applying the modified retrospective approach or the fair value approach on the contractual service margin and revenue in subsequent periods. Furthermore, the Board decided that entities should explain how they determined the measurement of insurance contracts that existed at the transition date for all periods in which these disclosures are required, for users of financial statements to understand the nature and significance of the methods used and judgements applied.</p></body></paragraph>
