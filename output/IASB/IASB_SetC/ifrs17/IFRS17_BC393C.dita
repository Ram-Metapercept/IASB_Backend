The Board observed that if an entity were permitted to apply the option retrospectively, it could decide the extent to which it reflects risk mitigation activities in the contractual service margin based on known accounting outcomes. The entity could apply the option in a way that differs from how the entity would have applied the option in previous periods without hindsight, had it always applied IFRS 17. Permitting retrospective application of the option would therefore affect the credibility of information presented on transition to IFRS 17 and in subsequent periods in which those groups of insurance contracts exist. The Board therefore reaffirmed its decision to prohibit retrospective application of the option because of the risk of the use of hindsight.</p></body></paragraph>
