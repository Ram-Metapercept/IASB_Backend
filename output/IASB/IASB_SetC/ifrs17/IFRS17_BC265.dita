When         applying IFRS 17, payments to policyholders form part of the fulfilment cash flows         regardless of whether those payments are expected to be made to current or future         policyholders. Thus, the fulfilment cash flows of an insurer that is a mutual entity         generally include the rights of policyholders to the whole of any surplus of assets over         liabilities. This means that, for an insurer that is a mutual entity, there should, in         principle, normally be no equity remaining and no net comprehensive income reported in any         accounting period.<xref type="fn" keyref="footnotes/IFRS17_BC265-BC269_FN0001"/></p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
