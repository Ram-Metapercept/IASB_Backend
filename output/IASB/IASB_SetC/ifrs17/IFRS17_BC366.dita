A change of basis is required if the entity becomes eligible, or ceases to be eligible, to apply the current period book yield because it starts to hold, or ceases to hold, the underlying items for a group of insurance contracts. In such cases, IFRS 17 requires an entity to include in a specified way in profit or loss the accumulated amount previously recognised in other comprehensive income. The Board requires the specified method to prevent an entity from including or excluding gains and losses permanently in profit or loss simply by choosing to buy or sell underlying items. The Board also decided to require entities to disclose, in the period the change in basis occurs:</p><ol id="IFRS17_L0547" base="F55754161" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS17_P6489" base="F55754162">the reason why the entity changed the basis of disaggregation;</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS17_P6490" base="F55754165">the amount of any adjustment for each financial statement line item affected; and</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS17_P6491" base="F55754167">the carrying amount of the groups of insurance contracts to which the change applied.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
