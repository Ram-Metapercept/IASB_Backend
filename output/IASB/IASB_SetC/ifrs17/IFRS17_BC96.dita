The Board noted that, if IFRS 17 were to apply, entities would generally apply the premium allocation approach to such contracts, which would result in accounting similar to that which would result from applying IFRS 15. Further, the Board decided the practice of accounting for these contracts in the same way as other contracts with customers would provide useful information for the users of financial statements for the entities that issue such contracts. Hence, the Board thought that changing the accounting for these contracts would impose costs and disruption for no significant benefit.</p></body></paragraph>
