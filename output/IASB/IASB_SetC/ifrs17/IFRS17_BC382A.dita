However, the Board amended IFRS 17 to       provide reliefs on transition in response to feedback that to apply IFRS 17 retrospectively to       contracts acquired before the transition date (that is, to classify and measure those       contracts as a liability for remaining coverage) would often be impracticable. Those reliefs       permit an entity applying the modified retrospective approach or the fair value approach to       classify as a liability for incurred claims a liability for the settlement of claims when:</p><ol><li><li_value>(a)</li_value><p>that liability relates to an insurance contract that was acquired in a transfer of insurance contracts that do not form a business or in a business combination within the scope of IFRS 3; and</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value><p>the acquisition date was before the transition date.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
