At all times,         the liability for the group is measured as the sum of the fulfilment cash flows, including         any expected future insurance acquisition cash flows, and the contractual service margin.         Because the contractual service margin cannot be less than zero, the entity need not test         separately whether it will recover the insurance acquisition cash flows that have occurred         but have not yet been recognised as an expense. The measurement model captures any lack of         recoverability automatically by remeasuring the fulfilment cash flows.<xref type="fn" keyref="footnotes/IFRS17_BC180_BC184_FN0001"/></p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
