The Board rejected this suggestion. The Board concluded that specifying methods would conflict       with the approach in IFRS 17 of establishing measurement objectives that can be satisfied       using various methods. The appropriateness of a method depends on facts and circumstances.       Furthermore, if the Board were to specify methods, it could risk incorrectly implying that       entities cannot use other methods that would satisfy the requirements of IFRS 17.</p></body></paragraph>
