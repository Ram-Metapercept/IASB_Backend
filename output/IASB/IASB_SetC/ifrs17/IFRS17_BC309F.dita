However, the Board concluded that the benefits of appropriately reflecting an entity&#x2019;s rights and obligations as the holder of a reinsurance contract outweigh those costs. Accordingly, the Board rejected the suggestion to amend the contract boundary requirements in IFRSâ€¯17 for reinsurance contracts held.</p></body></paragraph>
