To         limit the reduction in comparability, the Board decided that an entity may make this choice         only to the extent that, in accordance with a previously documented risk management         objective and strategy for using derivatives to mitigate financial market risk arising from         those fulfilment cash flows:<xref type="fn" keyref="footnotes/IFRS17_BC255_FN0001"/></p>       <ol id="IFRS17_L0514" base="F55753462" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>           <p id="IFRS17_P6287" base="F55753463">the entity uses a derivative to mitigate the             financial risk arising from the group of insurance contracts.<xref type="fn" keyref="footnotes/IFRS17_BC255_FN0002"/></p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>           <p id="IFRS17_P6288" base="F55753465">an economic offset exists between the group of             insurance contracts and the derivative, ie the values of the group of insurance             contracts and the derivative generally move in opposite directions because they respond             in a similar way to the changes in the risk being mitigated.
