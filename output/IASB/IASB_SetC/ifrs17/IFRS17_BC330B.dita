However, entities implementing IFRS 17 told the Board that they would need to allocate some fulfilment cash flows to groups only for the purpose of presentation (for example, fulfilment cash flows for incurred claims). These entities said that an amendment to require an entity to present insurance contracts at a portfolio level would provide significant operational relief. Feedback on the 2019 Exposure Draft, including from users of financial statements, suggested that the amendment would not  significantly diminish the usefulness of information compared to that which would have been provided without the amendment.</p></body></paragraph>
