An entity is therefore required to apply the IFRS 17 transition requirements         instead of the general requirements of <xref base="F59415703" href="../ias08/IAS08_TOC.dita#IAS08_TOC0001" id="IFRS17_X1867">IAS 8 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and               Errors</ph></ph></xref>. In the light of the diversity in previous insurance         accounting practices and the long duration of many types of insurance contracts, the Board         decided that retrospective application of IFRS 17 provides the most useful information to         users of financial statements by allowing comparisons between contracts written before and         after the date of initial application of the Standard. Consistent with IAS 8, which requires         retrospective application of a new accounting policy except when it would be impracticable,         the Board concluded that entities should apply IFRS 17 retrospectively (see <xref base="F59415704" href="IFRS17_gBC374-BC378.dita#IFRS17_gBC374-BC378/IFRS17_gBC374-BC378_TI" id="IFRS17_X1868">paragraphs           BC374&#x2013;BC378</xref>) and should be allowed to use alternatives only when         retrospective application of IFRS 17 is impracticable.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS17_BC372_FN0001" type="fn"/></p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
