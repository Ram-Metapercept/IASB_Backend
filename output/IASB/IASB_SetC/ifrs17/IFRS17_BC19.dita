The estimate of future cash flows             reflects the perspective of the entity, provided that the estimates of any relevant             market variables are consistent with the observable market prices for those variables             (see <xref id="IFRS17_X1385" base="F59357561" href="IFRS17_gBC147-BC157.dita#IFRS17_gBC147-BC157/IFRS17_gBC147-BC157_TI">paragraphs               BC147&#x2013;BC184N</xref>).</p>         </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>           <p id="IFRS17_P5809" base="F55750925">an adjustment for the time value of money and the             financial risks associated with the future cash flows, to the extent that the financial             risks are not included in the estimate of the future cash flows. For example, if the             cash flows being discounted are an estimate of the probability-weighted average (the             mean), that mean itself does not include an adjustment for risk, and any financial risk             (ie uncertainty relating to financial risk on whether the ultimate cash flows will equal             the mean) will be included in the discount rate (a risk-adjusted rate). If, in contrast,             the cash flows being discounted are an estimate of the mean with an adjustment to             reflect uncertainty related to financial risk, the discount rate will be a rate that             reflects only the time value of money (ie not adjusted for risk). The discount rates are             consistent with observable current market prices for instruments whose cash flow             characteristics are consistent with the estimates of the cash flows of the insurance             contracts. The discount rates also exclude the effects of any factors that influence             observable market prices but are not relevant to the estimates of the cash flows of the             insurance contracts (see <xref id="IFRS17_X1386" base="F59357562" href="IFRS17_gBC185-BC205.dita#IFRS17_gBC185-BC205/IFRS17_gBC185-BC205_TI">paragraphs               BC185&#x2013;BC205B</xref>).</p>         </li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value>           <p id="IFRS17_P5810" base="F55750927">an adjustment for the effects of non-financial risk,             referred to as a risk adjustment for non-financial risk. The risk adjustment for             non-financial risk is defined as the compensation that the entity requires for bearing             the uncertainty about the amount and timing of the cash flows that arises from             non-financial risk (see <xref id="IFRS17_X1387" base="F59357563" href="IFRS17_gBC206-BC217.dita#IFRS17_gBC206-BC217/IFRS17_gBC206-BC217_TI">paragraphs               BC206&#x2013;BC217</xref>).</p>         </li></ol>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
