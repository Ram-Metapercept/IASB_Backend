Separating a single contract into components could result in complex accounting that does not provide useful information for interdependent cash flows attributable to the components. Furthermore, when cash flows are interdependent, separating the cash flows for each component can be arbitrary, particularly if the contract includes cross-subsidies between components or discounts. Also, as noted in <xref id="IFRS17_X1526" base="F59367798" href="IFRS17_BC10.dita#IFRS17_BC10">paragraph BC10(a)</xref>, when separation ignores interdependencies between components, the sum of the values of the components may not always equal the value of the contract as a whole, even on initial recognition.</p></body></paragraph>
