Explicit estimates also reduce the possibility that the entity does not identify some changes in circumstances. However, IFRS 17 allows an exception to the requirement to use explicit estimates of cash flows separate from the adjustment to reflect the time value of money and financial risks. This exception applies if the entity uses the fair value of a replicating portfolio of assets to measure some of the cash flows that arise from insurance contracts, which will combine the cash flows and the adjustment to reflect the time value of money and financial risks. The fair value of a replicating portfolio of assets reflects both the expected present value of the cash flows from the portfolio of assets and the risk associated with those cash flows (see <xref id="IFRS17_X1609" base="F59369407" href="IFRS17_B46.dita#IFRS17_B46">paragraph B46 of IFRS 17</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
