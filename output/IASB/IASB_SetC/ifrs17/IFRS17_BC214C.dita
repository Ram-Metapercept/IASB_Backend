The Board concluded that doing so would address       only some differences that could arise in the application of the requirements for determining       the risk adjustment for non-financial risk, given the judgement required to apply those       requirements. The Board concluded that practice needs to develop in this area. If necessary,       the Board will seek to understand how the requirements are being applied as part of the       Post-implementation Review of IFRSâ€¯17.</p></body></paragraph>
