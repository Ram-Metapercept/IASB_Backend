For transfers of insurance contracts, the most likely cause of the difference is that the fair value would include the risk of non-performance by the entity. The Board concluded that, for contracts in a liability position acquired in a transfer, the immediate recognition of a loss faithfully represents the entity&#x2019;s assumption of an obligation it expects to fulfil but for which it received a lower price because of the risk that it might not be able to fulfil the obligation.</p></body></paragraph>
