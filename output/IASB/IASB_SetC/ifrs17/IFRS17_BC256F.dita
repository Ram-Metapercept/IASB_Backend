Some stakeholders said that an entity may mitigate such       financial risk by investing premiums in assets other than the underlying items&#x2014;for example,       fixed rate bonds. The Board concluded that permitting an entity to apply the risk mitigation       option in that circumstance would contradict the principle that an entity need not hold the       underlying items for the variable fee approach to apply (see paragraph BC246).</p></body></paragraph>
