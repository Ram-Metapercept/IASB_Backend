The expected cash outflows include outflows over which the entity has discretion. The Board decided to require this because:</p><ol id="IFRS17_L0483" base="F55751629" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS17_P6116" base="F55751630">it can be difficult to determine whether an entity is making payments because it believes that it is obliged to do so, rather than for some other reason that does not justify the recognition of a stand-alone liability. Those reasons could be to maintain the entity&#x2019;s competitive position or because the entity believes it is under some moral pressure. Thus, it could be difficult to make a reasonable estimate of the level of distribution that would ultimately be enforceable in the unlikely event that an entity asserts that its discretion to pay or withhold amounts to policyholders is unfettered.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS17_P6117" base="F55751632">even if it were possible to make a reasonable estimate of non-discretionary cash flows, users of financial statements would not benefit from knowing how much might be enforceable in the highly unlikely event that an entity tried to avoid paying amounts to policyholders of insurance contracts when the entity and its policyholders currently expect that such benefits will be paid. That amount does not provide relevant information about the amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows. On the other hand, users of financial statements would want to know:</p> <ol id="IFRS17_L0484" base="F55751634" type="lower-roman"><li><li_value>(i)</li_value> <p id="IFRS17_P6118" base="F55751635">how much of the cash flows will be unavailable to investors because the entity expects to pay them to policyholders. The requirements in IFRS 17 convey that information by including those cash flows in the measurement of the liability.</p></li><li><li_value>(ii)</li_value> <p id="IFRS17_P6119" base="F55751637">how much of the risk in the contracts is borne by the policyholders through the participation mechanism and how much by the shareholders. This information is conveyed by the required disclosures about risk.</p></li></ol></li></ol></body></paragraph>
