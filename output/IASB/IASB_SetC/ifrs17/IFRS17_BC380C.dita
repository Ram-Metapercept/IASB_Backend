The Board noted that paragraph 51 of IAS 8 acknowledges the need for estimates in retrospective application. This paragraph applies to entities applying IFRS 17 for the first time just as it does to entities applying other IFRS Standards for the first time. The Board expects that entities will often need to make estimates when applying a specified modification in the modified retrospective approach.</p></body></paragraph>
