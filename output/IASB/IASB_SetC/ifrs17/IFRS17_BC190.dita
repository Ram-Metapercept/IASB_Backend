However, this approach of implicitly discounting the liability makes the unrealistic assumption that two variables (claim inflation and the effect of timing) will more or less offset each other in every case. As this is unlikely, the Board concluded that financial reporting will be improved if entities estimate those effects separately.</p></body></paragraph>
