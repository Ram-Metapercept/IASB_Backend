The Board views the premium allocation approach as a simplification of those general requirements. To simplify its application, the Board also decided to provide guidance that an entity could assume, without further investigation, that the approach provides a reasonable approximation of the general requirements of IFRS 17 if the coverage period of each contract in the group is one year or less.</p></body></paragraph>
