Some stakeholders said this is an accounting mismatch and suggested the Board amend IFRS 17 so that income is recognised on the reinsurance contract held at the same time losses are recognised on initial recognition of onerous underlying insurance contracts. That income would reflect the entity&#x2019;s right to recover those losses.</p></body></paragraph>
