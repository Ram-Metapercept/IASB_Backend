The Board decided to require entities to make the accounting policy choice for each portfolio because a key factor in making the choice will be what assets the entity regards as backing the insurance contracts. The Board received feedback that many entities regard the choice of strategies for assets backing insurance contracts to be driven by the differences between portfolios of insurance contracts. Hence, an entity might hold financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income for one portfolio, and for another portfolio, hold financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss. Accordingly, an option applied to portfolios of insurance contracts would allow entities to reduce accounting mismatches. The Board concluded that even if it were to allow an accounting policy choice, entities within the same jurisdiction are likely to remain comparable because they are likely to issue similar products and adopt similar asset strategies for those products. Thus, the entities are likely to make similar accounting policy choices.</p></body></paragraph>
