The Board also decided that the entity need not hold the underlying items, because the measurement of insurance contracts should not depend on what assets the entity holds. The Board extended the adjustments to the contractual service margin as described in <xref id="IFRS17_X1706" base="F59389019" href="IFRS17_BC239.dita#IFRS17_BC239">paragraphs BC239&#x2013;BC240</xref> to reflect the view that the entity&#x2019;s share of underlying items is part of the variable fee for service. In such cases, variability in the fee is driven by changes in assumptions relating to financial risk. Therefore, the Board decided that it is also appropriate to regard as part of the fee the effect of changes in assumptions relating to financial risk on the fulfilment cash flows that do not vary based on returns on the underlying items.</p></body></paragraph>
