Insurance measurement models before IFRS 17 often required entities to make estimates at initial recognition and to use the same estimates throughout the duration of the contract, without updating to include information that became available later in the duration of the contract. However, the Board concluded that using current estimates:</p><ol base="F55751567" id="IFRS17_L0478" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p base="F55751568" id="IFRS17_P6087">gives more relevant information about the entity&#x2019;s contractual obligations and rights by better reflecting information about the amounts, timing and uncertainty of the cash flows generated by those obligations and rights. Because of the uncertainty associated with insurance contract liabilities and the long duration of many insurance contracts, current information reflecting the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows is particularly relevant for users of financial statements.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p base="F55751570" id="IFRS17_P6088">incorporates all reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost or effort in the measurement, thus avoiding the need for a separate test to ensure that the liability is not understated (sometimes known as a &#x2018;liability adequacy test&#x2019;). Any liability adequacy test is likely to involve some arbitrary components. For example, any specified timing for such a test would inevitably be arbitrary, unless current information were required at each reporting date.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p base="F55751572" id="IFRS17_P6089">is broadly consistent with other IFRS Standards for provisions (<xref base="F59369361" href="../ias37/IAS37_TOC.dita#IAS37_TOC0001" id="IFRS17_X1603">IAS 37</xref>) and financial liabilities (<xref base="F70527930" href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_TOC.dita#IFRS09_TOC0001" id="IFRS17_X1604">IFRS 9</xref>). That is, for liabilities with characteristics similar to insurance contract liabilities, both IAS 37 and IFRS 9 would require measurements based on current estimates of future cash flows.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
