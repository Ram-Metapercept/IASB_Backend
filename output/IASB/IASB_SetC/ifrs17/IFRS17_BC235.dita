The         Board did not regard as useful information, for example, the recognition of a gain for a         delay in repaying an investment component accompanied by a loss that adjusts the contractual         service margin for the expected later repayment. Acceleration or delay in repayments of         investment components only gives rise to a gain or loss for the entity to the extent that         the amount of the repayment is affected by its timing. Also, IFRS 17 does not require an         entity to determine the amount of an investment component until a claim is incurred (see           <xref id="IFRS17_X1698" base="F59385090" href="IFRS17_BC34.dita#IFRS17_BC34">paragraph           BC34</xref>). Accordingly, when a claim is incurred, IFRS 17 requires an entity to         determine how much of that claim is an investment component, and whether it was expected to         become payable that period. IFRS 17 requires any unexpected repayment of an investment         component to adjust the contractual service margin. The contractual service margin will also         be adjusted for changes in future estimates of cash flows which will include (but not         separately identify) the reduction in future repayments of investment components. This         achieves the desired result of the net effect on the contractual service margin being the         effect of the change in timing of the repayment of the investment component.<xref type="fn" keyref="footnotes/IFRS17_BC235_FN0001"/></p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
