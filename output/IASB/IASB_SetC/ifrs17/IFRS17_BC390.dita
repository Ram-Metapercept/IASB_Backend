The Board noted that reflecting the effect of contracts derecognised before the transition date on the remaining contractual service margin was necessary to provide a faithful representation of the remaining profit of the group of insurance contracts. Furthermore, although entities may have difficulty obtaining details of cash flows for all contracts that have been derecognised, the Board concluded that an entity would be able to make estimates and extrapolations using reasonable and supportable information to enable the effect of derecognised contracts to be determined. Finally, the Board observed that when an entity is not able to make such estimates and extrapolations, the fair value approach would be available.</p></body></paragraph>
