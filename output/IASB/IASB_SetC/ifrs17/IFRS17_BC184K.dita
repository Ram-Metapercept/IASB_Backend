An impairment test at a group level compares the carrying amount of an asset for insurance acquisition cash flows allocated to a group with the expected net cash inflow of the group. That net cash inflow includes cash flows for contracts unrelated to any expected renewals but expected to be in that group. The Board therefore decided to require an additional impairment test specific to cash flows for expected renewals. This additional impairment test results in the recognition of any impairment losses when the entity no longer expects the renewals supporting the asset to occur, or expects the net cash inflows to be lower than the amount of the asset. Without the additional impairment test, cash flows from contracts unrelated to any expected renewals might prevent the recognition of such an impairment loss.</p></body></paragraph>
