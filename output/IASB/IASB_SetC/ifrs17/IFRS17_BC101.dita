The term &#x2018;closely related&#x2019; is used in <xref base="F70527846" href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_TOC.dita#IFRS09_TOC0001" id="IFRS17_X1527">IFRS 9</xref> in the criteria that determine whether embedded derivatives must be bifurcated. However, stakeholders indicated that some were unsure how to interpret the term closely related for non-insurance components embedded in insurance contracts. The Board noted that the principles for separating embedded derivatives were long-established in IFRS 9 (and previously in <xref base="F61090892" href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001/IAS39_TOC0001_V3" id="IFRS17_X1528">IAS 39 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement</ph></ph></xref>). However, IFRS 17 clarifies the principles for the separation of other non&#x2011;insurance components from an insurance contract based on the principles developed in <xref base="F59367840" href="../ifrs14/IFRS15_TOC.dita#IFRS15_TOC0001/IFRS15_TOC0001_V2" id="IFRS17_X1529">IFRS 15</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
