Entities might also       conclude that an investment-return service exists in circumstances in which the Board would       conclude otherwise (for example, when an entity provides only custodial services relating to       an investment component). On the other hand, specifying conditions creates the risk of an       inappropriate outcome in some scenarios.</p></body></paragraph>
