Some expressed concern about this and hence questioned whether the service provided by an insurance contract was adequately represented by the change in the measurement of an entity&#x2019;s obligation. Rather, they thought that revenue (the gross amount) ought to be determined independently of changes in the obligation (the net amount). One way of doing this would be to use time-based methods for measuring progress, such as those typically used for other contracts. However, the Board concluded that time-based methods of allocating premiums would not reflect the fact that the value of the services provided in each period may differ. Instead, the Board noted that the amount reported as the liability for remaining coverage represents the value of the obligation to provide services. The Board therefore concluded that the reduction in the liability for remaining coverage is a reasonable representation of the value of the performance obligation to provide services that was satisfied in the period. The reduction in the liability for remaining coverage includes an allocation of the contractual service margin to reflect the services provided in the period. That allocation reflects the quantity of benefits provided and duration of contracts in a group. The other changes in the liability for remaining coverage that represent revenue for the period are measured using current assumptions. The total change in the liability for remaining coverage that represents revenue therefore faithfully represents the amount of insurance revenue that the entity is entitled to.</p></body></paragraph>
