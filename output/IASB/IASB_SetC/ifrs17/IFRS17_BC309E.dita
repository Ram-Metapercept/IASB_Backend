They said such a mismatch arises because expected future cash flows that relate to the reinsurance of those insurance contracts will be included in the measurement of the reinsurance contract held before those underlying insurance contracts are issued. The Board disagreed that differences between the carrying amount of the reinsurance contract held and the underlying insurance contracts are accounting mismatches. The carrying amount of a reinsurance contract held is nil before any cash flows occur or any service is received.  Thereafter any differences that arise between the carrying amount of the reinsurance contract held and the underlying insurance contracts are not accounting mismatches. Rather they are differences caused by:</p><ol><li><li_value>(a)</li_value><p>the provision of coverage&#x2014;for example, because the reinsurer provides coverage for less than 100 per cent of the risks the entity covers;</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value><p>the timing of cash flows; and</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value><p>interest accreted on the contractual service margin of the reinsurance contract held from an earlier period than, and at a different discount rate from, the interest accreted on the contractual service margin of the underlying insurance contracts, reflecting the different effects of the time value of money on the contractual service margin and fulfilment cash flows.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
