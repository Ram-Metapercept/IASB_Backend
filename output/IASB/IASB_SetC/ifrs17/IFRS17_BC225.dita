The reasons underlying that view were that:</p><ol id="IFRS17_L0504" base="F55753359" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS17_P6232" base="F55753360">changes in estimates during a reporting period are economic changes in the cost of fulfilling a group of insurance contracts in that period, even when they relate to future service. Recognising changes in estimates immediately in profit or loss would provide relevant information about changes in circumstances for insurance contracts.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS17_P6233" base="F55753362">the contractual service margin represents an obligation to provide services that is separate from the obligation to make the payments required to fulfil the contracts. Changes in the estimates of the payments required to fulfil the contracts do not increase or decrease the obligation to provide services and consequently do not adjust the measurement of that obligation.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS17_P6234" base="F55753364">there would be accounting mismatches for changes in the estimates of financial market variables, such as discount rates and equity prices, if the assets that back insurance contract liabilities were measured at fair value through profit or loss and the contractual service margin was adjusted for those changes rather than being recognised in profit or loss.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
