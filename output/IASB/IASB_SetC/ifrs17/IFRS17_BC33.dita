The Board decided that when an investment component is interrelated with the                 insurance components in an insurance contract, it is appropriate to measure both the                 investment component and the insurance component in accordance with IFRS 17, for the                 reasons set out in <xref base="F59357714" href="IFRS17_BC10.dita#IFRS17_BC10" id="IFRS17_X1415">paragraphs BC10(a)</xref> and <xref base="F59357715" href="IFRS17_gBC108-BC109.dita#IFRS17_gBC108-BC109/IFRS17_gBC108-BC109_TI" id="IFRS17_X1416">BC108</xref>. However, the Board decided that it would not                 faithfully represent the similarities between financial instruments within the <xref base="F70527843" href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_g2.1-2.7.dita#IFRS09_g2.1-2.7/IFRS09_g2.1-2.7_TI" id="IFRS17_X1417">scope of IFRS 9</xref> and investment components embedded in                 insurance contracts within the <xref base="F59357757" href="IFRS17_g3-13.dita#IFRS17_g3-13/IFRS17_g3-13_TI" id="IFRS17_X1418">scope of                     IFRS 17</xref> if an entity were to present the receipts and repayments of such                 investment components as insurance revenue and incurred claims. To do so would be                 equivalent to a bank recognising a deposit as revenue and its repayment as an                 expense. Accordingly, the requirements of the Standard exclude such investment                 components from insurance revenue and incurred claims.<xref type="fn" keyref="footnotes/IFRS17_BC33_FN0002"/></p>         </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
