IFRS 9 determines classification based on the contractual cash flow characteristics of a financial asset and the business model in which it is held. After IFRS 9 is applied, changes in classification can only occur when an entity&#x2019;s business model changes; the Board expects such changes to be infrequent. In addition, IFRS 9 does not usually permit either subsequent redesignation under the fair value option or subsequent redesignation of equity instruments into, or out of, the category of equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income after initial recognition.</p></body></paragraph>
