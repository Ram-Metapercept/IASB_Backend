Further, the suggestion in paragraph BC256D would have resulted in any ineffectiveness of the risk mitigation strategy being recognised in other comprehensive income. That would be inconsistent with the hedge accounting requirements in IFRS 9 which result in the ineffectiveness of hedging strategies having a transparent effect on profit or loss. The Board observed that an entity could avoid mismatches by applying together the fair value option in IFRS 9 (to designate financial assets at fair value through profit or loss) and the risk mitigation option in IFRS 17.</p></body></paragraph>
