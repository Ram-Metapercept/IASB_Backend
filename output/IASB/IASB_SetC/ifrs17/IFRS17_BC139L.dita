For example, an entity may be required under the terms of the insurance contracts to pay policyholders a minimum of 90 per cent of the total fair value returns on a specified pool of underlying items, but have discretion to pay more. The Board acknowledged that an entity with such discretion is required to apply additional judgement compared to an entity without such discretion to allocate changes in fulfilment cash flows between groups in a way that appropriately reflects the effect of risk sharing and the effect of the discretion. However, that judgement is required to measure new contracts recognised in a period, so would be needed even without the annual cohort requirement.</p></body></paragraph>
