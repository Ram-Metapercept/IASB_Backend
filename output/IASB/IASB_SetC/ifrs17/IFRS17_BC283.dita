Thus, the recognition period for                 the contractual service margin is the coverage period over which the entity provides                 the coverage promised in the insurance contract, rather than the period over which                 the liability is expected to be settled. The margin the entity recognises for                 bearing risk is recognised in profit or loss as the entity is released from risk in                 both the coverage period and the settlement period.<xref type="fn" keyref="footnotes/IFRS17_BC279_BC280_BC283_FN0001"/></p>         </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
