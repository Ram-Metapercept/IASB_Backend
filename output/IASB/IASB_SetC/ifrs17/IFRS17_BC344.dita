When insurance revenue is measured in any other way, the incurred claims must be reconciled to the amount of expenses that is presented in the period. This is because both insurance revenue and incurred claims and benefits are measures of changes in the liability for the group of insurance contracts relating to coverage in the period.</p></body></paragraph>
