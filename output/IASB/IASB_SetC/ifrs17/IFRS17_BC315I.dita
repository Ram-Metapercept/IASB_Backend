The Board&#x2019;s decision to specify that an entity use a       systematic and rational method of allocation in the specific circumstance described in       paragraph BC315H was driven by the need to avoid the potential misinterpretation described in       that paragraph. The need for such specification in this case does not imply that an entity       cannot use a systematic and rational method of allocation in circumstances when it is not       specified in the requirements of IFRS 17.</p></body></paragraph>
