However, the Board concluded that some potentially appropriate approaches, such as some projected crediting methods, could not be described as cost measurements. Instead, the Board decided to set an objective for disaggregating the insurance finance income or expenses of a systematic allocation based on the characteristics of the insurance contracts. The Board considered whether this disaggregation objective alone would be sufficient, given the variety of contracts and the need to tailor more specific requirements to the features of different contracts. However, the Board concluded that a lack of prescribed methods might result in a lack of comparable information. Therefore the Board set out constraints on how a systematic allocation should be determined in <xref id="IFRS17_X1430" base="F59357810" href="IFRS17_B130.dita#IFRS17_B130">paragraphs B130&#x2013;B133 of IFRS 17</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
