In the fair value approach, an entity is permitted a choice to group together contracts that were issued more than one year apart. Some stakeholders suggested the Board provide further relief by permitting an entity a choice to group together contracts issued more than one year apart in a fully retrospective approach and in the modified retrospective approach, regardless of whether the entity has reasonable and supportable information to apply the annual cohort requirement. The Board disagreed with the suggestion for such transition relief because permitting an entity not to apply the annual cohort requirement:</p><ol><li><li_value>(a)</li_value><p>when the entity has the information available to apply a fully retrospective approach would have the effect that the entity would not be applying a fully retrospective approach; and</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value><p>when the entity has reasonable and supportable information to apply that requirement in the modified retrospective approach would be inconsistent with the objective of the modified retrospective approach.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
