The objective is to achieve the closest outcome to retrospective application possible using reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost or effort. The suggestion would also reduce comparability between contracts issued before and after the transition date.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value><p>with regards to the suggestion in paragraph BC380A(b), permitting an entity to apply a modification when it does not have reasonable and supportable information to do so would undermine the credibility of information that results from applying IFRS 17. In the Board&#x2019;s view, applying a fair value approach would result in more useful information for users of financial statements than would applying a modified retrospective approach without the reasonable and supportable information necessary to do so.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
