Preparers have to determine the category in which their insurance contracts belong, and users need to understand the implications of the different accounting requirements. The Board noted that the measurement of the fulfilment cash flows is the same for both types of contract, and the differences are limited to the treatment of the contractual service margin. The Board was persuaded that those differences are necessary to provide a faithful representation of the different nature of the types of contract.</p></body></paragraph>
