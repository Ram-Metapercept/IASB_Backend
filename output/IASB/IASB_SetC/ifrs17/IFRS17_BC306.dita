A reinsurance contract held typically protects the entity from the effects of some defined losses on the underlying group of insurance contracts, but does not eliminate the entity&#x2019;s responsibility for fulfilling its obligations under those contracts. It follows that the entity typically would not derecognise the related underlying insurance contracts upon entering into a reinsurance contract.</p></body></paragraph>
