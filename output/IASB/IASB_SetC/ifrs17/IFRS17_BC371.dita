Such disclosures might be useful for all entities operating in a regulated environment. The Board was concerned about developing such disclosures in isolation in a project on accounting for insurance contracts that would go beyond the existing requirements in <xref id="IFRS17_X1864" base="F59415700" href="../ias01/IAS01_g134-136.dita#IAS01_g134-136/IAS01_g134-136_TI">paragraphs 134&#x2013;136 of IAS 1</xref>. Accordingly, the Board decided to limit the disclosures about regulation to those set out in <xref id="IFRS17_X1865" base="F59415701" href="IFRS17_126.dita#IFRS17_126">paragraph 126 of IFRS 17</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
