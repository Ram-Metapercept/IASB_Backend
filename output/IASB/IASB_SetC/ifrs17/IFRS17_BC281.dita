The approach would have constrained the cumulative amount of the contractual service margin that the entity recognised in profit or loss to the amount to which the entity is reasonably assured to be entitled. However, in the Board&#x2019;s view, it would be inconsistent with other aspects of IFRS 17 to constrain the amount of contractual service margin on a &#x2018;reasonably assured&#x2019; basis. IFRS 17 requires a current measurement model based on a probability-weighted average of all possible scenarios and the contractual service margin depicts a current view of the unearned profit relating to services consistent with that measurement model.</p></body></paragraph>
