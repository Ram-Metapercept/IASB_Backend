However, the Board noted that:</p><ol id="IFRS17_L0424" base="F55750893" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS17_P5796" base="F55750894">although some regulatory requirements require current market-consistent measurement of future cash flows, their focus is on solvency, and they do not consider reporting of financial performance. Hence, for example, the measurement required by Solvency II, a regulation adopted by the European Union, is broadly consistent with the measurement of the fulfilment cash flows required by IFRS 17. However, Solvency II does not consider the determination or reporting of an entity&#x2019;s financial performance over time, which under IFRS 17 is achieved through the contractual service margin.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS17_P5797" base="F55750896">regulatory requirements may include simplifications and practical expedients that are appropriate in the context of the regulatory regime in which they were developed, but which may not be appropriate in an international financial reporting environment.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS17_P5798" base="F55750898">regulatory reporting frequently includes jurisdiction&#x2011;specific requirements, which accommodate issues specific to that jurisdiction, including policy objectives.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
