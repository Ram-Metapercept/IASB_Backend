Hence, both the change in the carrying amount of fulfilment cash flows and the change in the value of the derivative will be recognised in the statement(s) of financial performance. If the entity chooses to recognise all insurance finance income or expenses in profit or loss, there will be no accounting mismatch between the recognition of the change in the value of the derivative and the recognition of the change in the carrying amount of the insurance contract.</p></body></paragraph>
