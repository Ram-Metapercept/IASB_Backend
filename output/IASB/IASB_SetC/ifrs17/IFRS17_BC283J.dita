Applying this suggestion, an entity would decide what services are provided by the contract, potentially including services other than insurance coverage or services related to investment returns. The Board concluded that specifying that an entity recognises the contractual service margin by considering all services would result in more subjectivity and complexity than entities already face when determining the pattern of service provision. Feedback the Board received when developing IFRS 17 supports that view. Furthermore, the Board noted that the concerns leading to this suggestion were generally about services related to investment returns. The Board concluded that the amendment described in paragraph BC283A(a) responds to feedback that some insurance contracts without direct participation features have two defining services&#x2014;insurance coverage and investment-return service. Thus, the amendment balances the need for relevant information about the way in which profit from the contract is earned and the need for comparable information, as well as the costs of applying the coverage units requirement.</p></body></paragraph>
