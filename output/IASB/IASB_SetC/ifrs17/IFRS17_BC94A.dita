In June 2020, the Board amended IFRS 17 to exclude from the scope of the Standard such contracts if, and only if, an entity does not reflect an assessment of the insurance risk associated with an individual customer in setting the price of the contract with that customer. When the entity does not reflect such an assessment in the price of the contract, the Board concluded that IFRSâ€€9 would provide more useful information about those contracts than would IFRS 17.</p></body></paragraph>
