To avoid a significant loss of useful information for users       of financial statements, an entity is required to consistently apply its choice to all groups       of insurance contracts it issues and groups of reinsurance contracts it holds (that is, the       accounting policy choice is at the reporting entity level).</p></body></paragraph>
