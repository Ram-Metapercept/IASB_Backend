The Board noted that for a contract to meet the definition of an insurance contract from the perspective of the acquirer at the acquisition date, the acquirer must compensate the policyholder for the adverse effect of an uncertain future event (that is, the acquirer must provide insurance coverage). If the acquirer provides insurance coverage, the contract is an insurance contract accounted for applying the requirements of IFRSâ€¯17. Contracts acquired in their settlement period with claim amounts that are uncertain in timing or amount could meet the definition of an insurance contract at the acquisition date.</p></body></paragraph>
