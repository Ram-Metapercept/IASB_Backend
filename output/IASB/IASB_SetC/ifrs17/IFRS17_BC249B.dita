The additional adjustments to the contractual service margin in the variable fee approach were designed specifically to faithfully represent the profit from insurance contracts within the scope of the variable fee approach. Therefore, if the Board were to amend the scope of the variable fee approach, it would need to consider amending those adjustments. The Board also observed that whatever the scope of the variable fee approach, differences would arise between the accounting for contracts within the scope and contracts outside the scope.</p></body></paragraph>
