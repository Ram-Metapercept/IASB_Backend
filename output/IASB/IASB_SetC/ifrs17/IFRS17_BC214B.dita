Transition Resource Group members held different views. Some members thought the risk adjustment for non-financial risk for a group of insurance contracts must be the same in the issuing subsidiary&#x2019;s stand-alone financial statements as in the consolidated financial statements of the group of entities. Other members thought the risk adjustment for non-financial risk may be measured differently in the issuing subsidiary&#x2019;s stand-alone financial statements from how it is measured in the consolidated financial statements of the group of entities.</p></body></paragraph>
