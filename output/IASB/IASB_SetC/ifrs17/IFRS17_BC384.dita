This information would be particularly difficult to determine if, consistent with <xref id="IFRS17_X1883" base="F59415799" href="IFRS17_C10.dita#IFRS17_C10">paragraph C10 of IFRS 17</xref>, the entity included within a group insurance contracts issued more than one year apart. Accordingly, the Board decided to provide modifications that would enable an entity to determine those amounts at the transition date.</p></body></paragraph>
