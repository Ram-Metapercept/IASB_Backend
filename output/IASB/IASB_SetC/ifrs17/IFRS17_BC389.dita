However, the Board noted that different circumstances applied when it developed the transition requirements for IFRS 9, which were developed with the intention of minimising obstacles to voluntary application of IFRS 9 before its effective date. In addition, entities applying those transition requirements of IFRS 9 had all previously applied the same requirements, ie those in <xref base="F59415845" href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001/IAS39_TOC0001_V3" id="IFRS17_X1890">IAS 39</xref>. In contrast, the Board expects that most entities will apply IFRS 17 no earlier than the effective date and believes that the restatement of comparative amounts is particularly important, for the reasons given in <xref base="F59415846" href="IFRS17_BC388.dita#IFRS17_BC388" id="IFRS17_X1891">paragraph BC388</xref>. Therefore, the Board decided not to provide relief from the restatement of comparative information to facilitate early application of IFRS 17.</p></body></paragraph>
