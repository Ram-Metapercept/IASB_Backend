This measurement reflects the investment-related nature of         the contracts. Applying IFRS Standards, many underlying items will also be measured at fair         value. The Board also decided to amend some IFRS Standards to enable additional underlying         items to be measured at fair value (see <xref id="IFRS17_X1444" base="F59357866" href="IFRS17_BC65.dita#IFRS17_BC65">paragraph BC65(c)</xref>). However, there could still         be underlying items that cannot be measured at fair value applying IFRS Standards; for         example, other insurance contracts or net assets of a subsidiary. The Board noted that all         such mismatches would be eliminated only if all assets and liabilities were recognised and         measured at fair value.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
