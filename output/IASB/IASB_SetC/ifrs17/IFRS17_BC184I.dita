The asset was typically of relatively short duration and any lack of recoverability would be reflected on a timely basis when the asset was derecognised and the insurance acquisition cash flows were included in the measurement of a group of insurance contracts (see paragraph BC180). As a result of the June 2020 amendment set out in paragraph BC184A, the Board concluded that it needed to require an entity to assess the recoverability of an asset for insurance acquisition cash flows at the end of each reporting period if facts and circumstances indicate the asset may be impaired.</p></body></paragraph>
