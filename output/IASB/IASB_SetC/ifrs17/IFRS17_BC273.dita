The Board also decided, for the sake of simplicity, that the rate should be a rate applicable to nominal cash flows that do not vary based on asset returns. Locking in the rate is consistent with the determination of the contractual service margin on initial recognition and making no adjustments for changes in assumptions relating to financial risk.</p></body></paragraph>
