Applying IFRS 4, some entities presented separately in the statement of financial position different amounts arising from an insurance contract, as if those different amounts were separate assets or liabilities. For example, some entities presented an insurance contract liability and line items labelled as premiums receivable, claims payable and deferred acquisition costs. Entities differed in what line items they presented and in the definitions of those line items. For example, some entities presented amounts that were not yet billed as premiums receivable whereas other entities presented only billed amounts that remain outstanding. Some stakeholders said they would like to continue further disaggregation because they view such disaggregated line items as providing meaningful information to users of financial statements. The Board disagreed with suggestions to permit an entity to continue such disaggregation because it could result in the presentation of amounts that are not separable assets or liabilities. For example, premiums receivable for future insurance coverage is not a gross asset separable from the related liability for the future insurance coverage.</p></body></paragraph>
