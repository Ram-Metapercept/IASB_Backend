However, a fundamental aspect of much insurance activity is that the entity issues a large number of similar contracts knowing that some will result in claims and others will not. The large number of contracts reduces the risk that the outcome across all the contracts will differ from that expected by the entity. This aspect of insurance activity, combined with the requirements of IFRS 17 that require different timing of recognition of gains and losses (for example losses on onerous contracts are recognised earlier than gains on profitable contracts), means that the level of aggregation at which contracts are recognised and measured is an important factor in the representation of an entity&#x2019;s financial performance.</p></body></paragraph>
