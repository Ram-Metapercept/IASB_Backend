IFRS 17 requires an entity to distinguish between the effect of changes in assumptions that relate to financial risks (which do not adjust the contractual service margin) and the effect of changes in discretion (which do adjust the contractual service margin). The Board noted that there are potentially many ways in which an entity could make that distinction. To ensure a consistent approach, the Board decided to require an entity to specify at the inception of a contract the basis on which it expects to determine its commitment under the contract, for example, based on a fixed interest rate, or on returns that vary based on specified asset returns.</p></body></paragraph>
