In the Board&#x2019;s view, requiring an entity to determine discount rates using a rule-based approach would result in outcomes that are appropriate only in some circumstances. IFRSâ€¯17 requires entities to apply judgement when determining the inputs most applicable in the circumstances. To enable users of financial statements to understand the discount rates used, and to facilitate comparability between entities, IFRS 17 requires entities to disclose information about the methods used and judgements applied.</p></body></paragraph>
