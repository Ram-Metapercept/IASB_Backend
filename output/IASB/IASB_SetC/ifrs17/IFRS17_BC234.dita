In some such cases, the experience adjustment and the change in the estimates of the future cash flows largely offset and adjusting the contractual service margin for only one effect might not seem an appropriate depiction of the single event. However, in other cases, the experience adjustment and the change in the estimates of the future cash flows do not offset each other and recognising the experience adjustment in profit or loss in the current period while adjusting the contractual service margin for the change in the estimates of the future cash flows appropriately depicts both effects. The Board concluded that not establishing any further exceptions to the general rule described in <xref id="IFRS17_X1697" base="F59385089" href="IFRS17_BC233.dita#IFRS17_BC233">paragraph BC233</xref> gave an appropriate result in most cases and avoided excessively complex requirements.</p></body></paragraph>
