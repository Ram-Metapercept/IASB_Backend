These       stakeholders suggested the Board amend <xref href="../ifrs07/IFRS07_TOC.dita">IFRS 7</xref> to       require such disclosures as at the date the classification overlay is first applied (that is,       the transition date to IFRS 17) instead of as at the date of initial application of IFRS 9.       The Board noted that the classification overlay is an option that only some entities will       choose to use and is available on an instrument-by-instrument basis. In the Board&#x2019;s view,       applying the classification overlay is not equivalent to&#x2014;or a substitute for&#x2014;the initial       application of IFRS 9, hence disclosures about the classification overlay cannot replace       disclosures about the initial application of IFRS 9. The disclosures about the initial       application of IFRS 9 provide users of financial statements with comparable information about       the effects of applying IFRS 9 because all entities are required to provide those disclosures       as at the date of initial application of IFRS 9.</p></body></paragraph>
