Consequently, differences between the ultimate outcome and the previous estimate of expected value are not &#x2018;errors&#x2019; or &#x2018;failures&#x2019;. The expected value is a summary that incorporates all foreseeable outcomes. When one or more of those outcomes do not occur, that does not invalidate the previous estimate of the expected value.</p></body></paragraph>
