Doing so would be consistent with the aspects of IFRS 17 that focus on measuring the obligations accepted by the entity. However, such an approach would differ from that required for revenue contracts within the <xref base="F61090948" href="../ifrs15/IFRS15_g5-8.dita#IFRS15_g5-8/IFRS15_g5-8_TI" id="IFRS17_X1575">scope of IFRS 15</xref>, which focuses on measuring performance. Under <xref base="F61090949" href="../ifrs14/IFRS15_TOC.dita#IFRS15_TOC0001/IFRS15_TOC0001_V2" id="IFRS17_X1576">IFRS 15</xref>, an entity recognises no rights or obligations until one party has performed under the contract. That model would be consistent with the aspects of IFRS 17 that focus on measuring performance.</p></body></paragraph>
