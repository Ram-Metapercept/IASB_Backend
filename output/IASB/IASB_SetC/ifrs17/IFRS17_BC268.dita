Comparability across entities is enhanced if economically similar products         are accounted for in a similar way regardless of the legal form of the entity holding or         issuing the product. In addition, the Board noted that applying the mirroring approach would         mean that part of the fulfilment cash flows of an insurer that is a mutual entity would not         be measured at current value, which was a major concern about the mirroring approach for         some regulators (see <xref id="IFRS17_X1713" base="F61090484" href="IFRS17_BC262.dita#IFRS17_BC262">paragraph BC262</xref>). Hence, the Board concluded         that it should not retain the mirroring approach for insurers that are mutual entities.<xref type="fn" keyref="footnotes/IFRS17_BC265-BC269_FN0001"/></p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
