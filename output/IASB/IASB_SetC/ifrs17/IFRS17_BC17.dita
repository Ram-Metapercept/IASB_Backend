Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (see <xref base="F59357555" href="../ifrs13/IFRS13_TOC.dita#IFRS13_TOC0001/IFRS13_TOC0001_V2" id="IFRS17_X1379">IFRS 13 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Fair Value Measurement</ph></ph></xref>). However, many stakeholders suggested that such an approach places too much emphasis on hypothetical transactions that rarely happen. Therefore, IFRS 17 requires an entity to measure insurance contracts in a way that reflects the fact that entities generally fulfil insurance contracts directly over time by providing services to policyholders, rather than by transferring the contracts to a third party.</p></body></paragraph>
