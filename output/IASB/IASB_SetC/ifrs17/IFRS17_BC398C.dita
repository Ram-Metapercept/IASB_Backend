In June 2020, the Board amended IFRS 9 to provide transition requirements for such entities that apply paragraph 8A of IFRS 17 and choose to apply IFRS 9 to insurance contracts that limit the compensation for insured events to the amount otherwise required to settle the policyholder&#x2019;s obligation created by the contract (see paragraphs BC94D&#x2012;BC94F). The amendment enables those entities to use the transition requirements in Sectionâ€¯7.2 of IFRS 9 (as issued in 2014) when first applying IFRS 9 to those contracts.</p></body></paragraph>
