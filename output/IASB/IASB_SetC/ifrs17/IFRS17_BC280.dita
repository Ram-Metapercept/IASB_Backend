For such         contracts, IFRS 17 requires the contractual service margin to be determined based on the         total expected fee over the duration of the contracts, including expectations of an increase         in the fee because of an increase in underlying items arising from investment returns and         additional policyholder contributions over time. The Board rejected the view that the         allocation based on coverage units results in premature profit recognition. The Board noted         that the investment component of such contracts is accounted for as part of the insurance         contract only when the cash flows from the investment component and from insurance and other         services are highly interrelated and hence cannot be accounted for as distinct components.         In such circumstances, the entity provides multiple services in return for an expected fee         based on the expected duration of contracts, and the Board concluded the entity should         recognise that fee over the coverage period as the insurance services are provided, not when         the returns on the underlying items occur.<xref type="fn" keyref="footnotes/IFRS17_BC279_BC280_BC283_FN0001"/></p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
