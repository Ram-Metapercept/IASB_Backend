The Board concluded that it is unnecessary to amend IFRS 17 to reflect such circumstances. The Board reaffirmed its view that the requirements specify the amounts to be reported, not the methodology to be used to arrive at those amounts (see paragraph BC138). An entity is required to apply judgement and to consider all possible scenarios for future changes in expectations to conclude whether it could achieve the same accounting outcome without applying the annual cohort requirement.</p></body></paragraph>
