The Board decided that entities should not be required to disclose, for the current period and for each prior period presented, the amount of the adjustment for each financial statement line item affected, as required by <xref base="F59415921" href="../ias08/IAS08_g28-31.dita#IAS08_g28-31/IAS08_g28-31_TI" id="IFRS17_X1908">paragraph 28(f) of IAS 8</xref>. In the Board&#x2019;s view, the cost of providing this disclosure, which would include the running of parallel systems, would exceed the benefits, particularly because IFRS 4 permitted an entity to use a wide range of practices.</p></body></paragraph>
