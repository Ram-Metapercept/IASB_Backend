The only way of completely eliminating such accounting mismatches for all insurance contracts would be to measure both the insurance contracts and the assets using the same measure of current value and to include all finance income or expenses in profit or loss. The Board rejected such an approach for the reasons set out in <xref id="IFRS17_X1431" base="F59357811" href="IFRS17_gBC340-BC346.dita#IFRS17_gBC340-BC346/IFRS17_gBC340-BC346_TI">paragraph BC340</xref>. However, for insurance contracts for which there can be no economic mismatch with the assets held, it is possible to eliminate accounting mismatches between the insurance contracts and the assets in a different way, by using the current period book yield. The current period book yield is the change in the carrying amount of assets regarded as backing the insurance contracts, recognised in profit or loss for the period. The Board concluded that this approach is appropriate only for groups of insurance contracts for which there can be no economic mismatch with the assets held; ie groups of insurance contracts with direct participation features as defined in IFRS 17 if the entity holds the underlying items. The Board concluded this approach is inappropriate for other insurance contracts for the reasons set out in <xref id="IFRS17_X1432" base="F59357812" href="IFRS17_BC342.dita#IFRS17_BC342">paragraph BC342</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
