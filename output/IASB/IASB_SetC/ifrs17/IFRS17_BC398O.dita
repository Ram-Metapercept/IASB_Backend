For       example, <xref href="../ias01/IAS01_TOC.dita">IAS 1</xref> requires entities to disclose       material accounting policy information (see <xref href="../ias01/IAS01_g117-124.dita">paragraphs 117&#x2013;122 of IAS 1</xref>) and provide additional disclosures when compliance with       the specific requirements in IFRS Standards is insufficient to enable users of financial       statements to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on       the entity&#x2019;s financial position and financial performance (see <xref href="../ias01/IAS01_31.dita">paragraph 31 of IAS 1</xref>). Furthermore, in presenting       comparative information as required by IAS 1 for the amounts reported in the current period&#x2019;s       financial statements (which include the notes), an entity also provides narrative descriptions       or disaggregations of the comparative information to support information for items presented       in the primary financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
