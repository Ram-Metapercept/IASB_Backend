This is the case even if the payments to policyholders vary with returns on underlying items through a participation mechanism, for the reasons set out in <xref id="IFRS17_X1694" base="F59385086" href="IFRS17_BC229.dita#IFRS17_BC229">paragraphs BC229&#x2013;BC231</xref>. Accordingly, the entity does not adjust the contractual service margin to reflect the effects of changes in these assumptions.</p></body></paragraph>
