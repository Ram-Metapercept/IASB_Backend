That amendment adds complexity and judgement to the determination of the quantity of benefits       provided by an insurance contract for the purpose of recognising the contractual service       margin in profit or loss. Accordingly, the Board decided to require an entity to disclose:</p><ol><li><li_value>(a)</li_value><p>quantitative information, in appropriate time bands, about when the entity expects to recognise in profit or loss the contractual service margin remaining at the end of the reporting period (instead of permitting an entity to provide only qualitative information); and</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value><p>the approach used to assess the relative weighting of the benefits from insurance coverage and either investment-return service or investment-related service.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
