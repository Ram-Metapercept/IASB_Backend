The contract, when considered as a whole, clearly meets the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph>&#x2019;s definition of a liability. Some components, if viewed in isolation, may not meet the definition of a liability. However, in the Board&#x2019;s view, including such components in the measurement of insurance contracts would generate more useful information for users of financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
