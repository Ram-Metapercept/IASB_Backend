Although the usefulness of the confidence level technique diminishes when the probability distribution is not statistically normal, which is often the case for insurance contracts, the cost of capital approach would be more complicated to calculate than would the confidence level disclosure. Also, the confidence level technique has the benefit of being relatively easy to communicate to users of financial statements and relatively easy to understand. The Board expects that many entities will have the information necessary to apply the cost of capital technique because that information will be required to comply with local regulatory requirements. However, the Board decided not to impose the more onerous requirements on entities when a simpler approach would be sufficient.</p></body></paragraph>
