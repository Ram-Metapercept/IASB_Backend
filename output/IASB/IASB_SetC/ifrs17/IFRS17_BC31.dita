In the view of some, users of financial statements do not typically compare the results of entities that issue insurance contracts with those of other entities. Instead, they argue that many users of financial statements that specialise in the insurance sector rely on the disaggregated information in the notes to the financial statements. Therefore, those who held this view expected users of financial statements to derive little value from the information reported in the statement(s) of financial performance because:</p><ol id="IFRS17_L0437" base="F55751000" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS17_P5844" base="F55751001">the accounting models for life insurance contracts, unlike those for other transactions, typically measure the profit from insurance contracts directly through the changes in the insurance contract liability. In contrast, the profit from other transactions is measured as the difference between revenue and expenses.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS17_P5845" base="F55751003">measures of total premiums that include both revenue and investment components are considered by some to be the most meaningful measure of gross performance and growth for insurance contracts. Such measures give information about the total increase in assets under management. However, those with this view accept that this measure is inconsistent with usual concepts of revenue and therefore accept that this information should not be presented in the statement(s) of financial performance. Applying IFRS 17, this would instead be reported in the notes to the financial statements and elsewhere.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
