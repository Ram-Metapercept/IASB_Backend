The Board therefore decided not to reduce the options available in the transition requirements, because doing so would be likely to cause undue disruption to implementation already under way. The Board noted the reduced comparability that the transition options cause has no effect on the current value measurement of the fulfilment cash flows. The Board also noted that entities are required to provide disclosures on the transition approaches used. Such disclosures assist users of financial statements in making comparisons between entities, and in understanding the transition reliefs used and how those reliefs affect reported information.</p></body></paragraph>
