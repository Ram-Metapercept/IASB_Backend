<paragraph id="IFRS17_BC80" base="F55751265"><paranum>BC80</paranum><prolog><data name="standard_number" value="IFRS 17"/><data name="paranum" value="BC80"/></prolog><body><p id="IFRS17_P5942">The Board also rejected the notion of defining the significance of insurance risk by expressing the expected (ie probability-weighted) average of the present values of the adverse outcomes as a proportion of the expected present value of all outcomes, or as a proportion of the premium. This notion had some intuitive appeal because it would include both amount and probability. However, such a definition would have meant that a contract could start as a financial liability and become an insurance contract as time passes or probabilities are reassessed. In the Board&#x2019;s view, it would be too burdensome to require an entity to continuously monitor whether a contract meets the definition of an insurance contract over its duration. Instead, the Board adopted an approach that requires the decision about whether a contract is an insurance contract to be made once only, at contract inception (unless the terms of the contract are modified). The requirements in <xref id="IFRS17_X1486" base="F59367582" href="IFRS17_B18.dita#IFRS17_B18">paragraphs B18&#x2013;B24 of IFRS 17</xref> focus on whether insured events could cause an entity to pay additional amounts, judged on a contract-by-contract basis. Further, <xref id="IFRS17_X1487" base="F59367583" href="IFRS17_B25.dita#IFRS17_B25">paragraph B25 of IFRS 17</xref> states that an insurance contract remains an insurance contract until all rights and obligations expire.</p></body></paragraph>
