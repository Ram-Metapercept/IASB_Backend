This suggestion would have removed the requirement to group separately insurance contracts that at initial recognition have no significant possibility of becoming onerous from other insurance contracts that are not onerous at initial recognition. The Board noted that an entity will generally issue contracts expecting them to be profitable, and losses will arise subsequently as a result of changes in expectations. Including all contracts that are profitable at initial recognition in a single group could significantly delay loss recognition or increase the risk of losses for onerous contracts never being recognised.</p></body></paragraph>
