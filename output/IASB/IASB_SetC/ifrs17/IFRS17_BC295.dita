However, both preparers and users of financial statements expressed the view that using the discount rate at the date the claim was incurred would be less complex than using the rate at the inception of the contract. The liability for incurred claims is zero when the group of insurance contracts is initially recognised and the entity may not have determined a discount rate at that time. The Board concluded that the premium allocation approach, which was developed as a simplification, should not burden entities by creating high costs and operational complexity. Consequently, IFRS 17 requires that entities measure the interest expense for the liability for incurred claims using the rate that applied when the liability for incurred claims was initially recognised, rather than when the group of insurance contracts was initially recognised.</p></body></paragraph>
