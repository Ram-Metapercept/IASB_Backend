This method of recognising the contractual service margin also may add complexity for users of financial statements because of the need to understand the amounts recognised in the statement of financial position and in the statement(s) of financial performance. However, the Board concluded that recognition of the profit in the group of insurance contracts over the coverage period is necessary to represent faithfully an entity&#x2019;s financial performance over the coverage period.</p></body></paragraph>
