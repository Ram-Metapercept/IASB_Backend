It also increases comparability among entities that issue insurance contracts. Both this approach and the simpler premium allocation approach (see <xref id="IFRS17_X1411" base="F59357710" href="IFRS17_gBC288-BC295.dita#IFRS17_gBC288-BC295/IFRS17_gBC288-BC295_TI">paragraphs BC288&#x2013;BC295</xref>) allocate customer consideration in a way that reflects the transfer of services provided under the contract. As a result, the insurance revenue presented for contracts accounted for using the general requirements in IFRS 17 can be meaningfully combined with the insurance revenue for contracts accounted for using the premium allocation approach. Many users of financial statements use measures of revenue to provide information about the volume of business and gross performance.</p></body></paragraph>
