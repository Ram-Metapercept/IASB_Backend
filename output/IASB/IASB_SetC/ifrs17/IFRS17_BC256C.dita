The Board was persuaded that if such non-derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value through profit or loss, an accounting mismatch could arise, which is similar to the accounting mismatch for derivatives (see paragraph BC252). Accordingly, the Board extended the risk mitigation option to apply in such circumstances. The Board decided to limit the extension to only non-derivative financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss. For such non-derivative financial instruments, the extension resolves the accounting mismatch in the same way it resolves the accounting mismatch for derivatives (which are also measured at fair value through profit or loss).</p></body></paragraph>
