IFRS 17 also requires an entity to update the measurement of the contractual         service margin for changes in estimates of the fulfilment cash flows relating to future         service, for the following reasons:</p>       <ol id="IFRS17_L0502" base="F55753337" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>           <p id="IFRS17_P6223" base="F55753338">changes in estimates of the fulfilment cash flows             relating to future service affect the future profitability of the group of insurance             contracts. Thus, adjusting the contractual service margin to reflect these changes             provides more relevant information about the remaining unearned profit in the group of             insurance contracts after initial recognition than not adjusting the contractual service             margin. <xref id="IFRS17_X1686" base="F59385001" href="IFRS17_gBC227-BC237.dita#IFRS17_gBC227-BC237/IFRS17_gBC227-BC237_TI">Paragraphs               BC227&#x2013;BC237</xref> discuss which changes in estimates relate to future service             for insurance contracts without direct participation features, and <xref id="IFRS17_X1687" base="F59385002" href="IFRS17_gBC238-BC269.dita#IFRS17_gBC238-BC269/IFRS17_gBC238-BC269_TI">paragraphs               BC238&#x2013;BC256H</xref> discuss which changes relate to future service for             insurance contracts with direct participation features.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>           <p id="IFRS17_P6224" base="F55753340">increased consistency between measurement at initial             recognition and subsequent measurement. If the contractual service margin were not             adjusted for changes in estimates relating to future service, the estimates made at             initial recognition would determine the contractual service margin, but changes in those             estimates thereafter would not.</p></li></ol>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
