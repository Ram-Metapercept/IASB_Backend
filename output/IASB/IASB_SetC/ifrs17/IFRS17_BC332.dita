This approach would have         applied to most insurance contracts with a coverage period of more than one year. The         summarised-margin approach would have been operationally less complex than any presentation         that provides a gross performance measure in profit or loss. This is because the         summarised-margin approach would not have distinguished between investment components and         premiums for services provided. Further, the Board would not have needed an exception for         the treatment of insurance acquisition cash flows (see <xref id="IFRS17_X1779" base="F59408340" href="IFRS17_gBC175-BC184.dita#IFRS17_gBC175-BC184/IFRS17_gBC175-BC184_TI">paragraphs           BC175&#x2013;BC180</xref>) to avoid a situation in which an entity recognises insurance         revenue before the coverage has been provided.<xref type="fn" keyref="footnotes/IFRS17_BC332_FN0001"/></p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
