Such         models treat insurance acquisition cash flows as a representation of the cost of a         recognisable asset, which, depending on the model, might be described as a contract asset or         a customer relationship intangible asset. The Board concluded that such an asset either does         not exist, if the entity recovers insurance acquisition cash flows from premiums already         received, or relates to future cash flows that are included in the measurement of the           contract.<xref type="fn" keyref="footnotes/IFRS17_BC176_FN0001"/> The Board noted that an         entity typically charges the policyholder a price the entity regards as sufficient to         compensate it for undertaking the obligation to pay for insured losses and for the cost of         originating the contracts. Thus, a faithful representation of the remaining obligation to         pay for insured losses should not include the part of the premium intended to compensate for         the cost of originating the contracts.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
