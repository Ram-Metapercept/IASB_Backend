Such a requirement would contradict the principle that an entity should incorporate in the measurement of an insurance contract future cash flows on a probability-weighted basis. Consequently, IFRS 17 does not require or allow the application of a deposit floor when measuring insurance contracts. This applies both to the general measurement requirements of IFRS 17 and when IFRS 17 requires the use of fair value (see <xref id="IFRS17_X1621" base="F59369459" href="IFRS17_BC327.dita#IFRS17_BC327">paragraphs BC327</xref> and <xref id="IFRS17_X1622" base="F59369460" href="IFRS17_gBC385-BC386.dita#IFRS17_gBC385-BC386/IFRS17_gBC385-BC386_TI">BC385</xref>). However, <xref id="IFRS17_X1623" base="F59369461" href="IFRS17_g132-132.dita#IFRS17_g132-132/IFRS17_g132-132_TI">paragraph 132(c) of IFRS 17</xref> requires entities to disclose the amount payable on demand in a way that highlights the relationship between such amounts and the carrying amount of the related contracts.</p></body></paragraph>
