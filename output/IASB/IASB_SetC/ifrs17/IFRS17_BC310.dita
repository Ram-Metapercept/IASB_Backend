Thus, a debit contractual service margin, which represents the net expense of purchasing reinsurance, would typically be recognised on the initial recognition of a group of reinsurance contracts held. The Board considered whether the contractual service margin of the group of reinsurance contracts held could be a credit if, as happens in rare cases, the amount paid by the entity is less than the expected present value of cash flows plus the risk adjustment for non&#x2011;financial risk. Such a credit contractual service margin would represent a net gain on purchasing reinsurance. The most likely causes of such a net gain would be either of the following:</p><ol id="IFRS17_L0524" base="F55753605" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS17_P6368" base="F55753606">an overstatement of the underlying insurance contract(s).
