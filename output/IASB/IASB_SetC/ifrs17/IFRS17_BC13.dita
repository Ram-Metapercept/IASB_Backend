The Board rejected this suggestion because such an approach would be based on the type of entity issuing the contract and on numerous standards developed at different times. In addition, although US GAAP is widely used as a basis for accounting for insurance contracts, it was developed in the context of US insurance products and the US regulatory environment. Further, when IFRS 17 was developed, the US Financial Accounting Standards Board was working on a project to improve, simplify and enhance the financial reporting requirements for long-term insurance contracts issued by entities applying US GAAP.</p></body></paragraph>
