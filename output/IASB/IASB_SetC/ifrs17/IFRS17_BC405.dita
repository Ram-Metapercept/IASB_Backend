As a result, IFRS 4 would have permitted an entity to apply the requirements in IFRS 17, except for the requirements relating to other comprehensive income and transition relief. Accordingly, the Board concluded that it would be inappropriate to prohibit early application of IFRS 17.</p></body></paragraph>
