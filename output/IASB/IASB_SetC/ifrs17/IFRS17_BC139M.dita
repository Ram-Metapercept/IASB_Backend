For such contracts, an entity adjusts the contractual service margin for changes in the amount of the entity&#x2019;s share of the fair value of underlying items. IFRS 17 does not include specific requirements for allocating those changes between annual cohorts that share in the same pool of underlying items. The Board acknowledged that an entity needs to apply judgement to choose an allocation approach that provides useful information about the participation of each annual cohort in the underlying items.</p></body></paragraph>
