In June 2020, the Board also added a scope exclusion in paragraph 7(h) of IFRS 17 for some contracts that provide credit or payment arrangements such as particular credit card contracts (see paragraphs BC94A&#x2012;BC94C). Stakeholders said that, for such contracts, many entities already apply IFRS 9 to the credit or payment arrangement component applying the separation requirements in IFRS 4. However, some may not have. Accordingly, the transition requirements discussed in paragraphs BC398A&#x2012;BC398E will apply if an entity has already applied IFRS 9 but has not applied IFRS 9 to those components.</p></body></paragraph>
