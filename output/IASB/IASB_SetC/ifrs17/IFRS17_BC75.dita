Such a definition would have extended the meaning of the term &#x2018;insurance contract&#x2019; beyond its traditional meaning, which the Board did not want to do. The notion of insurable interest is also needed to avoid including gambling in the definition of insurance. Furthermore, it is a principle-based distinction, particularly between insurance contracts and contracts used for hedging.</p></body></paragraph>
