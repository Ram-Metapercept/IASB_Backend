Some stakeholders expressed the view that information about own credit risk relating to a liability that must be fulfilled by the issuer, and about gains and losses arising from changes in the issuer&#x2019;s own credit risk, is not relevant for users of financial statements. The Board concluded that including the effect of a change in the entity&#x2019;s own non-performance risk in the measurement of an insurance contract liability would not provide useful information. The Board considered concerns that excluding own credit risk could lead to accounting mismatches, because the fair value of the assets viewed as backing insurance contracts includes changes in credit risk on those assets, while the measurement of a group of insurance contracts would exclude changes in the credit risk of the group of contracts. In the Board&#x2019;s view, such mismatches will often be economic in nature, because the credit risk associated with the insurance contracts differs from the credit risk of the assets held by the entity.</p></body></paragraph>
