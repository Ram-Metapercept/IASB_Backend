An entity is not       required to apply the measurement requirements in those paragraphs to insurance contracts       acquired in a business combination outside the scope of IFRS 3 (that is, a business       combination under common control). The Board did not intend to set requirements for business       combinations outside the scope of IFRS 3. Such business combinations are the subject of a       separate Board project. </p></body></paragraph>
