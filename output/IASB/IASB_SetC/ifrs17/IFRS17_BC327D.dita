Differences in accounting between an       acquirer&#x2019;s financial statements and an acquiree&#x2019;s financial statements can arise because of       the requirements in IFRS 3. Such differences reflect changes in facts and circumstances at the       acquisition date compared to facts and circumstances at the date the acquiree recognised the       contracts. Such differences depict the economics of the acquisition, are not unique to       insurance contracts and are not unusual when applying IFRS Standards.</p></body></paragraph>
