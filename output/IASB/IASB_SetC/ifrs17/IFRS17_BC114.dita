Such components may have been separated when applying previous accounting practices. However, the Board concluded that it would not be possible to separate in a non-arbitrary way a component that is not distinct from the insurance contract nor would such a result be desirable. Permitting an entity to separate such components would mean that the entity measures the components in the contract on an arbitrary basis. The Board also noted that when separation ignores interdependencies between insurance and non-insurance components, the sum of the values of the components may not always equal the value of the contract as a whole, even on initial recognition. That would reduce the comparability of the financial statements across entities.</p></body></paragraph>
