Such presentation would provide disaggregated information about the effects of changes in insurance contract assets and liabilities in profit or loss. However, the Board rejected this approach for the same reasons given in <xref id="IFRS17_X1785" base="F59411074" href="IFRS17_gBC340-BC346.dita#IFRS17_gBC340-BC346/IFRS17_gBC340-BC346_TI">paragraph BC340</xref> and also because it would introduce operational complexity similar to that discussed in <xref id="IFRS17_X1786" base="F59411075" href="IFRS17_BC43.dita#IFRS17_BC43">paragraph BC43(b)(ii)</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
