The Board considered whether such changes should be recognised in profit or loss to the extent that they reverse previously recognised losses or whether the changes should adjust, or rebuild, the contractual service margin. In the 2013 Exposure Draft, the Board proposed that the changes adjust the contractual service margin, rather than being recognised in profit or loss, because of the complexity in assessing the extent to which the favourable changes reverse previous losses. However, some stakeholders stated that it would be counterintuitive to rebuild a contractual service margin for future profit from contracts that were considered loss-making overall.</p></body></paragraph>
