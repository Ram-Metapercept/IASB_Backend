If         both parties are bound equally, the boundary of the contract is generally clear. Similarly,         if neither party is bound, it is clear that no genuine contract exists. Thus:</p>       <ol id="IFRS17_L0481" base="F55751602" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>           <p id="IFRS17_P6102" base="F55751603">the outer limit of the existing contract is the             point at which the entity is no longer required to provide coverage and the policyholder             has no right of renewal. Beyond that outer limit, neither party is bound.<xref type="fn" keyref="footnotes/IFRS17_BC160_BC162_BC163_FN0001"/></p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>           <p id="IFRS17_P6103" base="F55751605">the entity is no longer bound by the existing             contract at the point at which the contract confers on the entity the practical ability             to reassess the risk presented by a policyholder and, as a result, the right to set a             price that fully reflects that risk. Thus, any cash flows arising beyond that point             occur beyond the boundary of the existing contract and relate to a future contract, not             to the existing contract.</p></li></ol>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
