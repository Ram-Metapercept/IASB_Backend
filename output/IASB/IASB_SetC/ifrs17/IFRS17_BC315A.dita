An entity determines the income on the reinsurance contract held (ie the amount of loss recovered) by multiplying:</p><ol><li><li_value>(a)</li_value><p>the loss recognised on the underlying insurance contracts; and</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value><p>the percentage of claims on underlying insurance contracts the entity expects to recover from the reinsurance contracts held.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
