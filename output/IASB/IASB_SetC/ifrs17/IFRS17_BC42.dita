Such income or expenses for a portfolio of insurance contracts is either all included in profit or loss or is disaggregated between profit or loss and other comprehensive income. If disaggregated, the amount in profit or loss is based on a systematic allocation of the expected total finance income or expenses over the duration of the groups of insurance contracts in the portfolio. The systematic allocation is based on the characteristics of the insurance contracts, without reference to factors that do not affect the cash flows expected to arise under the contracts. For example, the allocation of the insurance finance income or expenses should be based on expected recognised returns on assets only if those expected recognised returns affect the cash flows of the contracts. (In specific circumstances, an amount that eliminates accounting mismatches is included in profit or loss rather than an amount based on a systematic allocation (see <xref id="IFRS17_X1427" base="F59357807" href="IFRS17_BC48.dita#IFRS17_BC48">paragraph BC48</xref>)).</p></body></paragraph>
