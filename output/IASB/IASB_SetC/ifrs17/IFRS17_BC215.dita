This could result in entities determining different risk adjustments for non&#x2011;financial risk for similar groups of insurance contracts. Accordingly, to allow users of financial statements to understand how the entity-specific assessment of risk aversion might differ from entity to entity, IFRS 17 requires entities to disclose the confidence level to which the risk adjustment for non-financial risk corresponds.</p></body></paragraph>
