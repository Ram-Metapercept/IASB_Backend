Some argue that the measurement of insurance contracts should use a single estimate of the cash flows, for example, the most likely outcome or an outcome that is likely to prove &#x2018;sufficient&#x2019; at an implicit or explicit level of confidence. However, the Board decided that a measure of insurance contracts is most useful if it captures information about the full range of possible outcomes and their probabilities.</p></body></paragraph>
