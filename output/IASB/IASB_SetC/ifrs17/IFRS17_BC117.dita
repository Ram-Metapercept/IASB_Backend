The fulfilment cash flows include all changes in estimates, regardless of whether they are gains or losses or they relate to past, current or future service. Hence, IFRS 17 allows an entity to estimate the fulfilment cash flows at whatever level of aggregation is most appropriate from a practical perspective. All that is necessary is that the entity is able to allocate such estimates to groups of insurance contracts so that the resulting fulfilment cash flows of the group comply with requirements of IFRS 17.</p></body></paragraph>
