The application of IFRS 17 would not of itself have been likely to have resulted in a change in an entity&#x2019;s business model in accordance with IFRS 9. However, the Board acknowledged that there is a relationship between how entities manage their financial assets and their insurance contract liabilities. Therefore, to reduce the risk of accounting mismatches arising, the Board decided to allow an entity to reassess its business models on the initial application of IFRS 17 if they have previously applied IFRS 9.</p></body></paragraph>
