In particular situations, some techniques may be more applicable, or may be easier to implement, and it would not be practicable for an IFRS Standard to specify in detail every situation in which particular techniques would be appropriate. Furthermore, techniques may evolve over time. Specifying particular techniques might prevent an entity from improving its techniques.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p base="F55753306" id="IFRS17_P6207">the objective of the risk adjustment for non-financial risk is to reflect the entity&#x2019;s perception of the economic burden of its non-financial risks. Specifying a level of aggregation for determining the risk adjustment for non-financial risk that was inconsistent with the entity&#x2019;s view of the burden of non-financial risk would contradict the objective of reflecting the entity&#x2019;s perception in the risk adjustment for non&#x2011;financial risk.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
