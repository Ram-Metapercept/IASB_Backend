To prevent insurers that are         mutual entities from reporting negative equity, some stakeholders suggested that the         mirroring approach be retained for such entities to eliminate or reduce the effect of         accounting mismatches.<xref type="fn" keyref="footnotes/IFRS17_BC265-BC269_FN0001"/></p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
