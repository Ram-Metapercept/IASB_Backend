The entity may also apply the premium allocation approach if the coverage period of each reinsurance contract held in the group is one year or less. Because groups of reinsurance contracts are separate from the groups of underlying insurance contracts, the assessment of whether a group of reinsurance contracts meets conditions for applying the premium allocation approach may differ from the assessment of whether the group(s) of underlying insurance contracts meet(s) those conditions.</p></body></paragraph>
