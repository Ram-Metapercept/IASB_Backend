However, some entities implementing IFRS 17 as issued in May 2017 said that the requirement described in paragraph BC236 would result in a practical burden that would be more significant than the burden the Board had intended to alleviate. Some of those entities said that the requirement was a burden particularly for entities in a consolidated group that report at different frequencies from each other, because there would be a need to maintain two sets of records to reflect the different treatments of the accounting estimates.</p></body></paragraph>
