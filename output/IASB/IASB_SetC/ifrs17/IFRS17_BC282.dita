IFRS 17 does not specify whether an entity should consider the time value of money in determining that equal allocation and consequently does not specify whether that equal allocation should reflect the timing of the expected provision of the coverage units. The Board concluded that should be a matter of judgement by an entity.</p></body></paragraph>
