The Board agreed this         information would be useful to users of financial statements. IFRS 17 requires entities to         disclose when they expect to recognise the contractual service margin remaining at the end         of the reporting period in profit or loss, either quantitatively, in appropriate time bands,         or by providing qualitative information.<xref type="fn" keyref="footnotes/IFRS17_BC363_FN0001"/></p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
