Such cash flows include cash flows related to insurance contracts the entity expects to issue in the future if the entity has a substantive right to receive reinsurance coverage for those insurance contracts. The Board considered a suggestion from entities implementing IFRS 17 to amend IFRS 17 to exclude from the measurement of the group of reinsurance contracts held cash flows that relate to underlying insurance contracts that are yet to be issued.</p></body></paragraph>
