A replicating portfolio is a theoretical portfolio of assets providing cash flows that exactly match the cash flows from the liability in all scenarios. If such a portfolio exists, the appropriate discount rate(s) for the replicating portfolio would also be the appropriate discount rate(s) for the liability. If a replicating portfolio existed and could be measured directly, there would be no need to determine separately the cash flows and the discount rate for the part of the liability replicated by that portfolio. The measurements of the replicating portfolio and the replicated cash flows arising from the contracts would be identical.</p></body></paragraph>
