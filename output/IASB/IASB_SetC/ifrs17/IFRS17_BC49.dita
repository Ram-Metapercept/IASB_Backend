To achieve this outcome if an entity transfers a group of insurance contracts before the fulfilment of all the contracts in the group, IFRS 17 requires that the cumulative amount recognised in other comprehensive income by the date of the transfer should be reclassified to profit or loss at the date of the transfer. The Board considered whether the same requirement should apply to groups of insurance contracts to which the current period book yield applies. However, the Board noted that the cumulative amount recognised in other comprehensive income over the duration of a group that is not transferred will not necessarily equal zero under the current period book yield. The Board concluded that to achieve the objective of the current period book yield, which is to eliminate accounting mismatches between the insurance contracts and the assets held, no amounts should be reclassified from other comprehensive income to profit or loss on a transfer of a group beyond any such amounts arising because of the change in carrying amount of the assets recognised in profit or loss in the period of the transfer.</p></body></paragraph>
