An obligation is extinguished when it has expired or has been discharged or cancelled. However, in some cases, an entity may modify the terms of an existing contract in a way that would have significantly changed the accounting of the contract if the new terms had always existed. IFRS 17 specifies different requirements for these and other modifications. In some cases, insurance contract modifications will result in derecognising the insurance contract.</p></body></paragraph>
