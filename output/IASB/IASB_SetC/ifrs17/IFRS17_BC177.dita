IFRS 17 achieves this by requiring that the cash flows for a group of insurance         contracts include the insurance acquisition cash outflows or inflows associated with the         group of contracts (including amounts received or to be received by the entity to acquire         new insurance contracts).<xref type="fn" keyref="footnotes/IFRS17_BC177_FN0001"/> This         approach reduces the contractual service margin on initial recognition of the group of         insurance contracts and has the advantage that the insurance acquisition cash flows are         treated the same as other cash flows incurred in fulfilling contracts.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
