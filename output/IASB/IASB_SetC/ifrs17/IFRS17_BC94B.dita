For example, an entity applying IFRS 4 might have accounted for the credit card component applying IFRS 9, the insurance component applying IFRS 4 and any other service components applying IFRS 15. IFRS 17 has different criteria from IFRS 4 for separating components of an insurance contract. However, the Board acknowledged that entities had already identified methods to separate the components of the contracts described in paragraph BC94A, and concluded that prohibiting such separation would impose costs and disruption for no significant benefit.</p></body></paragraph>
