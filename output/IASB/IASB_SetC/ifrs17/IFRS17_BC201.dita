The objective of the discount rate is to adjust estimated future cash flows for the time value of money and for financial risks (for example, the liquidity risk), to the extent that they are not included in the estimated cash flows, in a way that captures the characteristics of the contract. To capture the characteristics of the contract:</p><ol id="IFRS17_L0493" base="F55751748" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS17_P6174" base="F55751749">to the extent that the cash flows from assets (or other underlying items) affect the cash flows that arise from the liability, the appropriate discount rate should reflect the dependence on the underlying items; and</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS17_P6175" base="F55751751">to the extent that the cash flows that arise from the contracts are expected not to vary with returns on underlying items, the appropriate discount rate should exclude any factors that influence the underlying items that are irrelevant to the contracts. Such factors include risks that are not present in the contracts but are present in the financial instrument for which the market prices are observed. Thus, the discount rate should not capture all of the characteristics of those assets, even if the entity views those assets as backing those contracts.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
