The Board therefore considered whether to amend the requirements, and if so, how (see paragraph BC139B). Having considered a number of possible amendments, the Board reaffirmed its view that the benefits of the level of aggregation requirements significantly outweigh the costs. The Board therefore decided to retain the requirements unchanged.</p></body></paragraph>
