It noted that, applying the classification overlay, the carrying amount of a       financial asset would be determined consistently with how that financial asset would be       measured on initial application of <xref href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_TOC.dita">IFRS 9</xref> (see       also <xref href="IFRS17_BC398M.dita">paragraph BC398M</xref>). If, for example, using the       classification overlay, an entity presented a financial asset previously measured at amortised       cost as instead measured at fair value through profit or loss, the carrying amount of that       asset at the transition date to IFRS 17 would be its fair value measured at that date.       Applying <xref href="IFRS17_C28D.dita">paragraph C28D of IFRS 17</xref>, any difference in the       carrying amount of the financial asset at the transition date resulting from applying the       classification overlay would be recognised in opening retained earnings (or other component of       equity, as appropriate) at that date.</p></body></paragraph>
