However, the Board disagreed with stakeholders who said that the rarity of such an event makes less useful the information that results from applying the annual cohort requirement to such insurance contracts. The Board instead observed the rarity makes the information particularly useful to users of financial statements when such an event occurs. The Board identified such information about the effect of financial guarantees as being particularly important when interest rates are low.</p></body></paragraph>
