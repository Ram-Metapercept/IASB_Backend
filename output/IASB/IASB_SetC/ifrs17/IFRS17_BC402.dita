However, in the case of major Standards, such as IFRS 17, that have a pervasive effect on entities, the Board has allowed longer implementation periods to allow entities time to resolve the operational challenges in implementing those Standards. At the same time, the Board needs to balance the advantage of a longer implementation period for preparers against the disadvantages of allowing inferior accounting practices, arising from IFRS 4, to continue.</p></body></paragraph>
