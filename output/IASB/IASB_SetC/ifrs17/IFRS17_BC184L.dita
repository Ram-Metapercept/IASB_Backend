Such assets and liabilities might have been recognised before the group of insurance contracts is recognised because the cash flows occur or because a liability is recognised applying another IFRS Standard. Cash flows are related to a group of insurance contracts if they would have been included in the fulfilment cash flows at the date of initial recognition of the group had they been paid or received after that date.</p></body></paragraph>
