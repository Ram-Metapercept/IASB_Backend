As a result, the contractual service margin for a group of insurance contracts recognised after the acquisition date will appropriately reflect the rights relating to that future group which the entity paid for as part of the consideration for the acquisition. The Board decided that to achieve consistency between the requirements at the acquisition date and after the acquisition date, an entity should determine the rights described in paragraph BC327H(b) by reference to insurance acquisition cash flows the acquiree has already paid. Otherwise, broader rights to obtain future contracts from intangible assets such as customer relationships, unconnected to any previously paid insurance acquisition cash flows, could be included in the assets for insurance acquisition cash flows and therefore subsequently included in the contractual service margin of future groups of insurance contracts. In contrast, the Board decided that such reference is unnecessary to determine the rights described in paragraph BC327H(a)&#x2014;these rights relate only to renewals, so they are sufficiently constrained.</p></body></paragraph>
