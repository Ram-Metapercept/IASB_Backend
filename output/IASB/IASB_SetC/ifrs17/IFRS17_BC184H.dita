The amendment will therefore increase the carrying amount of assets for insurance acquisition cash flows. Accordingly, the Board considered whether it should specify requirements for:</p><ol><li><li_value>(a)</li_value><p>accretion of interest on assets for insurance acquisition cash flows. The Board decided against specifying such requirements because doing so would be inconsistent with IFRSâ€¯15.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value><p>assessments of the recoverability of assets for insurance acquisition cash flows. The Board decided to specify such requirements for the reasons set out in paragraphs BC184I&#x2013;BC184K.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
