This approach would have allowed an entity to recognise in profit or loss the change in fair value of a hypothetical derivative that matches the critical terms of the specified fulfilment cash flows or the entity&#x2019;s share of the fair value return on the underlying items. This might have resulted in a greater reduction in accounting mismatches, because a fair value measurement would have been used in profit or loss for both the &#x2018;hedged&#x2019; fulfilment cash flows and the &#x2018;hedging&#x2019; derivative, relative to the measurement being used for the fulfilment cash flows under IFRS 17. However, the Board concluded that such an approach would involve too much additional complexity.</p></body></paragraph>
