Further, those amounts must be expected to include an investment return that the entity generates by performing investment activity. The Board concluded that if those conditions are not met, the policyholder has no right to benefit from investment returns. In this context, a &#x2018;right to withdraw an amount from the entity&#x2019; includes a policyholder&#x2019;s right to:</p><ol><li><li_value>(a)</li_value><p>receive a surrender value or refund of premiums on cancellation of a policy; or</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value><p>transfer an amount to another insurance provider.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
