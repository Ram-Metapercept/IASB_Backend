Under this approach, any difference between the amount recognised for the group of underlying insurance contracts and the reinsurance premium would be recognised in profit or loss when the group of reinsurance contracts held is initially recognised. This approach would depict a gain or loss equal to the shortfall or excess of the reinsurance premium the entity pays to the reinsurer above or below the premium that the entity receives from the policyholder. Thereafter, unearned profit from the group of underlying contracts would be offset by an equal and opposite expense for the reinsurance premium. However, in the Board&#x2019;s view, measuring the group of reinsurance contracts held on the basis of the premium the entity receives for the underlying contracts when that premium does not directly affect the cash flows arising from the group of reinsurance contracts held would be contrary to viewing the group of reinsurance contracts held and the underlying contracts as separate contracts. Such a measurement approach would also not reflect the economics of the group of reinsurance contracts the entity holds&#x2014;that the expense of purchasing the group of reinsurance contracts (that should be recognised over the coverage period) equals the whole of the consideration paid for the group of reinsurance contracts.</p></body></paragraph>
