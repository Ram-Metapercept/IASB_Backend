Insurance contracts are measured at current value, which, for an insurer that         is a mutual entity, incorporates information about the fair value of the other assets and         liabilities of the entity. Many of these other assets and liabilities are not required to be         measured at fair value in applying IFRS Standards; for example, amortised cost financial         assets, deferred tax balances, goodwill in subsidiaries and pension scheme surpluses and         deficits. Furthermore, the carrying amounts of assets that are not measured at fair value         are more likely to be measured at a value lower rather than higher than fair value because         of requirements to recognise impairments.<xref type="fn" keyref="footnotes/IFRS17_BC265-BC269_FN0001"/></p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
