The Board concluded that reinsurance contracts are not substantially investment-related service contracts. The variable fee approach was designed specifically so an entity issuing insurance contracts that are substantially investment-related service contracts would account for profit similarly to an entity issuing asset management contracts. Some stakeholders said that excluding reinsurance contracts held from the scope of the variable fee approach creates an accounting mismatch when a reinsurance contract held covers underlying insurance contracts that are within the scope of the variable fee approach. The Board responded to that concern by amending the risk mitigation option (see paragraphs BC256A&#x2012;BC256B).</p></body></paragraph>
