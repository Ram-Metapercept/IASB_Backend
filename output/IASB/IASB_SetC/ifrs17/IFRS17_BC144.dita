However, IFRS 17 requires onerous groups to         be recognised only when facts and circumstances indicate that a group of insurance contracts         is onerous. That approach ensures that entities recognise adverse changes in circumstances         without the need to track groups before the coverage period begins.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
