To apply the amendment described in paragraph BC315A in that circumstance, an entity needs to determine amounts at a level that is lower than the level of the group of insurance contracts. IFRS 17 does not require an entity to track insurance contracts at a level lower than the level of the group of insurance contracts. Accordingly, the Board specified that, in that circumstance, an entity applies a systematic and rational method of allocation to determine the portion of losses on a group of insurance contracts that relates to underlying insurance contracts covered by a reinsurance contract held. Requiring a systematic and rational method of allocation is consistent with other requirements in IFRS 17.</p></body></paragraph>
