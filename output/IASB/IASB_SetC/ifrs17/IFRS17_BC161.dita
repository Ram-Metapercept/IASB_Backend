Thus, that point would lie within the boundary of the existing contract, unless the restriction on the entity&#x2019;s ability to reprice the contract is so minimal that it is expected to have no commercial substance (ie the restriction has no discernible effect on the economics of the transaction). In the Board&#x2019;s view, a restriction with no commercial substance does not bind the entity.</p></body></paragraph>
