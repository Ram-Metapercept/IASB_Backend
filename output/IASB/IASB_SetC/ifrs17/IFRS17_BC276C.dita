The fulfilment cash flows are a current risk-adjusted estimate of future cash flows expected to arise from a group of insurance contracts. In contrast, the contractual service margin is the profit expected to arise from future service that an entity will provide for a group of insurance contracts. The contractual service margin on initial recognition of a group is the difference between the estimated cash inflows and estimated cash outflows (adjusted for the effect of the time value of money, non-financial risk and financial risk). The contractual service margin is not a future cash flow. When changes in fulfilment cash flows relate to future service, the expected profit relating to that future service changes. Accordingly, those changes in estimates adjust the contractual service margin.</p></body></paragraph>
