The objective of the level of aggregation requirements in IFRS 17 is to provide useful information for users of financial statements. Aspects of internal management such as asset and liability management strategy or risk management strategy have different objectives. Hence an approach based on those aspects would not necessarily achieve the Board&#x2019;s objective.</p></body></paragraph>
