This would have been similar to the disclosure for unobservable inputs in fair value measurement considered by the Board when developing <xref base="F59415654" href="../ifrs13/IFRS13_TOC.dita#IFRS13_TOC0001/IFRS13_TOC0001_V2" id="IFRS17_X1859">IFRS 13</xref> (as described in <xref base="F59415696" href="../ifrs13/IFRS13_gBC202-BC210.dita#IFRS13_gBC202-BC210/IFRS13_gBC202-BC210_TI" id="IFRS17_X1860">paragraphs BC202&#x2013;BC210 of the Basis for Conclusions on IFRS 13</xref>). When finalising IFRS 13, the Board decided not to require such a disclosure for unobservable inputs in IFRS 13 because of concerns about costs relative to benefits, but instead required more quantitative information about the inputs as well as narrative information about how those inputs influence the measurement (as described in <xref base="F59415697" href="../ifrs13/IFRS13_gBC188-BC195.dita#IFRS13_gBC188-BC195/IFRS13_gBC188-BC195_TI" id="IFRS17_X1861">paragraphs BC188&#x2013;BC195</xref> and <xref base="F59415698" href="../ifrs13/IFRS13_BC206.dita#IFRS13_BC206" id="IFRS17_X1862">BC206&#x2013;BC208 of the Basis for Conclusions on IFRS 13</xref>). Accordingly, consistent with its decision for IFRS 13, the Board did not include such a disclosure requirement in IFRS 17.</p></body></paragraph>
