An entity applying that modification determines the carrying amount of the contractual service margin at the transition date in a more direct way than the entity would by applying the modifications in paragraphs C11&#x2212;C16 of IFRS 17 for determining the contractual service margin at the transition date for insurance contracts without direct participation features. An entity can determine the contractual service margin in this more direct way because of the extent to which the contractual service margin is remeasured for insurance contracts with direct participation features. Some stakeholders suggested that an entity should be able to apply the modifications in paragraphs C11&#x2212;C16 of IFRS 17 to insurance contracts with direct participation features. The Board disagreed with this suggestion because applying those modifications to such contracts would be unlikely to achieve an outcome as close to retrospective application as would applying paragraph C17 of IFRS 17.</p></body></paragraph>
