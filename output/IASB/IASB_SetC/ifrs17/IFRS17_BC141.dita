Those expressing that view stated that accounting for the group of insurance contracts before the coverage period begins would require system changes whose high costs outweigh the benefits of doing so, particularly because the amount recognised before the coverage period begins might be immaterial, or even nil. In the view of these respondents, even if amounts recognised before the coverage period begins are insignificant, requiring an entity to account for groups of insurance contracts in the pre-coverage period would impose on the entity the requirement to track groups to demonstrate that the amounts are insignificant.</p></body></paragraph>
