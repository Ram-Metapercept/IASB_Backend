An entity&#x2019;s decision to apply IFRS 9 to insurance contracts that limit the compensation for insured events to the amount otherwise required to settle the policyholder&#x2019;s obligation created by the contract could change, either partially or in full, the classification and measurement of such contracts. Such changes may create or eliminate accounting mismatches between the contracts and financial liabilities an entity might consider to be related to the contracts. Therefore, the Board amended the IFRS 9 transition requirements to permit an entity to designate, or require an entity to revoke its previous designation of, a financial liability at the date of initial application of these amendments to the extent that a new accounting mismatch is created, or a previous accounting mismatch no longer exists, as a result of the application of these amendments.</p></body></paragraph>
