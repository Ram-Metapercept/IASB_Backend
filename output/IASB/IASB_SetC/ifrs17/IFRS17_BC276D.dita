An entity would measure profit inconsistently if it were to measure the effect of future cash flows on the contractual service margin at discount rates that differed depending on when such future cash flows become part of the expected cash flows. The Board concluded that measuring the contractual service margin at the discount rates determined at the date of initial recognition (that is, locked-in discount rates) provides a faithful representation of the revenue earned as the entity provides services, reflecting the price set at the contract issue date for that service. In contrast, measuring changes in the contractual service margin using current rates would result in arbitrary amounts relating to the effects of changes in discount rates being reflected in the insurance service result rather than in insurance finance income or expenses. A core benefit introduced by IFRS 17 is the presentation of insurance finance income or expenses separately from the insurance service result.</p></body></paragraph>
