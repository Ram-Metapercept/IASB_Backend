Because IFRS 17 only requires retrospective application on transition if practicable, and specifies simplified approaches when retrospective application is impracticable, the Board expects that determining the comparative amounts will not require significant incremental time and resources beyond those required to first apply IFRS 17. The Board set the effective date for IFRS 17 based on information given about the necessary time to prepare, in the knowledge that restated comparative information for one reporting period would be required.</p></body></paragraph>
