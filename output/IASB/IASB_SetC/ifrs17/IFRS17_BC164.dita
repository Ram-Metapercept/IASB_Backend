For example, in one reporting period an entity may decide that a renewal premium for a portfolio of contracts is outside the contract boundary because the restriction on the entity&#x2019;s ability to reprice the contract has no commercial substance. However, if circumstances change so that the same restrictions on the entity&#x2019;s ability to reprice the portfolio take on commercial substance, the entity may conclude that future renewal premiums for that portfolio of contracts are within the boundary of the contract.</p></body></paragraph>
