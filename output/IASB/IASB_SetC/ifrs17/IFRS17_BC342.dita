The current period book yield is the change in the carrying amount of assets regarded as backing the insurance contracts that is recognised in profit or loss for the period. The Board rejected this approach, except as discussed in <xref id="IFRS17_X1787" base="F59411076" href="IFRS17_BC48.dita#IFRS17_BC48">paragraph BC48</xref>, because recognising insurance finance income or expenses in profit or loss measured using a discount rate that has no relationship to the rate that is used to measure the group of insurance contracts does not provide useful information. In addition, it may be difficult in some circumstances to identify the assets that are held by the entities to back insurance contract liabilities.</p></body></paragraph>
