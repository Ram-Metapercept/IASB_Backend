Accordingly, the Board decided that IFRS 17 should be applied by all entities for annual         periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021, a period of approximately three and a half         years from publication of the Standard. This allows entities a period of two and a half         years to prepare, taking into account the need to restate comparative information.<xref type="fn" keyref="footnotes/IFRS17_BC403_FN0001"/></p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
