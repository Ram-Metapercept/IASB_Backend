However, many       respondents had some concerns&#x2014;in particular about including the existing       concept of &#x2018;obscuring&#x2019; (as set out in paragraph 30A of IAS 1) in the definition of       material in the way proposed in the Exposure Draft. Many respondents thought       that if the Board were to include this concept in the definition, then &#x2018;obscuring       information&#x2019; would need to be more precisely defined or explained than it was       in the Exposure Draft.</p></body></paragraph>
