The Board did so to better enable             preparers to apply judgement and thereby disclose only material accounting policy             information. In many cases, information about the measurement basis (or bases) used in             preparing the financial statements is material. However, in some cases, the measurement             basis (or bases) used for a particular asset or liability would not be material and,             therefore, would not need to be disclosed. For example, information about a measurement             basis might be immaterial if: <ol type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>                     <p>an IFRS Standard required an entity to use a measurement basis&#x2014;in which case                         an entity would not apply choice or judgement in complying with the                         Standard; and</p>                 </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>                     <p>information about the measurement basis would not be needed for users to                         understand the related material transactions, other events or                         conditions.</p>                 </li></ol></p></body></paragraph>
