Those with this concern think that some subtotals can be misleading, for example, because they are given undue prominence. The Board noted that paragraphs 55 and 85 of IAS 1 require the presentation of subtotals when such presentation is relevant to an understanding of the entity&#x2019;s financial position or financial performance.</p></body></paragraph>
