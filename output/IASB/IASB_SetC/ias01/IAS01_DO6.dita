The same paragraph states: &#x2018;The IASB&#x2019;s objective is to require like transactions and events to be accounted for <i>and reported</i> in a like way and unlike transactions and events to be accounted for <i>and reported</i> differently&#x2019; (emphasis added). By permitting a choice in this instance, the IASB has abandoned that principle.</p></body></paragraph>
