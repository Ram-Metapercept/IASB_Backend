Specifically, the Board was asked to consider whether an entity should be required to present a complete set of financial statements when it provides financial statements beyond the minimum comparative information requirements (ie additional comparative information). In response to this request, the Board decided to clarify that additional financial statement information need not be presented in the form of a complete set of financial statements for periods beyond the minimum requirements. The Board also noted that additional comparative information might include:</p><ol id="IAS01_L0088" base="F18632278" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IAS01_P4090" base="F18632279">information that is presented voluntarily, beyond the information that is included within a complete set of financial statements; or</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IAS01_P4091" base="F18632281">comparative information that is required by law or other regulations but that is not required by IFRSs.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
