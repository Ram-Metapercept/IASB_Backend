Paragraph 12 of the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph><xref keyref="footnotes/IAS01_FN0064" type="fn"/> states that the objective of financial statements is to provide information about the financial position, performance and changes in financial position of an entity; paragraph 19 of the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph> states that information about financial position is primarily provided in a balance sheet. In the Board&#x2019;s view, the title &#x2018;balance sheet&#x2019; simply reflects that double entry bookkeeping requires debits to equal credits. It does not identify the content or purpose of the statement. The Board also noted that &#x2018;financial position&#x2019; is a well&#x2011;known and accepted term, as it has been used in auditors&#x2019; opinions internationally for more than 20 years to describe what the &#x2018;balance sheet&#x2019; presents. The Board decided that aligning the statement&#x2019;s title with its content and the opinion rendered by the auditor would help the users of financial statements.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
