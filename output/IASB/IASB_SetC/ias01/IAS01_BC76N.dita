However, accounting policy information may be considered material when that information is considered together with other information in a complete set of financial statements. In the Board&#x2019;s view, accounting policy information is expected to be material if its disclosure were needed for primary users to understand information provided about material transactions, other events or conditions in the financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
