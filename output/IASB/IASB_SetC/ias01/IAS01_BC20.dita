The term &#x2018;comprehensive income&#x2019; is not defined in the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph> but is used in IAS 1 to describe the change in equity of an entity during a period from transactions, events and circumstances other than those resulting from transactions with owners in their capacity as owners. Although the term &#x2018;comprehensive income&#x2019; is used to describe the aggregate of all components of comprehensive income, including profit or loss, the term &#x2018;other comprehensive income&#x2019; refers to income and expenses that under IFRSs are included in comprehensive income but excluded from profit or loss.</p></body></paragraph>
