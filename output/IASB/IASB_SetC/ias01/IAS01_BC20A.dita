One of the proposals in the exposure draft related to the title of the statement containing profit or loss and other comprehensive income. The Board proposed this change so that it would be clear that the statement had two components: profit or loss and other comprehensive income. A majority of the respondents to the exposure draft supported the change and therefore the Board confirmed the proposal in June 2011. IAS 1 allows preparers to use other titles for the statement that reflect the nature of their activities.</p></body></paragraph>
