This amendment is not expected to substantively change an entity&#x2019;s decisions about whether information is material&#x2014;in no circumstances would obscuring information influence the decisions of users, if omitting or misstating the same information would have no influence on those decisions.</p>       </li></ol><p>Consequently, the Board expects that the effect of the revised definition will be to help entities to make better materiality judgements.</p></body></paragraph>
