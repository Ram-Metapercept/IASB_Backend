The Board also noted that entities can have difficulty understanding the difference, if any, between &#x2018;significant&#x2019; and &#x2018;material&#x2019; accounting policies. The Board considered developing a definition of &#x2018;significant&#x2019;, but concluded that this approach could have unintended consequences for other uses of the term &#x2018;significant&#x2019; in IFRS Standards.</p></body></paragraph>
