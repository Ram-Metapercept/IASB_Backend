The Board                         concluded that this amendment would help an entity reduce immaterial                         accounting policy disclosures in its financial statements.</p>                 </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>                     <p>provide examples of circumstances in which an entity would normally conclude                         that information about an accounting policy is material to its financial                         statements (see <xref href="IAS01_117B.dita#IAS01_117B">paragraph                             117B</xref>). The examples listed in paragraph 117B are not exhaustive                         but the Board concluded that they would help an entity determine whether                         accounting policy information is material.</p>                 </li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value>                     <p>explain that entity-specific accounting policy information is more useful to                         users of financial statements than accounting policy information that is                         standardised, or that duplicates or summarises the requirements of IFRS                         Standards (see <xref href="IAS01_117C.dita#IAS01_117C">paragraph                         117C</xref>). The Board concluded that this amendment would help an entity                         focus on disclosing accounting policy information that users have identified                         as the most useful.</p>                 </li></ol>         </p></body></paragraph>
