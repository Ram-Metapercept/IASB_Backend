The nature or function of a transaction or other event, rather than its frequency, should determine its presentation within the income statement. Items currently classified as &#x2018;extraordinary&#x2019; are only a subset of the items of income and expense that may warrant disclosure to assist users in predicting an entity&#x2019;s future performance.</p></body></paragraph>
