However, some respondents suggested that the Board should use the term &#x2018;recycling&#x2019;, rather than &#x2018;reclassification&#x2019; as the former term is more common. The Board concluded that both terms are similar in meaning, but decided to use the term &#x2018;reclassification adjustment&#x2019; to converge with the terminology used in SFAS 130.</p></body></paragraph>
