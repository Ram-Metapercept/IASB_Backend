They argued that disclosure about breaches of externally imposed capital requirements and the associated regulatory measures subsequently imposed could be disproportionately damaging to entities. The Board was not persuaded by these arguments because it believes that such concerns indicate that information about breaches of externally imposed capital requirements may often be material by its nature. The <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph> states that &#x2018;Information is material if its omission or misstatement could influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.&#x2019; Similarly, the Board decided not to provide an exemption for temporary non&#x2011;compliance with regulatory requirements during the year. Information that an entity is sufficiently close to its limits to breach them, even on a temporary basis, is useful for users.</p></body></paragraph>
