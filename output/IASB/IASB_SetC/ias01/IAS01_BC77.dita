An example of these judgements is how management determines whether financial assets are held&#x2011;to&#x2011;maturity investments.<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS01_FN0071" type="fn"/> The Board decided that disclosure of the most important of these judgements would enable users of financial statements to understand better how the accounting policies are applied and to make comparisons between entities regarding the basis on which managements make these judgements.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
