Consequently, in <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Improvements to IFRSs</ph></ph> issued in April 2009, the Board amended the proposed wording to clarify that the amendment applies only to the classification of a liability that can, at the option of the counterparty, be settled by the issue of the entity&#x2019;s equity instruments.</p></body></paragraph>
