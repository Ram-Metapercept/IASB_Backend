If an entity chooses to present comprehensive income by using two statements, it should begin the second statement with profit or loss&#x2014;the bottom line of the first statement (the &#x2018;income statement&#x2019;)&#x2014;and display the components of other comprehensive income immediately after that. The Board concluded that this is the best way to achieve the objective of equal prominence (see <xref id="IAS01_X0947" base="F4756218" href="IAS01_BC22.dita#IAS01_BC22">paragraph BC22</xref>) for the presentation of income and expenses. An entity that chooses to display comprehensive income in one statement should include profit or loss as a subtotal within that statement.</p></body></paragraph>
