This wording helps to           address concerns raised by some parties that the threshold &#x2018;could influence&#x2019; in the           existing definition of material is too low and might be applied too broadly (see paragraph           BC13D(a)).</p></li><li id="IAS01_BC13H_b"><li_value>(b)</li_value><p>using the wording of the definition of material in the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual             Framework</ph></ph>.<xref type="fn" keyref="footnotes/IAS01_BC13H_FN0001"/> The Board           concluded that this wording was clearer than the definition in IAS 1 and IAS 8. However,           the Board decided to refer to &#x2018;financial statements&#x2019; rather than &#x2018;financial reports&#x2019; in           the amendments to IAS 1 to be consistent with the scope of that Standard.<xref type="fn" keyref="footnotes/IAS01_BC13H_FN0002"/> The <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual             Framework</ph></ph> definition also clarifies that the users to whom the definition           refers are the primary users of an entity&#x2019;s financial reports or statements. Referring to           the primary users in the definition of material in IAS 1 helps to respond to concerns that           the term &#x2018;users&#x2019; may be interpreted too widely (see paragraph BC13D(c)).</p></li><li id="IAS01_BC13H_c"><li_value>(c)</li_value><p>including &#x2018;obscuring&#x2019; in the definition of material to           incorporate the existing concept in paragraph 30A of IAS 1 which states: &#x2018;An entity shall           not reduce the understandability of its financial statements by obscuring material           information with immaterial information or by aggregating items that have different           natures or functions.&#x2019; Referring to &#x2018;obscuring&#x2019; in the definition of material is intended           to respond to concerns that the effect of including immaterial information should also be           considered in addition to &#x2018;misstating&#x2019; and &#x2018;omitting&#x2019; (see paragraphs BC13D(a) and           (b)).</p></li><li id="IAS01_BC13H_d"><li_value>(d)</li_value><p>relocating wording that explains rather than defines material           from the definition itself to its explanatory paragraphs. This reorganisation clarifies           which requirements are part of the definition and which paragraphs explain the           definition.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
