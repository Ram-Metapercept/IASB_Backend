Distinguishing between those items reported in profit or loss and those reported elsewhere is accomplished by the requirement for relevant subtotals to be included in a statement of comprehensive income. Respondents also stated that a two&#x2011;statement approach gives primacy to the &#x2018;income statement&#x2019;; that conflicts with the Board&#x2019;s requirement in <xref id="IAS01_X1002" base="F4757265" href="IAS01_11.dita#IAS01_11">paragraph 11</xref> of IAS 1 to give equal prominence to all financial statements within a set of financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
