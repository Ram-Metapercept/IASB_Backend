MsÂ Flores believes that the notion of complexity is highly subjective and, therefore,             does not constitute a robust basis for a requirement. Introducing such a subjective             assessment could, in her view, undermine the overall aim of the amendments, which is to             contribute to a better application of the concept of materiality to accounting policy             disclosures and thereby help an entity reduce the disclosure of immaterial accounting             policy information. Facing such subjective judgements, an entity may opt for &#x2018;being on             the safe side&#x2019;, providing more information than is required. In her view, paragraph             117B(e) of IAS 1 is an unsatisfactory response to feedback from users of financial             statements who said they find entity-specific accounting policy information to be more             useful than information that is standardised or that duplicates or summarises the             requirements of IFRS Standards.</p></body></paragraph>
