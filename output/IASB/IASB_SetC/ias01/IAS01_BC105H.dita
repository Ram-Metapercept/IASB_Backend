Paragraph 15 explains that the application of IFRS Standards, with additional disclosure when necessary, is presumed to result in financial statements that achieve fair presentation. Revisions of the <i>Conceptual Framework</i> will not automatically lead to changes in IFRS Standards. Hence, entities are expected to continue applying IFRS Standards in preparing their financial statements even in cases in which the requirements of a particular Standard depart from aspects of the <i>Conceptual Framework</i>.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IAS01_P4296" base="F75074803">In paragraphs 19&#x2013;20 and 23&#x2013;24, replacing the reference to the <i>Framework</i> means referring to the revised description of the objective of financial statements in the 2018 <i>Conceptual Framework</i> instead of the description provided by the <i>Framework</i>. The objective did not change substantively&#x2014;it is an adapted and updated version of the objective of financial statements from the <i>Framework</i> and paragraph 9 of IAS 1. Hence, applying the revised objective is not expected to lead to changes in the application of the requirements in paragraphs 19&#x2013;20 and 23&#x2013;24.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IAS01_P4297" base="F75074809">In paragraph 28, replacing the reference to the <i>Framework</i> in the discussion of the accrual basis of accounting is not expected to result in any changes because no changes were made to the discussion of the accrual basis of accounting in the 2018 <i>Conceptual Framework</i>.</p></li><li><li_value>(d)</li_value> <p id="IAS01_P4298" base="F75074813">In paragraph 89, replacing the reference to the <i>Framework</i> means referring to the revised definitions of income and expenses in the 2018 <i>Conceptual Framework</i>. The Board concluded that this is unlikely to lead to changes in applying the requirements of IAS 1 because the definitions of income and expenses in the 2018 <i>Conceptual Framework</i> were updated only to align them with the revised definitions of an asset and a liability. Moreover, the main purpose of paragraph 89 is to indicate that particular items of income or expenses can be recognised outside profit or loss only if required by other IFRS Standards.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
