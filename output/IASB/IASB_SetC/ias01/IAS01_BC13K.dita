However, the Board decided that the benefit       of including &#x2018;obscuring&#x2019; in the definition of material outweighed these       concerns. Including this concept emphasises that obscuring information can       affect the decisions of primary users just as omitting or misstating that information can. In particular, including &#x2018;obscuring&#x2019; in the definition of       material addresses concerns that the former definition could be perceived by       stakeholders as focusing only on information that cannot be omitted (material       information) and not also on why it may be unhelpful to include immaterial       information.</p></body></paragraph>
