The Board agreed that paragraph 82A allowed for diverse interpretations, and therefore decided to amend IAS 1 as follows:</p><ol id="IAS01_L0097" base="F38871513" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>           <p id="IAS01_P4186" base="F38871515">to clarify that paragraph 82A requires entities to present the share of other comprehensive income of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method, separated into the share of items that:</p>           <ol id="IAS01_L0098" base="F38871516" type="lower-roman"><li><li_value>(i)</li_value>               <p id="IAS01_P4187" base="F38871518">will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss; and</p>             </li><li><li_value>(ii)</li_value>               <p id="IAS01_P4188" base="F38871520">will be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss when specific conditions are met.</p>             </li></ol>                    </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>           <p id="IAS01_P4190" base="F38871522">to amend the Guidance on Implementing IAS 1 to reflect the clarification of paragraph 82A.</p>         </li></ol><p id="IAS01_P4191" base="F38871523">The Board noted that whether an amount is reclassified to profit or loss is determined by the nature of the underlying item. It also noted that the timing of reclassification is usually determined by the actions of the investee. It may however also be triggered by the investor, which would be the case on the disposal of the investee by the investor.</p></body></paragraph>
