In their view the decision about a single&#x2011;statement or two&#x2011;statement approach should be subject to further consideration. They urged the Board to address other aspects of presentation and display, namely deciding which categories and line items should be presented in a &#x2018;statement of comprehensive income&#x2019;. The Board reaffirmed its reasons for preferring a single&#x2011;statement approach and agreed to address other aspects of display and presentation in the next stage of the project.</p></body></paragraph>
