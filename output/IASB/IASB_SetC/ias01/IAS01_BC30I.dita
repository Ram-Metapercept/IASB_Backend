The Board considered making amendments to paragraph 31 of IAS 1 to say that an entity need not provide a specific disclosure if the information provided by that disclosure is not material, either individually or collectively. However, the Board decided not to make that change since the definition of material already incorporates the notions of individual and collective assessment and, therefore, reference to the term material in paragraph 31 is sufficient to incorporate this concept.</p></body></paragraph>
