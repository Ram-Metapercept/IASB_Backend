The Board considered whether it should change all such references to &#x2018;statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income&#x2019;. The Board noted that the terminology used in IAS 1 is not mandatory and that &#x2018;statement of comprehensive income&#x2019; is one of the examples used in the standard. The Board decided that there was little benefit in replacing the title &#x2018;statement of comprehensive income&#x2019; in other IFRSs or &#x2018;income statement&#x2019; with the &#x2018;statement of profit or loss&#x2019;. However, the Board did change the terminology when an IFRS made reference to the two&#x2011;statement option.</p></body></paragraph>
