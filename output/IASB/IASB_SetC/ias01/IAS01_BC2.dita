The project was undertaken in the light of queries and criticisms raised in relation to the standards by securities regulators, professional accountants and other interested parties. The objectives of the Improvements project were to reduce or eliminate alternatives, redundancies and conflicts within standards, to deal with some convergence issues and to make other improvements. The Board&#x2019;s intention was not to reconsider the fundamental approach to the presentation of financial statements established by IAS 1 in 1997.</p></body></paragraph>
