This emphasis is different from that of a shareholder. Thus, it could be misleading to suggest that the regulator&#x2019;s risk assessment could, or should, be a substitute for independent analysis by investors.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IAS01_P4261" base="F4009214">The disclosure of entity&#x2011;specific capital requirements imposed by a regulator might undermine that regulator&#x2019;s ability to impose such requirements. For example, the information could cause depositors to withdraw funds, a prospect that might discourage regulators from imposing requirements. Furthermore, an entity&#x2019;s regulatory dialogue would become public, which might not be appropriate in all circumstances.</p></li><li><li_value>(d)</li_value> <p id="IAS01_P4262" base="F4009236">Because different regulators have different tools available, for example formal requirements and moral suasion, a requirement to disclose entity&#x2011;specific capital requirements could not be framed in a way that would lead to the provision of information that is comparable across entities.</p></li><li><li_value>(e)</li_value> <p id="IAS01_P4263" base="F4009238">Disclosure of capital requirements (and hence, regulatory judgements) could hamper clear communication to the entity of the regulator&#x2019;s assessment by creating incentives to use moral suasion and other informal mechanisms.</p></li><li><li_value>(f)</li_value> <p id="IAS01_P4264" base="F4009240">Disclosure requirements should not focus on entity&#x2011;specific capital requirements in isolation, but should focus on how entity&#x2011;specific capital requirements affect how an entity manages and determines the adequacy of its capital resources.</p></li><li><li_value>(g)</li_value> <p id="IAS01_P4265" base="F4009242">A requirement to disclose entity&#x2011;specific capital requirements imposed by a regulator is not part of Pillar 3 of the Basel II Framework developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
