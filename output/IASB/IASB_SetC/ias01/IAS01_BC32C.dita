The Board&#x2019;s decision to give this relief was based on the fact that circumstances in which an entity changes an accounting policy, or makes a retrospective restatement or a reclassification in accordance with <xref base="F18656951" href="../ias08/IAS08_TOC.dita#IAS08_TOC0001" id="IAS01_X0898">IAS 8</xref>, are considered narrow, specific and limited. However, the circumstances in which an entity chooses to provide additional financial statements (ie on a voluntary basis) can be viewed as more generic and may arise for different reasons. Accordingly, this relief is not available when additional financial statements are provided on a voluntary basis.</p></body></paragraph>
