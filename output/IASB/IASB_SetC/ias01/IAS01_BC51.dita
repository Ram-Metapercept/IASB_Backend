The Board provided several reasons for this preference. All items of non&#x2011;owner changes in equity meet the definitions of income and expenses in the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph>. The <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph> does not define profit or loss, nor does it provide criteria for distinguishing the characteristics of items that should be included in profit or loss from those items that should be excluded from profit or loss. Therefore, the Board decided that it was conceptually correct for an entity to present all non&#x2011;owner changes in equity (ie all income and expenses recognised in a period) in a single statement because there are no clear principles or common characteristics that can be used to separate income and expenses into two statements.</p></body></paragraph>
