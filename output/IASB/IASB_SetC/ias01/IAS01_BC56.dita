In such cases, the Board notes that the entity should ensure that the amount disclosed is representative of activities that would normally be regarded as &#x2018;operating&#x2019;. In the Board&#x2019;s view, it would be misleading and would impair the comparability of financial statements if items of an operating nature were excluded from the results of operating activities, even if that had been industry practice. For example, it would be inappropriate to exclude items clearly related to operations (such as inventory write&#x2011;downs and restructuring and relocation expenses) because they occur irregularly or infrequently or are unusual in amount. Similarly, it would be inappropriate to exclude items on the grounds that they do not involve cash flows, such as depreciation and amortisation expenses.</p></body></paragraph>
