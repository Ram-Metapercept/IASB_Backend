If an entity alters the order of the notes or the information presented or disclosed compared to the previous year, it also adjusts the comparative information to align with the current period presentation and disclosure. For that reason, IAS 1 already provides relief from having to disclose comparative information that is not considered relevant in the current period and requires comparative information for new amounts presented or disclosed in the current period.</p></body></paragraph>
