The Board finalised these changes in June 2011 and decided that the effective dates for these changes should be for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012, with earlier application permitted. The Board did not think that a long transition period was needed as the changes to presentation are small and the presentation required by the amendments is already allowed under IAS 1.</p></body></paragraph>
