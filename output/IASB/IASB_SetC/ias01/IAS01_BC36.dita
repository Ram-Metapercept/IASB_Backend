Moreover, balancing costs and benefits was a task for the Board when it sets accounting requirements rather than for entities when they apply them. Therefore, the Board retained the &#x2018;impracticability&#x2019; criterion for exemption. This affects the exemptions now set out in <xref id="IAS01_X0914" base="F4756172" href="IAS01_41.dita#IAS01_41">paragraphs 41&#x2013;43</xref> <xref id="IAS01_X0915" base="F4756173" href="IAS01_131.dita#IAS01_131">and 131</xref> of IAS 1. Impracticability is the only basis on which IFRSs allow specific exemptions from applying particular requirements when the effect of applying them is material.<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS01_FN0065" type="fn"/></p></body></paragraph>
