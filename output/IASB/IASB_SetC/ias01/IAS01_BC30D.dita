For this reason, the Board removed the phrase &#x2018;as a minimum&#x2019; in paragraph 54 of IAS 1, which lists line items for presentation in the statement of financial position. This also makes the requirement broadly consistent with the corresponding requirement in paragraph 82 of IAS 1 for the profit or loss section of the statement of comprehensive income or the statement of profit or loss.</p></body></paragraph>
