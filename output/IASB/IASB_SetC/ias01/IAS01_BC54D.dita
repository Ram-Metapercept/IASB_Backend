In October 2008 the Board and the FASB jointly published a discussion paper, <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Preliminary Views on Financial Statement Presentation</ph></ph>. In that paper, the boards proposed eliminating the alternative presentation formats for comprehensive income and to require an entity to present comprehensive income and its components in a single statement. The boards asked for views on that proposal. The responses were split on whether an entity should present comprehensive income and its components in a single statement or in two separate statements. In general, respondents supporting a single statement of comprehensive income said that it would lead to greater transparency, consistency and comparability. Furthermore, the process of calculating financial ratios would be made easier.</p></body></paragraph>
