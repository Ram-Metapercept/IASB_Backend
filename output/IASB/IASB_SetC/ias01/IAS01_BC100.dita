However, the Board confirmed its view that when an entity has policies and processes for managing capital, qualitative disclosures about these policies and processes are useful. The Board also concluded that these disclosures, together with disclosure of the components of equity and their changes during the year (required by <xref id="IAS01_X0988" base="F15824689" href="IAS01_g106-110.dita#IAS01_g106-110">paragraphs 106&#x2013;110</xref>), would give sufficient information about entities that are not regulated or subject to externally imposed capital requirements.</p></body></paragraph>
