They advocated classifying a liability as current or non&#x2011;current according to whether it is expected to use current assets of the entity, rather than strictly on the basis of its date of maturity and whether it is callable at the end of the reporting period. In their view, this would provide more relevant information about the liability&#x2019;s future effect on the timing of the entity&#x2019;s resource flows.</p></body></paragraph>
