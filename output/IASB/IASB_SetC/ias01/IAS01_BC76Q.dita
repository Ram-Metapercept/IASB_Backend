Consequently, in assessing whether accounting policy information is material, an entity             is required to consider not just the size of the transactions, other events or             conditions to which the accounting policy information relates, but also the nature of             those transactions, other events or conditions. To clarify this point, the Board             included in the amendments an explanation that accounting policy information can be             judged material because of the nature of the related transactions, other events or             conditions, even if the amounts to which that information relates are immaterial                 (see<xref href="IAS01_117A.dita#IAS01_117A"> paragraph 117A</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
