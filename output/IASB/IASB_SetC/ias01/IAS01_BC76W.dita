For             example, <xref href="../ias16/IAS16_73.dita#IAS16_73">paragraph 73 of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 16</ph>                     <ph outputclass="standard_title">Property, Plant and Equipment</ph></ph></xref>             requires an entity to disclose the measurement bases used for determining the gross             carrying amount of property, plant and equipment. The Board considered whether any of             these requirements should be changed because of the amendments to <xref href="IAS01_TOC.dita#IAS01_TOC0001">IAS 1</xref>. However, the Board noted that                 <xref href="IAS01_31.dita#IAS01_31">paragraph 31</xref> states that disclosure             requirements in IFRS Standards are subject to materiality judgements&#x2014;a disclosure             required by an IFRS Standard is required to be provided only if the information             resulting from that disclosure is material. Consequently, the Board concluded that             amendments to requirements relating to accounting policy disclosures in other IFRS             Standards are unnecessary.</p></body></paragraph>
