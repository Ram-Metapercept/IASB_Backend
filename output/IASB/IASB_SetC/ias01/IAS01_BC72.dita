Respondents suggested that the Board should expand the definition in <xref base="F5043077" href="IAS01_7.dita" scope="local" id="IAS01_X0959">paragraph 7</xref> to include gains and losses recognised in current periods in addition to those recognised in earlier periods, to make the definition consistent with <xref base="F19322294" href="IAS01_93.dita#IAS01_93/IAS01_93_V2" id="IAS01_X0960">paragraph 93</xref>. They commented that, without clarification, there could be differences between interim and annual reporting, for reclassifications of items that arise in one interim period and reverse out in a different interim period within the same annual period.</p></body></paragraph>
