Paragraph 114 stated that &#x2018;an entity normally presents notes in the [following] order&#x2019; and then listed a particular order for the notes. Some think that the use of &#x2018;normally&#x2019; makes it difficult for an entity to vary the order of the notes from the one that is listed in paragraph 114; for example, by disclosing the notes in order of importance or disclosing related information together in sections.</p></body></paragraph>
