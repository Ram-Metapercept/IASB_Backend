Being liable to income taxes is typical for many entities and it was not clear, from the example, what aspect of the entity&#x2019;s operations would make a user of financial statements expect an accounting policy on income taxes to be disclosed. Consequently, the example does not illustrate why an accounting policy on income taxes is significant. The Board also thought that the foreign currency accounting policy example in paragraph 120 of IAS 1 was unhelpful for the same reasons and therefore deleted the income taxes and foreign currency examples.</p></body></paragraph>
