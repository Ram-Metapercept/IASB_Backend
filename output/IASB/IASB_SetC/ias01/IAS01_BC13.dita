Because the Board did not intend to extend the definition of general purpose financial statements, it decided to eliminate the explanatory paragraph of what &#x2018;general purpose financial statements&#x2019; include, while retaining the definition of &#x2018;general purpose financial statements&#x2019;.</p></body></paragraph>
