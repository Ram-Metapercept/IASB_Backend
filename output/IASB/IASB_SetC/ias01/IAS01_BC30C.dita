In addition, some people think that when a line item is presented, or a material item is otherwise recognised, in the statement(s) of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and the statement of financial position, all the disclosures in IFRS specified for that item must be disclosed. The Board observed that paragraph 31 of IAS 1 is clear that the concept of materiality applies to specific disclosures required by an IFRS and therefore an entity does not have to disclose information required by an IFRS if that information would not be material.</p></body></paragraph>
