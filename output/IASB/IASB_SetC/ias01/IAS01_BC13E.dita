The Board believes that the substance of the definitions is the same because these definitions all cover the omission or misstatement of information that could influence the decisions of users of financial statements. Nevertheless, the existence of more than one definition of material could be confusing and could imply that the Board intended these definitions to have different meanings and be applied differently in practice.</p></body></paragraph>
