Considering that financial statements from prior years are readily available for financial analysis, the Board decided to require only two statements of financial position, except when the financial statements have been affected by retrospective application or retrospective restatement, as defined in <xref base="F5043042" href="../ias08/IAS08_TOC.dita#IAS08_TOC0001" id="IAS01_X0894">IAS 8 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors</ph></ph></xref>, or when a reclassification has been made. In those circumstances three statements of financial position are required.</p></body></paragraph>
