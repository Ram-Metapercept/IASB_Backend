In addition, to highlight that materiality not only involves decisions about excluding information from the financial statements, the Board amended paragraph 31 to reiterate the notion already stated in paragraph 17(c) of IAS 1 that materiality also involves decisions about whether to include additional information in the financial statements. Consequently, an entity should make additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users of financial statements to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity&#x2019;s financial position and financial performance.</p></body></paragraph>
