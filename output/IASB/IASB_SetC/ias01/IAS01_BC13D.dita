Feedback suggested that the Board       should address the following points:</p><ol type="lower-alpha"><li id="IAS01_BC13D_a"><li_value>(a)</li_value><p>the phrase &#x2018;could influence decisions of users&#x2019;, to describe the threshold         for deciding whether information is material, may be understood as         requiring too much information to be provided, because almost         anything &#x2018;could&#x2019; influence the decisions of some users of the financial         statements, even if such a possibility were remote;</p></li><li id="IAS01_BC13D_b"><li_value>(b)</li_value><p>the phrase &#x2018;information is material if omitting it or misstating it&#x2019; focuses         only on information that cannot be omitted (material information) and         does not also consider the effect of including immaterial information;         and</p></li><li id="IAS01_BC13D_c"><li_value>(c)</li_value><p>the definition refers to &#x2018;users&#x2019; but does not specify their characteristics,         which is interpreted by some as implying that an entity is required to         consider all possible users of its financial statements when deciding         what information to disclose.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
