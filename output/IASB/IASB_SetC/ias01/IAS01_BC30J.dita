However, respondents to the March 2014 Exposure Draft did not support the distinction between present and disclose because they considered that the terminology has not been used consistently throughout IAS 1 and that any changes in how these terms are used should be done as part of a comprehensive review of IAS 1. Because of this, and because making such comprehensive changes to IAS 1 would be outside the scope of these amendments, the Board did not finalise the proposed changes regarding use of the terms present and disclose.</p></body></paragraph>
