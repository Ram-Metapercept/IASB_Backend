However, some respondents pointed out that the terms &#x2018;owner&#x2019; and &#x2018;non&#x2011;owner&#x2019; were not defined in the exposure draft, the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph> or elsewhere in IFRSs, although they are extensively used in national accounting standards. They also noted that the terms &#x2018;owner&#x2019; and &#x2018;equity holder&#x2019; were used interchangeably in the exposure draft. The Board decided to adopt the term &#x2018;owner&#x2019; and use it throughout IAS 1 to converge with SFAS 130, which uses the term in the definition of &#x2018;comprehensive income&#x2019;.</p></body></paragraph>
