In a single&#x2011;statement presentation, all items of income and expense are presented together. In a two&#x2011;statement presentation, the first statement (&#x2018;income statement&#x2019;) presents income and expenses recognised in profit or loss and the second statement (&#x2018;statement of comprehensive income&#x2019;) begins with profit or loss and presents, in addition, items of income and expense that IFRSs require or permit to be recognised outside profit or loss. Such items include, for example, translation differences related to foreign operations and gains or losses on available&#x2011;for&#x2011;sale financial assets.<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS01_FN0068" type="fn"/> The statement of comprehensive income does not include transactions with owners in their capacity as owners. Such transactions are presented in the statement of changes in equity.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
