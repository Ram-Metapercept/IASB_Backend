Those respondents also said that a single statement would undermine the importance of profit or loss by making it a subtotal and that presenting total comprehensive income as the last number in the statement would confuse users. They also feared that requiring all items of income and expense to be presented in a single statement was the first step by the boards towards eliminating the notion of profit or loss. In addition, they argued that the items that are presented in OCI are different from items presented in profit or loss. Therefore they preferred either to keep the presentation of profit or loss separate from the presentation of OCI or to allow management to choose to present them either in a single statement or in two statements.</p></body></paragraph>
