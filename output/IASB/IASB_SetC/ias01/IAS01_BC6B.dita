The Board subsequently modified and confirmed the proposals and in June 2011 issued <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income</ph></ph> (Amendments to IAS 1). The amendments were developed in a joint project with the US national standard&#x2011;setter, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), with the aim of aligning the presentation of OCI so that information in financial statements prepared by entities using IFRSs and entities using US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) can be more easily compared.</p></body></paragraph>
