The Board noted that IAS 1 specifies that these effects are included in the statement of changes in equity. However, the Board decided to clarify that the effects of retrospective application or retrospective restatement are not changes in equity in the period, but provide a reconciliation between the previous period&#x2019;s closing balance and the opening balance in the statement of changes in equity.</p></body></paragraph>
