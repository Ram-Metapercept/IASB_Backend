When components of other comprehensive income are non&#x2011;cash items, they would become reconciling items in arriving at cash flows from operating activities and would add items to the statement of cash flows without adding information content. The Board concluded that an amendment to <xref id="IAS01_X0971" base="F4756604" href="../ias07/IAS07_TOC0001.dita#IAS07_TOC0001">IAS 7</xref> is not required; however, as mentioned in <xref id="IAS01_X0972" base="F4756605" href="IAS01_BC14.dita#IAS01_BC14">paragraph BC14</xref> the Board decided to relabel this financial statement as &#x2018;statement of cash flows&#x2019;.</p></body></paragraph>
