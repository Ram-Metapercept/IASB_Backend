This highlights that the line items listed for presentation in paragraph 54 of IAS 1 should be disaggregated and that subtotals should be presented, when relevant. Paragraphs 78 and 98 of IAS 1 give examples of potential disaggregations of line items in the statement of financial position and the statement(s) of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.</p></body></paragraph>
