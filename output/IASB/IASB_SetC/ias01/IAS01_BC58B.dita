Consequently, it added paragraph 85B to IAS 1. The purpose of this requirement is to help users of financial statements understand the relationship between the subtotals presented in accordance with paragraph 85 and the specific totals and subtotals required in IFRS to address concerns that that relationship would not be clear. The Board noted that such a requirement is already implicit in existing IFRS requirements. IFRS requires entities to present aggregated information as line items when such presentation provides material information. Consequently, because all recognised items of income and expense must be included in the statement(s) of profit or loss and other comprehensive income totals, any intervening line items and subtotals necessarily reconcile. However, the Board decided to make the requirement more explicit for the statement(s) of profit or loss and other comprehensive income to help users of financial statements understand the relationship between subtotals and totals presented in the statement(s) of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.</p></body></paragraph>
