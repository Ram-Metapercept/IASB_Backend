The titles will be used in future IFRSs but are not required to be used by entities in their financial statements. Some respondents to the exposure draft expressed concern that non&#x2011;mandatory titles will result in confusion. However, the Board believes that making use of the titles non&#x2011;mandatory will allow time for entities to implement changes gradually as the new titles become more familiar.</p></body></paragraph>
