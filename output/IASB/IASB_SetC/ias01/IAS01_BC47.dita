The revised IAS 1 requires that, for the loan to be classified as non&#x2011;current, the period of grace must end at least twelve months after the reporting period (see <xref id="IAS01_X0941" base="F4756214" href="IAS01_75.dita#IAS01_75">paragraph 75</xref>). Therefore, the conditions (a) and (b) in <xref id="IAS01_X0942" base="F4756215" href="IAS01_BC46.dita#IAS01_BC46">paragraph BC46</xref> are redundant.</p></body></paragraph>
