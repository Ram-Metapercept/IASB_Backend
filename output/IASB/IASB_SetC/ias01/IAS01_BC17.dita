The Board observed that although the latter statements reflect changes in an entity&#x2019;s financial position, neither can be called a &#x2018;statement of changes in financial position&#x2019;, as this would not depict their true function and objective (ie to present cash flows and performance, respectively). The Board acknowledged that the titles &#x2018;income statement&#x2019; and &#x2018;statement of profit or loss&#x2019; are similar in meaning and could be used interchangeably, and decided to retain the title &#x2018;income statement&#x2019; as this is more commonly used.</p></body></paragraph>
