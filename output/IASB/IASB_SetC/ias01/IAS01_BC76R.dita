In the Board&#x2019;s view, accounting policy information that includes standardised information or that duplicates or summarises some of the requirements of IFRS Standards is generally less useful to users than entity-specific accounting policy information. However, the Board agreed that such accounting policy information is expected to be material if it is needed to understand other material information in the financial statements. The Board concluded that when such information is material, it is required to be disclosed.</p></body></paragraph>
