The &#x2018;gross presentation&#x2019; facilitated the traceability of other comprehensive income items to profit or loss, because items of profit or loss are generally displayed before tax. The &#x2018;net presentation&#x2019; facilitated the identification of other comprehensive income items in the equity section of the statement of financial position. A majority of respondents supported allowing both approaches. The Board reaffirmed its conclusion that components of other comprehensive income could be displayed either (a) net of related tax effects or (b) before related tax effects.</p></body></paragraph>
