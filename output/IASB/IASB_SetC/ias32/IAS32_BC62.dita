The Board concluded that it is inappropriate to consider cash flows and contractual features related to the instrument holder in a non&#x2011;owner role when evaluating whether a financial instrument has the features set out in <xref id="IAS32_X1079" base="F16144002" href="IAS32_16A.dita#IAS32_16A">paragraph 16A</xref> or <xref id="IAS32_X1080" base="F16144003" href="IAS32_16C.dita#IAS32_16C">paragraph 16C</xref>. That is because those cash flows and contractual features are separate and distinct from the cash flows and contractual features of the puttable financial instrument.</p></body></paragraph>
