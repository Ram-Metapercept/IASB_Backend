<paragraph id="IAS32_BC67" base="F5588835"><paranum>BC67</paranum><prolog><data name="standard_number" value="IAS 32"/><data name="paranum" value="BC67"/></prolog><body><p id="IAS32_P2277">The Board decided that an exception to the definition of a financial liability should be made for instruments that entitle the holder to a pro rata share of the net assets of an entity only on liquidation if particular requirements are met. Many of those requirements, and the reasons for them, are similar to those for puttable financial instruments. The differences between the requirements are as follows:</p><ol id="IAS32_L0068" base="F5588837" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IAS32_P2278" base="F5588838">there is no requirement that there be no other contractual obligations;</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IAS32_P2279" base="F5588840">there is no requirement to consider the expected total cash flows throughout the life of the instrument;</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IAS32_P2280" base="F5588842">the only feature that must be identical among the instruments in the class is the obligation for the issuing entity to deliver to the holder a pro rata share of its net assets on liquidation.</p></li></ol><p id="IAS32_P2281" base="F5588843">The reason for the differences is the timing of settlement of the obligation. The life of the financial instrument is the same as the life of the issuing entity; the extinguishment of the obligation can occur only at liquidation. Therefore, the Board concluded that it was appropriate to focus only on the obligations that exist at liquidation. The instrument must be subordinate to all other classes of instruments and represent the residual interests only at that point in time. However, if the instrument contains other contractual obligations, those obligations may need to be accounted for separately in accordance with the requirements of IAS 32.</p></body></paragraph>
