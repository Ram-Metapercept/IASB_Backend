It is more a matter of form than a matter of substance that both liabilities and equity interests are created by a single financial instrument rather than two or more separate instruments. The Board believes that an entity&#x2019;s financial position is more faithfully represented by separate presentation of liability and equity components contained in a single instrument.</p></body></paragraph>
