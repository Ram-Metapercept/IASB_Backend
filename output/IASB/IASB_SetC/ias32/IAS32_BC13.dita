<paragraph id="IAS32_BC13" base="SL31458"><paranum>BC13</paranum><prolog><data name="standard_number" value="IAS 32"/><data name="paranum" value="BC13"/></prolog><body><p id="IAS32_P2163">The Board agreed that it would be inappropriate to account for a contract as an equity instrument when an entity&#x2019;s own equity instruments are used as currency in a contract to receive or deliver a variable number of shares whose value equals a fixed amount or an amount based on changes in an underlying variable (eg a net share&#x2011;settled derivative contract on gold or an obligation to deliver as many shares as are equal in value to CU10,000). Such a contract represents a right or obligation of a specified amount rather than a specified equity interest. A contract to pay or receive a specified amount (rather than a specified equity interest) is not an equity instrument. For such a contract, the entity does not know, before the transaction is settled, how many of its own shares (or how much cash) it will receive or deliver and the entity may not even know whether it will receive or deliver its own shares.</p></body></paragraph>
