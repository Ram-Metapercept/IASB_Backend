Systems that meet the principle in <xref id="IAS32_X1113" base="F17327829" href="IAS32_AG38F.dita#IAS32_AG38F">paragraph AG38F</xref> of IAS 32 may be referred to by different names in different jurisdictions. Referring to specific types of settlement systems may exclude other systems that are also considered equivalent to net settlement. In addition, the Board did not want to imply that settlement through specific systems would always meet the net settlement criterion. Entities must determine whether a system meets the principle in <xref id="IAS32_X1114" base="F17327830" href="IAS32_AG38F.dita#IAS32_AG38F">paragraph AG38F</xref> of IAS 32 by determining whether or not the system eliminates or results in insignificant credit and liquidity risk and processes receivables and payables in the same settlement process or cycle.</p></body></paragraph>
