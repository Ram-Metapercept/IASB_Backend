In this respect, the Board observed that the income tax consequences of distributions to holders of an equity instrument are recognised in profit or loss in accordance with <xref base="F67035150" keyref="IAS12_52B" id="IAS32_X1061" href="../ias12/IAS12_52B_DELETED.dita" scope="peer">paragraph 52B of IAS 12</xref>. Consequently, to the extent that the distribution relates to income arising from a transaction that was originally recognised in profit or loss, the income tax on the distribution should be recognised in profit or loss. However, if the distribution relates to income or to a transaction that was originally recognised in other comprehensive income or equity, the entity should apply the exception in <xref base="F67035151" href="../ias12/IAS12_58.dita#IAS12_58" id="IAS32_X1062">paragraph 58(a) of IAS 12</xref>, and recognise the income tax consequences of the distribution outside of profit or loss. The Board also observed that, in accordance with paragraph 65A, when an entity pays dividends to its shareholders the portion of the dividends paid or payable to taxation authorities as withholding tax is charged to equity as part of the dividends.<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS32_FN0050" type="fn"/></p>     </variant></body></paragraph>
