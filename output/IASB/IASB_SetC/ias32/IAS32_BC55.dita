The proposals represented a limited scope exception to the definition of a financial liability and a short&#x2011;term solution, pending the outcome of the longer&#x2011;term project on liabilities and equity. In June 2006 the Board published an exposure draft proposing that financial instruments puttable at fair value that meet specific criteria should be classified as equity.</p></body></paragraph>
