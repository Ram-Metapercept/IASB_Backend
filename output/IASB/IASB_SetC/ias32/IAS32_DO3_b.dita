Mr Smith believes that these concerns are well&#x2011;founded because there is no limitation on what qualifies as a class of equity. Without some limitation, an entity could, for example, establish a foreign currency trading subsidiary, issue shares to a non&#x2011;controlling interest and deem the shares to be a class of equity in the consolidated group.</p></body></paragraph>
