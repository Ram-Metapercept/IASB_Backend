If the liability component of a compound financial instrument is classified as at fair value through profit or loss, an entity could recognise an immediate gain or loss after initial recognition if it applies a relative fair value method. This is contrary to <xref base="F19795867" href="IAS32_31.dita#IAS32_31" id="IAS32_X1026">IAS 32, paragraph 31</xref>, which states that no gain or loss arises from recognising the components of the instrument separately.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
