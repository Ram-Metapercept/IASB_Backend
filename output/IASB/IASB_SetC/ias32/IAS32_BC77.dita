However, the boards noted that requiring common disclosures of gross and net information would be helpful for users of financial statements. Accordingly, the boards agreed on common disclosure requirements by amending and finalising the disclosures that were initially proposed in the exposure draft. The amendments <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Disclosures&#x2014;Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities</ph></ph> (Amendments to <xref base="F17327270" href="../ifrs07/IFRS07_TOC.dita#IFRS07_TOC0001" id="IAS32_X1084">IFRS 7</xref>) were issued in December 2011.</p></body></paragraph>
