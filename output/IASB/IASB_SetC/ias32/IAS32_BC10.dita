In other words, when a contract is settled in a variable number           of the entity&#x2019;s own equity instruments,  or by           the entity exchanging a fixed number of its own equity instruments for a variable amount           of cash or another financial asset,  the contract is not an equity instrument but is a           financial asset or a financial liability.</p>                </li></ol></body></paragraph>
