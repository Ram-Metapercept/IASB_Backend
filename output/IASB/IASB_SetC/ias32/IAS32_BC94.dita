The amount resulting from offsetting must also reflect the entity&#x2019;s expected future cash flows from settling two or more separate financial instruments. This is consistent with the principle in <xref id="IAS32_X1107" base="F17327792" href="IAS32_43.dita#IAS32_43">paragraph 43</xref> of IAS 32.</p></body></paragraph>
