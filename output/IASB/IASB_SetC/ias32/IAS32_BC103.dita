The Board confirmed that a recognised financial instrument referred to as collateral should be set off against the related financial asset or financial liability in the statement of financial position if, and only if, it meets the offsetting criteria in <xref id="IAS32_X1116" base="F19320795" href="IAS32_42.dita#IAS32_42/IAS32_42_V2">paragraph 42</xref> of IAS 32. The Board also noted that if an entity can be required to return or receive back collateral, the entity would not currently have a legally enforceable right of set&#x2011;off in all of the following circumstances: in the normal course of business, the event of default and the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of one of the counterparties.</p></body></paragraph>
