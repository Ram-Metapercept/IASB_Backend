The Board rejected this argument because of the extremely narrow amendment that requires the entity to treat all of its existing owners of the same class of its own non&#x2011;derivative equity instruments equally. The Board also noted that a change in the capital structure of an entity to create a new class of non&#x2011;derivative equity instruments would be transparent because of the presentation and disclosure requirements in IFRSs.</p></body></paragraph>
