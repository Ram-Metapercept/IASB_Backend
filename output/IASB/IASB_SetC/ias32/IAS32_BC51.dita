The Board also agreed with constituents that additional disclosures and adapting the format of the entity&#x2019;s financial statements did not resolve the problem of the lack of relevance and understandability of that current accounting treatment. Therefore, the Board decided to amend IAS 32 to improve the financial reporting of these instruments.</p></body></paragraph>
