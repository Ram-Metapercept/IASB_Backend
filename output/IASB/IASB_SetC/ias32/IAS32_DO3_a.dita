First, the Board has an active project on the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework,</ph></ph> which will revisit the definition of a liability. Although these Board members agree that standards projects can precede decisions in the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph> project, the discussions to date in the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph> project do not make it clear that the Board will modify the existing elements definitions in such a way that these instruments would be equity. Second, the amendments would require disclosure of the expected cash outflow on redemption or repurchase of puttable instruments classified as equity. These disclosures are similar to those for financial liabilities; existing standards do not require similar disclosure for equity instruments. The Board&#x2019;s decision to require these disclosures reveals its implicit view these instruments are, in fact, liabilities. Yet, the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph> is clear that disclosure is not a substitute for recognition. Third, these Board members see no cost&#x2011;benefit or practical reasons for making this exception. The amendments require the same or similar information to be obtained and disclosed as would be the case if these obligations were classified as liabilities. Existing standards offer presentation alternatives for entities that have no equity under the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph>&#x2019;s definitions.</p></body></paragraph>
