In addition, the Board did not consider that the effective date needed to be aligned with that of <xref base="F70390850" href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_TOC.dita#IFRS09_TOC0001" id="IAS32_X1124">IFRS 9</xref>. However, the Board also understood the concerns of preparers. The Board therefore decided to require the amendments to the IAS 32 application guidance to be effective for periods beginning 1 January 2014 with earlier application permitted. This would provide a balance between the time needed to implement the amendments with the need for consistent application of the IAS 32 offsetting requirements.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
