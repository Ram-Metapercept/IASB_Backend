Laws or regulations in many jurisdictions throughout the world require the use of rights issues when raising capital. The entity issues one or more rights to acquire a fixed number of additional shares pro rata to all existing shareholders of a class of non&#x2011;derivative equity instruments. The exercise price is normally below the current market price of the shares.

Issues with those characteristics are discussed in <xref base="F16453314" href="../ifrs02/IFRS02_TOC.dita#IFRS02_TOC0001" id="IAS32_X0959">IFRS 2 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Share&#x2011;based Payment</ph></ph></xref> and <xref base="F16453315" href="../ias33/IAS33_TOC.dita#IAS33_TOC0001" id="IAS32_X0960">IAS 33 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Earnings per Share</ph></ph></xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
