An example is a monetary item denominated in a currency that is more readily convertible than the local domestic currency of the foreign operation.</p>       </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>         <p id="IAS21_P0225" base="SL171604">An investment in a foreign operation denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency of the reporting entity or the foreign operation does not expose the group to a greater foreign currency exchange difference than arises when the investment is denominated in the functional currency of the reporting entity or the foreign operation. It simply results in exchange differences arising in the foreign operation&#x2019;s individual financial statements and the reporting entity&#x2019;s separate financial statements.</p>       </li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value>         <p id="IAS21_P0226" base="SL171606">It is not clear whether the term &#x2018;reporting entity&#x2019; in <xref id="IAS21_X0221" base="F16452917" href="IAS21_32.dita#IAS21_32">paragraph 32</xref> should be interpreted as the single entity or the group comprising a parent and all its subsidiaries. As a result, constituents questioned whether the monetary item must be transacted between the foreign operation and the reporting entity, or whether it could be transacted between the foreign operation and any member of the consolidated group, ie the reporting entity or any of its subsidiaries.</p>       </li></ol></body></paragraph>
