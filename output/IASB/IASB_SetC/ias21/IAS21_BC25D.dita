Therefore, the principle in <xref id="IAS21_X0223" base="F16452918" href="IAS21_32.dita#IAS21_32">paragraph 32</xref> to recognise exchange differences arising on a monetary item initially in a separate component of equity effectively results in the monetary item being accounted for in the same way as an equity investment in the foreign operation when consolidated financial statements are prepared. The Board concluded that the accounting treatment in the consolidated financial statements should not be dependent on the currency in which the monetary item is denominated, nor on which entity within the group conducts the transaction with the foreign operation.</p></body></paragraph>
