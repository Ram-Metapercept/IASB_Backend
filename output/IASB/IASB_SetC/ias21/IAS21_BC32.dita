Entities follow the requirements in <xref id="IAS21_X0228" base="F16452956" href="../ias36/IAS36_TOC0001.dita#IAS36_TOC0001">IAS 36 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Impairment of Assets</ph></ph></xref> to determine the level at which goodwill is tested for impairment.</p></body></paragraph>
