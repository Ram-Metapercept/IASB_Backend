The cost method required an entity to recognise distributions as income only if they came from post&#x2011;acquisition retained earnings. Distributions received in excess of such profits were regarded as a recovery of the investment and were recognised as a reduction of its cost. Consequently, the Board amended paragraph 49 to remove the reference to pre&#x2011;acquisition profits and to clarify that a dividend accounted for in accordance with paragraph 38A of IAS 27 cannot be a disposal or partial disposal of a net investment in IAS 21.<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS21_FN0017" type="fn"/></p></body></paragraph>
