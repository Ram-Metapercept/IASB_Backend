Respondents to the exposure draft disagreed with this proposal. Many respondents said that the proposed amendment added a detailed rule that was not required because the principle in <xref id="IAS21_X0224" base="F16452922" href="IAS21_15.dita#IAS21_15">paragraph 15</xref> was clear. In redeliberations, the Board agreed with those comments and decided not to proceed with that proposed amendment.</p></body></paragraph>
