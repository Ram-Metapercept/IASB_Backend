The amendment requires exchange differences arising on a monetary item that forms part of a reporting entity&#x2019;s net investment in a foreign operation to be recognised initially in a separate component of equity in the consolidated financial statements. This requirement applies irrespective of the currency of the monetary item and of whether the monetary item results from a transaction with the reporting entity or any of its subsidiaries.</p></body></paragraph>
