Moreover, recognition of exchange losses as an asset is neither allowed nor required by any liaison standard&#x2011;setter, so its deletion would improve convergence. Finally, in many cases when the conditions for recognition as an asset are met, the asset would be restated in accordance with <xref id="IAS21_X0216" base="F75165639" href="../ias29/IAS29_TOC0001.dita#IAS29_TOC0001">IAS 29 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies</ph></ph></xref>. Thus, to the extent that an exchange loss reflects hyperinflation, this effect is taken into account by <xref id="IAS21_X0217" base="F75165641" href="../ias29/IAS29_TOC0001.dita#IAS29_TOC0001">IAS 29</xref>. For all of these reasons, the Board removed the allowed alternative treatment and the related SIC Interpretation is superseded.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
