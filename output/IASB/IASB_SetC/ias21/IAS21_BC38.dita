However, in this instance, both investments (ie the joint venture and the associate) continue to be measured using the equity method. Considering that there is neither a change in the group boundaries nor a change in the measurement requirements, the Board concluded that losing joint control and retaining significant influence is not an event that warrants remeasurement of the retained interest at fair value.</p></body></paragraph>
