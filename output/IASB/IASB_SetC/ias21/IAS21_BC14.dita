Such a &#x2018;convenience translation&#x2019; may display financial statements (or selected portions of financial statements) in a currency other than the presentation currency, as a convenience to some users. The &#x2018;convenience translation&#x2019; may be prepared using a translation method other than that required by the Standard. These types of &#x2018;convenience translations&#x2019; should be clearly identified as supplementary information to distinguish them from information required by IFRSs and translated in accordance with the Standard.</p></body></paragraph>
