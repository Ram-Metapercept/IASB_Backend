In particular, some believed that SIC&#x2011;19 placed too much emphasis on the currency in which transactions are denominated and too little emphasis on the underlying economy that determines the pricing of those transactions. To meet these concerns, the Board defined functional currency as &#x2018;the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates&#x2019;. The Board also provided guidance on how to determine the functional currency (see <xref base="F16452839" href="IAS21_g9-14.dita#IAS21_g9-14" id="IAS21_X0204">paragraphs 9&#x2013;14</xref> of the Standard). This guidance draws heavily on SIC&#x2011;19 and equivalent guidance in US and other national standards, but also reflects the Board&#x2019;s decision that some factors merit greater emphasis than others.</p></body></paragraph>
