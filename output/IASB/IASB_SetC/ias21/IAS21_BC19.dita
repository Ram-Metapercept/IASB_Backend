As noted above, many large groups do not have a single functional currency, but comprise operations with a number of functional currencies. For such entities it is not clear which functional currency should be chosen in which to express amounts before they are translated into the presentation currency, or why one currency is preferable to another. In addition, this method produces the same amounts in the presentation currency for a stand&#x2011;alone entity as for an identical subsidiary of a parent whose functional currency is the presentation currency.</p></body></paragraph>
