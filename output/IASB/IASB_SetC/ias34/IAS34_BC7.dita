The submitter noted that the definition of &#x2018;interim financial report&#x2019; in paragraph 4 of IAS 34 was not sufficiently clear with respect to whether the interim financial report covers only the information reported under IFRS (meaning the IFRS interim financial statements) or whether it also includes management reports or other elements in addition to IFRS interim financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
