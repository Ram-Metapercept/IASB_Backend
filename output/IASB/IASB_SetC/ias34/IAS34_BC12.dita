The term &#x2018;balance sheet&#x2019; had been replaced in IFRS Standards following the revision of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 1</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Presentation of Financial Statements</ph></ph> in 2007. However, paragraphs 31 and 33 of IAS 34 had not been amended then because the term was part of direct quotations from the <i>Framework</i>. Upon issuing the 2018 <i>Conceptual Framework</i>, the Board replaced the term &#x2018;balance sheet&#x2019; in those paragraphs so that the terminology used in the 2018 <i>Conceptual Framework</i> and in IFRS Standards is consistent.</p></body></paragraph>
