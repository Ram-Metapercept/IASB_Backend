IAS 34 was issued by the Board&#x2019;s predecessor body, IASC, in 1998. In the light of recent improvements to disclosure requirements, many users of financial statements asked the Board to consider whether particular disclosures required by <xref base="F14540507" href="../ifrs07/IFRS07_TOC.dita#IFRS07_TOC0001" id="IAS34_X0317">IFRS 7 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Financial Instruments: Disclosures</ph></ph></xref> for annual financial statements should also be required in interim financial statements. IAS 34 sets out disclosure principles to determine what information should be disclosed in an interim financial report. The Board concluded that amending IAS 34 to place greater emphasis on those principles and the inclusion of additional examples relating to more recent disclosure requirements, ie fair value measurements, would improve interim financial reporting.</p></body></paragraph>
