In IAS 34, that document replaced references in paragraphs 31 and 33 to the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements</ph></ph> adopted by the Board in 2001 (<i>Framework</i>) with references to the 2018 <i>Conceptual Framework</i>, and updated a related quotation. The Board does not expect that replacement to have a significant effect on the application of the Standard because the Board made no significant changes to the aspects of recognition that those paragraphs refer to&#x2014;that is, the importance of definitions for recognition.</p></body></paragraph>
