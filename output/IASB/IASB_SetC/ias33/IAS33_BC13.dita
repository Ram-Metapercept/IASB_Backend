However, <xref id="IAS33_X0295" base="F16144691" href="../ias34/IAS34_TOC0001.dita#IAS34_TOC0001">IAS 34</xref> states that, &#x2018;This Standard does not mandate which entities should be required to publish interim financial reports, how frequently, or how soon after the end of an interim period.&#x2019; The frequency of interim reporting is mandated by securities regulators, stock exchanges, governments, and accountancy bodies, and varies by jurisdiction.</p></body></paragraph>
