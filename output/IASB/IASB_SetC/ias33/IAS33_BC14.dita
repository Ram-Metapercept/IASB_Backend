The US Financial Accounting Standards Board has agreed to consider this difference as part of the joint short&#x2011;term convergence project with the IASB as well as the issue noted in <xref id="IAS33_X0297" base="F16144693" href="IAS33_BC9.dita#IAS33_BC9">paragraph BC9</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
