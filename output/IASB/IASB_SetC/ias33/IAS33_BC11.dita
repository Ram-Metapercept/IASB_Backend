The most significant argument against the proposed approach was that the proposed calculation of diluted earnings per share could result in an amount for year&#x2011;to&#x2011;date diluted earnings per share that was different for entities that report more frequently, for example, on a quarterly or half&#x2011;yearly basis, and for entities that report only annually. It was also noted that this problem would be exacerbated for entities with seasonal businesses.</p></body></paragraph>
