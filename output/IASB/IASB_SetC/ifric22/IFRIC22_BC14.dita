Consequently, the question about which exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income arises only when the advance consideration gives rise to the recognition of a non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability. Accordingly, the Interpretations Committee decided that this Interpretation applies only in circumstances in which an entity recognises a non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from advance consideration.</p></body></paragraph>
