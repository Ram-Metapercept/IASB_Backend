The Interpretations Committee decided it was not necessary to clarify this matter in the Interpretation. The Interpretation Committee noted that <xref base="F60693819" href="../ias21/IAS21_24.dita#IAS21_24" id="IFRIC22_X0090">paragraph 24 of IAS 21</xref> requires an entity to determine the carrying amount of an item in conjunction with other relevant Standards. Consequently, an entity first evaluates transactions for embedded derivatives that require separation at contract inception before applying the requirements in <xref base="F60693821" href="../ias21/IAS21_TOC.dita#IAS21_TOC0001" id="IFRIC22_X0091">IAS 21</xref> or this Interpretation.</p></body></paragraph>
