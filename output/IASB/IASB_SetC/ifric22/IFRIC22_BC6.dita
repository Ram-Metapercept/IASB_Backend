Consequently, the Interpretations Committee decided that the Interpretation applies to a foreign currency transaction (or part of it) when an entity recognises a non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from the payment or receipt of advance consideration. Respondents to the draft Interpretation generally supported the scope proposed by the Interpretations Committee.</p></body></paragraph>
