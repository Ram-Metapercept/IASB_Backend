This is because the Interpretation addresses only how to determine the &#x2018;date of the transaction&#x2019; for the purpose of determining the exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income on the derecognition of a non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from advance consideration in a foreign currency.</p></body></paragraph>
