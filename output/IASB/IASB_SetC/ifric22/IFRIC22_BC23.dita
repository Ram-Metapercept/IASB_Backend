The Interpretations Committee observed that <ph>paragraph 4.46 of the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph></ph> notes that &#x2018;in practice, obligations under contracts that are equally proportionately unperformed (for example, liabilities for inventory ordered but not yet received) are generally not recognised as liabilities in the financial statements&#x2019;. Consequently, the Interpretations Committee concluded the date on which an entity first recognises the transaction in its financial statements with a value determines the date of the transaction. If an entity recognises a non&#x2011;monetary asset or non&#x2011;monetary liability arising from advance consideration, the date of initial recognition of that asset or liability is the date of the transaction. The date of initial recognition of the non&#x2011;monetary asset or non&#x2011;monetary liability is generally the date on which the entity pays or receives the advance consideration.</p></body></paragraph>
