In that case, applying this Interpretation, an entity determines the date of the transaction for only that part of the related asset, expense or income for which consideration has been received or paid in advance. If there are subsequent advance payments or receipts, the date(s) of the transaction for the remaining part(s) of the related asset, expense or income will be the date(s) on which the entity recognises those subsequent advance receipts or payments. Correspondingly, if part of the consideration is paid in arrears, the date(s) of the transaction for the remaining part(s) of the related asset, expense or income will be the date(s) on which the entity initially recognises that (those) part(s) of the asset, expense or income in its financial statements applying applicable Standards.</p></body></paragraph>
