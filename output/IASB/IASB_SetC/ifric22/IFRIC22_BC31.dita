Consequently, the Interpretations Committee decided that, on initial application, entities should have the option not to retrospectively adjust assets, expenses and income (or parts of them) that had been recognised before the beginning of the reporting period in which the Interpretation is first applied or the beginning of a prior reporting period presented as comparative information in the period in which the Interpretation is first applied. </p></body></paragraph>
