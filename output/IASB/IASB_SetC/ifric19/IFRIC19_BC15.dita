No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of an entity&#x2019;s own equity instruments.

For equity&#x2011;settled share&#x2011;based payment transactions, the entity measures the goods or services received, and the corresponding increase in equity, directly, at the fair value of the goods or services received, unless that fair value cannot be estimated reliably. If the entity cannot estimate reliably the fair value of the goods or services received (eg transactions with employees), the entity measures their value, and the corresponding increase in equity, indirectly, by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.</p></li><li><li_value>(d)</li_value> <p base="F12558242" id="IFRIC19_P0105"><i>consideration transferred in business combinations</i> (<xref base="SL13816703" href="../ifrs03/IFRS03_TOC.dita#IFRS03_TOC0001" id="IFRIC19_X0097">IFRS 3</xref>). The total consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value. It includes the acquisition&#x2011;date fair values of any equity interests issued by the acquirer.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
