The IFRIC noted that <xref base="SL13816873" href="../ias08/IAS08_TOC.dita#IAS08_TOC0001" id="IFRIC19_X0134">IAS 8 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors</ph></ph></xref> provides guidance on circumstances in which retrospective application might be impracticable. The IFRIC concluded that it was preferable to require entities that could apply the Interpretation retrospectively to do so, rather than requiring all entities to apply it prospectively to future transactions. However, to simplify transition, the IFRIC also concluded that it should require retrospective application only from the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented because application to earlier periods would result only in a reclassification of amounts within equity.</p></body></paragraph>
