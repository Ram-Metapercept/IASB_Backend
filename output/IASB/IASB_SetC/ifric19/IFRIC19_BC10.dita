Paragraph 41 of IAS 39<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRIC19_FN0005" type="fn"/> requires an entity to recognise in profit or loss the difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability extinguished and the consideration paid. That paragraph describes &#x2018;consideration paid&#x2019; as including non&#x2011;cash assets transferred, or liabilities assumed, and does not specifically mention equity instruments issued. Consequently, some are of the view that equity instruments are not &#x2018;consideration paid&#x2019;.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
