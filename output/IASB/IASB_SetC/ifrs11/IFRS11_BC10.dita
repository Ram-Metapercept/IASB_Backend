Applying the same accounting treatment to all the interests that an entity has in different jointly controlled entities might not always lead to the faithful representation of each of those interests. For example, an entity whose policy was to account for all of its interests in jointly controlled entities using proportionate consolidation might have recognised assets and liabilities proportionately even though this did not faithfully represent the entity&#x2019;s rights and obligations in the assets and liabilities of particular joint arrangements. Conversely, an entity might have accounted for all of its interests in jointly controlled entities using the equity method, when the recognition of the entity&#x2019;s rights and obligations in particular joint arrangements would instead have led to the recognition of assets and liabilities.</p></body></paragraph>
