This is the principle that IFRS 11 establishes for parties to a joint arrangement when accounting for their interests in the arrangements. However, the Board acknowledges that sometimes the structure or the legal form of the joint arrangements is decisive in determining the parties&#x2019; rights and obligations arising from the arrangements and, consequently, in determining the classification of the joint arrangements (see <xref id="IFRS11_X0420" base="F16217405" href="IFRS11_BC26.dita#IFRS11_BC26">paragraphs BC26</xref> and <xref id="IFRS11_X0421" base="F16217404" href="IFRS11_BC31.dita#IFRS11_BC31">BC31</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
