The IASB noted that IFRS already provides guidance for the acquisition of an interest in an asset or a group of assets that is not a business, as defined in IFRS 3. Consequently, the amendments apply only when an entity acquires an interest in a joint operation in which the activity constitutes a business, as defined in IFRS 3, either on formation of that joint operation or when acquiring an interest in an existing joint operation. </p></body></paragraph>
