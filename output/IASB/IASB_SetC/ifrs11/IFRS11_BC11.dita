The Board concluded that proportionate consolidation is not an appropriate method to account for interests in joint arrangements when the parties have neither rights to the assets, nor obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. The Board also concluded that the equity method is not an appropriate method to account for interests in joint arrangements when parties have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. The Board believes that it is misleading for users of financial statements if an entity recognises assets and liabilities for which it does not have rights or obligations, or does not recognise assets and liabilities for which it does have rights and obligations.</p></body></paragraph>
