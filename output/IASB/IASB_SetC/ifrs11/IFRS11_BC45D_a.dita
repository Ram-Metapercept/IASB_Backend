The IASB was concerned that this diversity in practice may continue in the accounting for acquisitions of interests in joint operations, as defined in IFRS 11, when the activities of those joint operations constitute businesses. Arrangements that were formerly &#x2018;jointly controlled operations&#x2019; and &#x2018;jointly controlled assets&#x2019; in IAS 31 are joint operations in IFRS 11 (see paragraph BC26). As was the case in IAS 31, a joint operator recognises its (share in the) assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses relating to such arrangements.</p></body></paragraph>
