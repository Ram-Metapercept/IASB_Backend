In such a case, an entity should assess whether it has legal or constructive obligations in relation to those negative net assets. The Board concluded that if the entity does not have legal or constructive obligations in relation to the negative net assets, it should not recognise the corresponding liability but it should adjust retained earnings at the beginning of the earliest period presented. The entity should also be required to disclose this fact along with its cumulative unrecognised share of losses of the joint venture as at the beginning of the earliest period presented and at the date at which the IFRS is first applied.</p></body></paragraph>
