In the first case, the Board noted that assets and liabilities recognised could be higher than the investment derecognised when the entity had previously impaired the carrying amount of the investment. The Board observed that, in accordance with <xref base="F16217821" href="../ias28/IAS28_TOC.dita#IAS28_TOC0001" id="IFRS11_X0522">IAS 28</xref> (as amended in 2011), such an impairment loss would not have been allocated to any asset, including goodwill, that formed part of the carrying amount of the investment and that as a result, the net amount of the underlying assets and liabilities could be higher than the carrying amount of the investment. To address this, the Board concluded that in such a case, an entity should first adjust the difference against any goodwill related to the investment, with any remaining difference adjusted against retained earnings at the beginning of the earliest period presented. In the second case, the Board noted that the net amount of the assets and liabilities recognised could be lower than the investment derecognised when, for example, an entity applied the same percentage interest to all the underlying assets and liabilities of its investee when determining the carrying amount of its investment using the equity method. However, for some of those underlying assets the entity could have a lower interest when accounting for it as a joint operation. The Board concluded that in such a case, an entity should adjust any difference between the net amount of the assets and liabilities recognised and the investment (and any other items that formed part of the entity&#x2019;s net investment in the arrangement) derecognised against retained earnings at the beginning of the earliest period presented.</p></body></paragraph>
