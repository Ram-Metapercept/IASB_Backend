First, verifiability and understandability are enhanced because the accounting reflects more faithfully the economic phenomena that it purports to represent (ie an entity&#x2019;s rights and obligations arising from its arrangements), which allows them to be better understood. Second, requiring the same accounting for each type of arrangement will enable entities to account for joint arrangements consistently: arrangements that confer on the parties rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities are joint operations and arrangements that confer on the parties rights to the net assets are joint ventures. Consistency in the accounting for joint arrangements will help to achieve comparability among financial statements, which will enable users to identify and understand similarities in, and differences between, different arrangements.</p></body></paragraph>
