The requirements for the disclosure of an entity&#x2019;s interest in joint arrangements have been included in <xref base="F16217402" href="../ifrs12/IFRS12_TOC.dita#IFRS12_TOC0001" id="IFRS11_X0418">IFRS 12 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities</ph></ph></xref> (see <xref base="F16217403" href="IFRS11_gBC52-BC55.dita#IFRS11_gBC52-BC55" id="IFRS11_X0419">paragraphs BC52&#x2013;BC55</xref>). IFRS 11 is concerned principally with addressing two aspects of IAS 31 that the Board regarded as impediments to high quality reporting of joint arrangements: first, that the structure of the arrangement was the only determinant of the accounting, and second, that an entity had a choice of accounting treatment for interests in jointly controlled entities.</p></body></paragraph>
