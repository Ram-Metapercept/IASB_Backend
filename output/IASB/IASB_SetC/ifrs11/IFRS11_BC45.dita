This is because the disclosure requirements in <xref base="F16217601" href="../ifrs12/IFRS12_TOC.dita#IFRS12_TOC0001" id="IFRS11_X0462">IFRS 12</xref>, when compared with IAS 31, will improve the quality of the information provided to users relating to an entity&#x2019;s interest in joint ventures. The disclosure requirements in IFRS 12 will provide users with information about individual joint ventures when those joint ventures are material to the reporting entity. In addition, the Board notes that the summarised financial information required in IFRS 12 results in a higher degree of detail than did IAS 31, which gives users a better basis for assessing the effect on the reporting entity of the activities carried out through joint ventures.</p></body></paragraph>
