The Board concluded that once an entity has determined the classification of the arrangement, the accounting for the arrangement will follow accounting procedures that have not been modified by the IFRS (ie entities will either account for assets and liabilities or they will account for an investment using the equity method). However, the Board acknowledged that the requirement for joint operations to be accounted for in the same way in the entity&#x2019;s consolidated financial statements as in the entity&#x2019;s separate financial statements might lead to additional costs to entities in jurisdictions in which separate financial statements are required to be reported in accordance with IFRSs. This is because those requirements might cause entities to perform additional manual procedures such as reconciliations between the statutory accounts and the tax returns, and might require an entity to provide additional explanations of the impact of the changes to, for example, its creditors. Except for these costs and any other costs required on transition, the costs of accounting for joint arrangements once the entities have determined their classification will remain unchanged as a result of the IFRS.</p></body></paragraph>
