Jointly controlled operations and jointly controlled assets were arrangements that did not require the establishment of an entity or financial structure that is separate from the parties. IAS 31 required parties to these arrangements to recognise assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses arising from the arrangements. When arrangements were structured through an entity, IAS 31 classified them as jointly controlled entities. Parties with interests in jointly controlled entities accounted for them using proportionate consolidation or, as an alternative, the equity method.</p></body></paragraph>
