The Board believes that accounting for joint arrangements that is based on the principles of the IFRS will contribute not only to improving the faithful representation of an entity&#x2019;s interests in joint arrangements, but also to enhancing comparability. This is because arrangements in which the parties have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities will require the same accounting treatment. In the same way, arrangements in which the parties have rights to the net assets of the arrangement will also require the same accounting treatment.</p></body></paragraph>
