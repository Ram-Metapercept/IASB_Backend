As stated in <xref base="F16217822" href="IFRS11_BC38.dita#IFRS11_BC38" id="IFRS11_X0525">paragraph BC38</xref>, the Board observed that the parties&#x2019; interests in a joint operation are recognised in their separate financial statements, resulting in no difference between what is recognised in the parties&#x2019; separate financial statements and in the parties&#x2019; consolidated financial statements. The Board decided that an entity should adjust any difference between the investment derecognised and the assets and liabilities recognised in respect of the entity&#x2019;s interest in a joint operation against retained earnings at the beginning of the earliest period presented.</p></body></paragraph>
