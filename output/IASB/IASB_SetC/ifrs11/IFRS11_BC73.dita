This is because the accounting for joint arrangements in the IFRS follows a principle-based approach. This approach has allowed the Board to remove the accounting option in IAS 31 so that each type of joint arrangement (ie &#x2018;joint operations&#x2019; and &#x2018;joint ventures&#x2019;) is accounted for on a consistent basis. This contributes to enhancing the verifiability,                     comparability                     and understandability                     of these arrangements in entities&#x2019; financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
