As noted in <xref id="IFRS11_X0429" base="F16217467" href="IFRS11_BC13.dita#IFRS11_BC13">paragraph BC13</xref>, the IFRS does not change the two essential characteristics that IAS 31 required for arrangements to be &#x2018;joint ventures&#x2019;: a contractual arrangement that binds the parties to the arrangement exists, and the contractual arrangement establishes that two or more of those parties have joint control of the arrangement. </p></body></paragraph>
