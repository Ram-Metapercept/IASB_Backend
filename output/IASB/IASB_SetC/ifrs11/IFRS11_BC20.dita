Some respondents questioned how &#x2018;shared decision-making&#x2019; was intended to operate and how it differed from &#x2018;joint control&#x2019;. The Board introduced the term &#x2018;shared decision-making&#x2019; in the exposure draft instead of &#x2018;joint control&#x2019; because control was defined in <xref id="IFRS11_X0433" base="F16217468" href="../ias27/IAS27_TOC0001.dita#IAS27_TOC0001">IAS 27 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements</ph></ph></xref> in the context of having power over the financial and operating policies of an entity.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS11_FN0015" type="fn"/> During its redeliberation of ED 9, the Board concluded that in joint arrangements, it is the activity undertaken by the parties that is the matter over which the parties share control or share decision-making, regardless of whether the activity is conducted in a separate entity. Consequently, the Board concluded that &#x2018;joint control&#x2019; is a term that expresses better than &#x2018;shared decision-making&#x2019; that the control of the activity that is the subject matter of the arrangement is shared among the parties with joint control of the arrangement.</p></body></paragraph>
