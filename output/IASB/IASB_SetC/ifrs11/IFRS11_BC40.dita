The Board observed that ED 9 had not been intended to change this aspect of IAS 31, where the &#x2018;share&#x2019; is determined in accordance with the contractual arrangement. The Board concluded that the contractual arrangement generally delineates the &#x2018;share&#x2019; or &#x2018;part&#x2019; not only of the assets or liabilities of the parties to joint operations, but also of their &#x2018;share&#x2019; of any revenues and expenses arising from the joint operation.</p></body></paragraph>
