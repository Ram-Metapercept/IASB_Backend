Many respondents to ED 9 were not clear whether parties to a joint operation that had rights to the assets should recognise a &#x2018;right to use&#x2019; or a &#x2018;right to a share&#x2019; or whether they should instead directly recognise &#x2018;their share of the joint assets, classified according to the nature of the asset&#x2019;. The concern raised by this uncertainty was the different accounting implications of these interpretations&#x2014;ie accounting for rights or accounting for shares of assets. The Board concluded that a party to a joint operation should recognise its assets or its share of any assets in accordance with the IFRSs applicable to the particular assets.</p></body></paragraph>
