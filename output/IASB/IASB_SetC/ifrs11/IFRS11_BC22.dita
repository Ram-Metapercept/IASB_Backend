Indeed, some of the parties to a joint arrangement can have joint control whereas others, although able to participate, do not have joint control of the arrangement.  The Board decided to use the terms &#x2018;joint operators&#x2019; to designate parties with joint control of a &#x2018;joint operation&#x2019; and &#x2018;joint venturers&#x2019; to designate parties with joint control of a &#x2018;joint venture&#x2019; (see <xref id="IFRS11_X0437" base="F16217472" href="IFRS11_BC24.dita#IFRS11_BC24">paragraph BC24</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
