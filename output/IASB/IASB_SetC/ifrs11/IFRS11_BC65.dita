The Board decided to require an entity to recognise each of the assets, including any goodwill arising from acquisition, and the liabilities relating to its interest in the joint operation at its carrying amount on the basis of the information used by the entity in applying the equity method, instead of requiring the entity to remeasure its share of each of those assets and liabilities at the date of transition. The Board did not believe that the costs of requiring entities to remeasure the assets and liabilities relating to the joint operation as a result of the accounting change would outweigh the benefits.</p></body></paragraph>
