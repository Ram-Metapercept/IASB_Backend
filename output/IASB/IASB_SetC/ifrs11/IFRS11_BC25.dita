ED 9 proposed to classify joint arrangements into three types&#x2014;&#x2018;joint operations&#x2019;, &#x2018;joint assets&#x2019; and &#x2018;joint ventures&#x2019;. The Board observed that in some instances it might be difficult to assess whether an arrangement is a &#x2018;joint operation&#x2019; or a &#x2018;joint asset&#x2019;. This is because elements from both types of joint arrangement are sometimes present (in many arrangements joint assets are also jointly operated, and therefore such arrangements could be viewed as a &#x2018;joint asset&#x2019; or as a &#x2018;joint operation&#x2019;). Additionally, both types of joint arrangement result in the same accounting outcome (ie recognition of assets and liabilities and corresponding revenues and expenses). For these reasons, the Board decided to merge &#x2018;joint operations&#x2019; and &#x2018;joint assets&#x2019; into a single type of joint arrangement called &#x2018;joint operation&#x2019;.  This decision simplifies the IFRS by aligning the two types of joint arrangement presented by the IFRS (ie &#x2018;joint operations&#x2019; and &#x2018;joint ventures&#x2019;) with the two possible accounting outcomes (ie recognition of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, or recognition of an investment accounted for using the equity method).</p></body></paragraph>
