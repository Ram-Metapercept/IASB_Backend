The Board noted that there are two main differences between recognising assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses relating to the activity of the joint operation and proportionate consolidation. The first difference relates to the fact that the rights and obligations, as specified in the contractual arrangement, that an entity has with respect to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses relating to a joint operation might differ from its ownership interest in the joint operation. The IFRS requires an entity with an interest in a joint operation to recognise assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses according to the entity&#x2019;s shares in the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the joint operation as determined and specified in the contractual arrangement, rather than basing the recognition of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses on the ownership interest that the entity has in the joint operation. The second difference from proportionate consolidation is that the parties&#x2019; interests in a joint operation are recognised in their separate financial statements. Consequently, there is no difference in what is recognised in the parties&#x2019; separate financial statements and the parties&#x2019; consolidated financial statements or the parties&#x2019; financial statements in which investments are accounted for using the equity method.</p></body></paragraph>
