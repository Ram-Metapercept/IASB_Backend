This was consistent with IAS 31, which defined an &#x2018;investor in a joint venture&#x2019; as a party to a joint venture that does not have joint control of that joint venture. The Board noted, however, that relating the term &#x2018;investor&#x2019; exclusively to parties with no joint control of the arrangement can be confusing because the parties with joint control of the arrangement are also investors in those arrangements. Accordingly, the Board modified the language in the IFRS to avoid that confusion. However, even though in its redeliberation of ED 9 the Board highlighted that the IFRS establishes recognition and measurement requirements for the parties with joint control of a joint arrangement, the Board decided to address the accounting requirements for parties that participate in, but do not have joint control of, a joint arrangement, to reduce divergence in practice.</p></body></paragraph>
