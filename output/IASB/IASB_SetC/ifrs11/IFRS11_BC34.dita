The Board observed that the term &#x2018;net assets&#x2019; in the definition of joint ventures aimed to portray that the joint venturers have rights to an investment in the arrangement. However, such a definition (ie &#x2018;rights to the net assets of the arrangement&#x2019;) would not prevent a joint venturer from having a net liability position arising from its involvement in the joint venture. This could happen, for example, if the joint venture had incurred losses that had reduced the joint venturer&#x2019;s investment to zero, and as a result of the joint venturer having provided a guarantee to cover any losses that the joint venture might incur, the joint venturer has an obligation for those losses. The Board observed that neither the provision of the guarantee by the joint venturer, nor the liability assumed by the joint venturer as a result of the joint venture incurring losses, determines that the arrangement is a joint operation.</p></body></paragraph>
