This is because these respondents interpreted joint ventures to mean that after parties had identified rights to individual assets or obligations for expenses or financing, joint ventures would be merely any remaining assets and liabilities of the arrangement. As a result of these concerns, the Board clarified that the unit of account of a joint arrangement is the activity that two or more parties have agreed to control jointly, and that a party should assess its rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to that activity. Consequently, the term &#x2018;joint venture&#x2019; refers to a jointly controlled activity in which the parties have an investment. </p></body></paragraph>
