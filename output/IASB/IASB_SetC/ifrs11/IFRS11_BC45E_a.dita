The IASB recognised that the acquisition of an interest in a joint operation does not meet the definition of a business combination in IFRS 3. Nonetheless, the IASB concluded that the most appropriate approach to account for an acquisition of an interest in a joint operation in which the activity of the joint operation constitutes a business, as defined in IFRS 3, is to apply all of the principles on business combinations accounting in IFRS 3 and other IFRSs that do not conflict with the guidance in this IFRS. </p></body></paragraph>
