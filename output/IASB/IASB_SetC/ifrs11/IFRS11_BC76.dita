This is because entities accounting for joint arrangements in accordance with IAS 31 were not required to classify their arrangements on the basis of their rights and obligations arising from the arrangement, but instead on whether the arrangement was structured in an entity. The IFRS will require entities to assess the type of joint arrangement in which they are involved when those arrangements have been structured through a separate vehicle. Even though the classification of the joint arrangements represents an additional assessment that was not required in IAS 31, the application requirements in the IFRS that should assist preparers in the classification of their arrangements are not unduly complex. The Board does not think that the additional assessment that the IFRS will require for the classification of arrangements will result in an undue cost to preparers.</p></body></paragraph>
