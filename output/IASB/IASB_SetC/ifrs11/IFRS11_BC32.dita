However, the Board observed that in some cases the choice of a particular legal form responds to tax, regulatory requirements or other reasons that can alter the intended economic substance initially sought by the parties to the arrangement. In those instances, the parties might use their contractual arrangements to modify the effects that the legal form of the arrangement would otherwise have on their rights and obligations.</p></body></paragraph>
