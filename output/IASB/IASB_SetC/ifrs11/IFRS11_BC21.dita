However, the definition of &#x2018;joint control&#x2019; in the IFRS is different from those in IAS 31 and ED 9. The reason for the change is to align the definition of &#x2018;joint control&#x2019; with the definition of &#x2018;control&#x2019; in IFRS 10. IFRS 11 directs parties to an arrangement to assess first whether all the parties, or a group of the parties, control the arrangement collectively, on the basis of the definition of control and corresponding guidance in IFRS 10.  Once an entity has concluded that the arrangement is collectively controlled by all the parties, or by a group of the parties, joint control exists only when decisions about the activities that significantly affect the returns of the arrangement (ie the relevant activities) require the unanimous consent of those parties. </p></body></paragraph>
