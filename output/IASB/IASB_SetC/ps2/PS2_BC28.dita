The Board concluded that the application of judgement in assessing whether information is material involves both quantitative and qualitative considerations. Respondents to the Practice Statement ED also agreed that, in making materiality judgements, an entity should consider both quantitative and qualitative factors. The Practice Statement includes some examples of materiality factors. However, the Board decided to describe a limited number of factors rather than provide an exhaustive list of considerations to be taken into account.</p></body></paragraph>
