The Board discussed whether this step duplicates the assessment performed in Step 2 and clarified that an entity makes its materiality judgements in Step 2, but then reviews these judgements once a draft of the financial statements is available. In Step 2, an entity based its assessment on the expected financial statements as a whole, while it was still preparing its draft. In Step 4, an entity checks its assessment against the actual draft financial statements&#x2014;this review may lead the entity to revisit the assessment performed in Step 2, provide additional information in the financial statements, remove immaterial information or reorganise existing information.</p></body></paragraph>
