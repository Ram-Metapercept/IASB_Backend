In these circumstances, an entity must comply with the materiality requirements in IFRS Standards, but the Standards do not prohibit the disclosure of additional information required by local laws or regulations, even if that information is not material according to IFRS Standards. A conflict would only occur if local laws or regulations prohibit the inclusion of information that is material for the purpose of IFRS Standards. No respondents to the Practice Statement ED and no participants in the outreach organised by the Board reported such a circumstance.</p></body></paragraph>
