However, the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">IFRS for SMEs</ph></ph> Standard is a separate and stand&#x2011;alone accounting framework based on full IFRS Standards with modifications to reflect cost&#x2011;benefit considerations specific to small and medium sized entities and the need of users of the financial statements of such entities. The <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">IFRS for SMEs</ph></ph> Standard does not refer to the concept of primary users as included in the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (Conceptual Framework)</ph></ph> and does not include recent changes to full IFRS Standards (eg that an entity shall not reduce the understandability of its financial statements by obscuring material information with immaterial information). Therefore, the Board decided that the Practice Statement is not intended for entities applying the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">IFRS for SMEs</ph></ph> Standard. The <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">IFRS for SMEs</ph></ph> Standard permits, but does not require, entities to refer to guidance available in full IFRS Standards. Those entities may therefore refer to the guidance in the Practice Statement in the same way they consider the requirements and guidance in full IFRS Standards dealing with similar and related issues in developing and applying accounting policies when the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">IFRS for SMEs</ph></ph> Standard does not specifically address a transaction, other event or condition.</p></body></paragraph>
