Providing all the information existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors need is not the objective of general purpose financial statements. The Board clarified that an entity is not required to address information needs that respond to unique or individual information requests. An entity should aim to meet primary users&#x2019; common information needs. In developing its guidance, the Board clarified that, to avoid losing information relevant to one category of primary users (among the three identified in the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph>), the common information needs are not limited to the information needs simultaneously shared across all categories of primary users. An entity separately identifies the common information needs for each of the three categories, and meets the total of these needs.</p></body></paragraph>
