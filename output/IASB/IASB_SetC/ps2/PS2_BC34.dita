The Board noted that the assessment of whether an error could reasonably be expected to influence primary users&#x2019; decisions is an integral part of the preparation of the financial statements, and therefore concluded that the Practice Statement should address this topic. The Board noted that the materiality factors an entity would apply to conclude whether an error is material are the same as those described in the materiality process. Consequently, there is no need to provide any specific additional guidance. In the &#x2018;Errors&#x2019; section, the Practice Statement suggests that an entity refer to the considerations described in the materiality process.</p></body></paragraph>
