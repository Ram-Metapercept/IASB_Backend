However, some respondents suggested it would be useful to also describe the practical steps an entity follows when making materiality judgements in the preparation of its financial statements. The Board developed a four&#x2011;step process (materiality process) in consultation with the ASAF, the CMAC and the GPF. The description of the materiality process illustrates the role materiality plays in the preparation of financial statements and clarifies how a materiality judgement is made. The materiality process also identifies the factors an entity should consider when making materiality judgements.</p></body></paragraph>
