Entities applying IFRS Standards are not required to comply with the Practice Statement to state compliance with those Standards. Nevertheless, the Board expects the Practice Statement to help promote a greater understanding of the role of materiality in applying IFRS Standards and of how judgement should be exercised to assess materiality in preparing financial statements. The Board expects that better understanding of the role of materiality will ultimately make financial statements more useful and easier to understand.</p></body></paragraph>
