Respondents to the Practice Statement ED commented that the wording appears inconsistent with <xref id="PS2_X0279" base="F65372933" href="../ias08/IAS08_g41-49.dita#IAS08_g41-49/IAS08_g41-49_TI">paragraph 41 of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 8</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors</ph></ph></xref>. Paragraph 41 of IAS 8 does not characterise such errors as material, however, it requires the correction of all errors made intentionally to achieve a particular presentation of an entity&#x2019;s financial position, financial performance or cash flows. The Board decided to align the wording in the Practice Statement with the wording of paragraph 41 of IAS 8.</p></body></paragraph>
