However, the Board decided that providing guidance on making materiality judgements about prior&#x2011;period information in the Practice Statement would be necessary to promote behavioural change consistently across all parts of the financial statements and to encourage entities to exercise greater judgement when determining what information to include or not to include in financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
