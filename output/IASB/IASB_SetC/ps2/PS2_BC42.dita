The Practice Statement is designed to provide guidance on how to make materiality judgements in the preparation of financial statements. The Practice Statement does not change any requirements in IFRS Standards or introduce any new requirements. With no changes in existing requirements and given that the application of the Practice Statement is not required to state compliance with IFRS Standards, the Board concluded that a separate effects analysis was not necessary.</p></body></paragraph>
