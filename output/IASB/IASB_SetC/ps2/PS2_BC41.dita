The Board concluded that, when preparing an interim financial report, an entity should consider the same materiality factors it considers in preparing its annual financial statements. However, the Board also noted that it would be helpful to explain any additional considerations relevant to making a materiality judgement in the preparation of an interim financial report. In particular, the Board noted that it would be helpful to explain how the different time period and purposes of an interim financial report, compared to the annual financial statements, affect materiality judgements, as well as to address some practical concerns raised by respondents to the Practice Statement ED.</p></body></paragraph>
