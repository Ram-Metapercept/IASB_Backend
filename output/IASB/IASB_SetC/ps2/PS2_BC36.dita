The Board discussed whether to provide further guidance on how to correct such an error, but concluded that the Practice Statement should focus on how to make materiality judgements, instead of dealing with the consequences of these judgements. <xref base="F65372931" href="../ias08/IAS08_TOC.dita#IAS08_TOC0001" id="PS2_X0277">IASÂ 8</xref> contains the requirements on the correction of errors.</p></body></paragraph>
