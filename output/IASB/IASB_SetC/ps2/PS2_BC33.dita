Some stakeholders asked whether providing prior&#x2011;period information at the same level of detail as current&#x2011;period information could be seen as obscuring material information in the current&#x2011;period financial statements. The Board does not expect that such prior&#x2011;period information would obscure current&#x2011;period material information.</p></body></paragraph>
