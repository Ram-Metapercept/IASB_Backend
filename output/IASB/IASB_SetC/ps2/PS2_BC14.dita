In September 2017, on the basis of those discussions, the Board published the Exposure Draft <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Definition of Material (Proposed amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8)</ph></ph> (Definition of Material ED). The Definition of Material ED proposes refining the definition of material by incorporating the existing description of material information in <xref id="PS2_X0254" base="F65372828" href="../ias01/IAS01_g7-8A.dita#IAS01_g7-8A/IAS01_g7-8A_TI">paragraph 7 of IAS 1</xref><xref keyref="footnotes/PS2_FN0063" type="fn"/> and emphasising the need to ensure material information is not obscured, as described in <xref id="PS2_X0255" base="F65372829" href="../ias01/IAS01_30A.dita#IAS01_30A/IAS01_30A_V2">paragraph 30A of IAS 1</xref>. IFRS Standards already include both concepts; consequently, the Practice Statement includes these notions. The Board considered whether to postpone issuing this Practice Statement until the completion of the Definition of Material project. However, the Board concluded that providing guidance on making materiality judgements as quickly as possible would be useful and responded to requests for guidance.</p></body></paragraph>
