In other words, an entity is not required to reperform its materiality assessments the closer it gets to breaching a covenant. However, some stakeholders observed that such guidance would conflict with existing guidance developed by other parties on the assessment of the materiality of errors. To avoid creating any confusion among preparers and others involved in financial reporting, the Board decided not to include in the Practice Statement guidance on the impact of covenants on materiality assessments.</p></body></paragraph>
