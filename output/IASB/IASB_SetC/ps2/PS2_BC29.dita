Step 3 (organise) deals with the output of an entity&#x2019;s materiality judgements and provides guidance the entity might want to consider to make its financial statements easier to understand. The Board recommends that an entity considers the different roles of the primary financial statements and the notes in deciding whether to present an item of information separately in the primary financial statements, to aggregate it with other information and/or to disclose the information in the notes. However, the Board decided not to provide further guidance on those topics in the Practice Statement. A discussion of the roles of the different components of the financial statements, as well as of the implications of those roles, has been included in the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Principles of Disclosure</ph></ph> Discussion Paper, which the Board published in March 2017.</p></body></paragraph>
