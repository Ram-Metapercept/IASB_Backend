However, the Board acknowledged that an entity needs to consider any legal or regulatory requirements when making materiality judgements about prior&#x2011;period information. Consequently, the Board decided to explain that, in its current&#x2011;period financial statements, an entity may summarise prior&#x2011;period information, compared to the way it was included in prior&#x2011;period financial statements, except when local laws or regulations demand otherwise. The Board also clarified that an entity that wishes to state compliance with IFRS Standards cannot provide less information than the information required by the Standards, even if local laws and regulations permit otherwise.</p></body></paragraph>
