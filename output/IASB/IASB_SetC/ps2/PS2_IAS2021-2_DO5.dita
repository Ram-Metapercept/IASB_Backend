In her view, investors are             responsible for ensuring that their economic decisions are derived from a proper and             knowledgeable understanding of an entity&#x2019;s financial statements, which includes             understanding the requirements of IFRS Standards. IFRS Standards should be regarded as             public knowledge in a financial reporting environment. No mere recitation of the words             from the IFRS Standards can meet the definition of material without stretching that             definition endlessly. In Ms Flores&#x2019; view, improving users&#x2019; understanding of the             requirements in IFRS Standards should be achieved through education by the IFRS             Foundation. Such an objective should not be achieved by amending the requirements of             IFRS Standards.</p></body></paragraph>
