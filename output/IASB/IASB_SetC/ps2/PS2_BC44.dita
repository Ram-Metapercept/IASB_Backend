However, some implementation costs might be faced by an entity that has previously relied on a checklist approach when preparing its financial statements. The Board expects such an entity would apply more judgement when deciding what information to include in the financial statements, if it follows the guidance in the Practice Statement. The Board concluded that the benefits of higher-quality disclosures and easier access to information for primary users of financial statements exceed the implementation costs required when entities apply judgement in preparing financial statements, rather than following a checklist. Conversely, an entity already applying appropriate judgement in the preparation of its financial statements would incur no additional implementation costs and could benefit from the issue of the Practice Statement in its interaction with auditors and other stakeholders.</p></body></paragraph>
