The Board&#x2019;s deliberations on the form of the impairment test, including the frequency of impairment testing, are included in the Basis for Conclusions on <xref id="IAS38_X0607" base="F16146929" href="../ias36/IAS36_TOC0001.dita#IAS36_TOC0001">IAS 36</xref>.  The Board further decided that regular re&#x2011;examinations should be required of the useful life of an intangible asset that is not being amortised to determine whether circumstances continue to support the assessment that the useful life is indefinite.</p></body></paragraph>
