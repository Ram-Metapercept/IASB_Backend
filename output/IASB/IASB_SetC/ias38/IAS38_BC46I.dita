It requires costs associated with developing the functionality and infrastructure that make a web site operate to be capitalised. In the Board&#x2019;s view, the electronic infrastructure capitalised in accordance with SIC&#x2011;32 is analogous to the property, plant and equipment infrastructure&#x2014;for example, a sign&#x2014;that permits advertising to be displayed to the public not the content that is displayed on that sign.</p></body></paragraph>
