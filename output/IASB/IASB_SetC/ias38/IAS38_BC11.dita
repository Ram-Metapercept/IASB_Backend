The documents then expanded on this by stating that &#x2018;in the absence of legal rights to protect, or other ways to control, the relationships with customers or the loyalty of the customers to the entity, the entity usually has insufficient control over the economic benefits from customer relationships and loyalty to consider that such items meet the definition of intangible assets&#x2019;.</p></body></paragraph>
