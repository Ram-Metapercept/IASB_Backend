Therefore, if the useful life of an intangible asset was shorter than its economic life because the entity expected to sell the asset before the end of that economic life, the asset&#x2019;s residual value would not be zero, irrespective of whether the conditions in <xref base="F16146890" href="IAS38_BC57.dita#IAS38_BC57" id="IAS38_X0588">paragraph BC57(a) or (b)</xref> are met.</p></body></paragraph>
