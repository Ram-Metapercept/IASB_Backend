It was not the Board&#x2019;s intention to reconsider as part of that project all of the requirements in IAS 38.</p> <p id="IAS38_P0419" base="SL72313">The previous version of IAS 38 was accompanied by a Basis for Conclusions summarising the former International Accounting Standards Committee&#x2019;s considerations in reaching some of its conclusions in that Standard. For convenience the Board has incorporated into its own Basis for Conclusions material from the previous Basis for Conclusions that discusses (a) matters the Board did not reconsider and (b) the history of the development of a standard on intangible assets. That material is contained in paragraphs denoted by numbers with the prefix BCZ. Paragraphs describing the Board&#x2019;s considerations in reaching its own conclusions are numbered with the prefix BC.</p></note></body></topic>
