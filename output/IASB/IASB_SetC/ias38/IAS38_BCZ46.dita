Whilst some view these requirements and guidance as being too restrictive and arbitrary, they are based on IASC&#x2019;s interpretation of the application of the recognition criteria in IAS 38. They also reflect the fact that it is sometimes difficult to determine whether there is an internally generated intangible asset distinguishable from internally generated goodwill.</p></body></paragraph>
