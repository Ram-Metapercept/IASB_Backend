A minority of commentators on E60 supported maintaining two separate Standards. This minority supported the view that internally generated intangible assets should be dealt with on a case&#x2011;by&#x2011;case basis with separate requirements for different types of internally generated intangible assets. These commentators argued that E60&#x2019;s proposed recognition criteria were too general to be effective in practice for all internally generated intangible assets.</p></body></paragraph>
