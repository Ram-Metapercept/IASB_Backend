In other words, the useful life of a tangible asset could never extend beyond the asset&#x2019;s expected physical utility to the entity.</p></li></ol><p id="IAS38_P0577" base="SL142333">The Board concluded that tangible assets (other than land) could not be regarded as having indefinite useful lives because there is always a foreseeable limit to the expected physical utility of the asset to the entity.</p></body></paragraph>
