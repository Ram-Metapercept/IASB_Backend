<paragraph id="IAS38_BC59" base="SL32562"><paranum>BC59</paranum><prolog><data name="standard_number" value="IAS 38"/><data name="paranum" value="BC59"/></prolog><body><p id="IAS38_P0568">Nevertheless, the Board observed that the requirement for the residual value of an intangible asset to be assumed to be zero unless the specified criteria are met was included in the previous version of IAS 38 as a means of preventing entities from circumventing the requirement in that Standard to amortise all intangible assets. Excluding this requirement from the revised Standard for finite&#x2011;lived intangible assets would similarly provide a means of circumventing the requirement to amortise such intangible assets&#x2014;by claiming that the residual value of such an asset was equal to or greater than its carrying amount, an entity could avoid amortising the asset, even though its useful life is finite. The Board concluded that it should not, as part of the Business Combinations project, modify the criteria for permitting a finite&#x2011;lived intangible asset&#x2019;s residual value to be other than zero. However, the Board decided that this issue should be addressed as part of a forthcoming project on intangible assets.</p></body></paragraph>
