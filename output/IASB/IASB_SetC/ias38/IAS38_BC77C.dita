Differences in the revaluation models for items of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets do not result in different models for restating accumulated depreciation/amortisation. For example, IAS 38 requires that the fair value of an intangible asset is measured by reference to an active market. Otherwise, the revaluation model cannot be applied. However, IAS 38 requires fair value measurement by reference to an active market only for the carrying amount of an intangible asset in contrast to its gross carrying amount.</p></body></paragraph>
