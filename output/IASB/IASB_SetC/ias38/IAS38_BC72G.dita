One of those circumstances is when it can be demonstrated that revenue is highly correlated with the consumption of the economic benefits embodied in an intangible asset. The IASB also noted that another circumstance in which revenue could be used is when the right embodied by an intangible asset is expressed as a total amount of revenue to be generated (rather than time, for example), in such a way that the generation of revenue is the measurement used to determine when the right expires. The IASB noted that, in this case, the pattern of consumption of future economic benefits that is embodied in the intangible asset is defined by reference to the total revenue earned as a proportion of the contractual maximum and, consequently, the amount of revenue generated contractually reflects the consumption of the benefits that are embodied in the asset.</p></body></paragraph>
