The effects of uncertainty because of a range of possible outcomes with different probabilities are reflected in measuring the asset&#x2019;s fair value;<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS38_FN0011" type="fn"/> the existence of such a range does not demonstrate an inability to measure fair value reliably. IAS 38 (as revised in 2004) included a rebuttable presumption that the fair value of an intangible asset with a finite useful life acquired in a business combination can be measured reliably. The Board had concluded that it might not always be possible to measure reliably the fair value of an asset that has an underlying contractual or legal basis. However, IAS 38 (revised 2004) provided that the only circumstances in which it might not be possible to measure reliably the fair value of an intangible asset acquired in a business combination that arises from legal or other contractual rights were if it either:</p><ol id="IAS38_L0050" base="F4987846" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IAS38_P0452" base="F4987850">is not separable; or</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IAS38_P0453" base="F4987852">is separable, but there is no history or evidence of exchange transactions for the same or similar assets, and otherwise estimating fair value would depend on immeasurable variables.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
