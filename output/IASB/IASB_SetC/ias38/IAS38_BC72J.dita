During its deliberations the IASB determined that, when choosing an amortisation method, an entity could determine the predominant limiting factor for the use of the intangible asset. For example, a contract could be limited by a number of years (ie time), a number of units produced or an amount of revenue to be generated. The IASB clarified that identifying such a predominant limiting factor is only a starting point for the identification of the amortisation method and an entity may apply another basis if the entity determines that it more closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of economic benefits.</p></body></paragraph>
