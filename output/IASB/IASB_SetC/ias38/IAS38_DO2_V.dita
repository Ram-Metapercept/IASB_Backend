Professor Whittington does not believe that the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph><xref keyref="footnotes/IAS38_FN0025" type="fn"/> precludes having a prior recognition test based on probability, even when subsequent recognition is at fair value. Moreover, the application of probability may be different for recognition purposes: for example, it may be the &#x2018;more likely than not&#x2019; criterion used in IAS 37 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets</ph></ph>, rather than the &#x2018;expected value&#x2019; approach used in the measurement of fair value.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
