Comment letters on E50 showed that the proposal for the amortisation period for intangible assets&#x2014;a 20&#x2011;year ceiling for almost all intangible assets, as required for goodwill in IAS 22 (revised 1993)&#x2014;raised significant controversy and created serious concerns about the overall acceptability of the proposed standard on intangible assets. IASC considered alternative solutions and concluded in March 1996 that, if an impairment test that is sufficiently robust and reliable could be developed, IASC would propose deleting the 20&#x2011;year ceiling on the amortisation period for both intangible assets and goodwill.</p></body></paragraph>
