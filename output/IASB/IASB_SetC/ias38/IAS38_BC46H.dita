The Board agreed and concluded that its proposed amendments would result in accounting that is almost identical to that resulting from the application of SIC&#x2011;32. In particular, SIC&#x2011;32 requires the cost of content (to the extent that it is developed to advertise and promote products and services) to be recognised as an expense as it is incurred. The Board concluded that in the case of a mail order catalogue, the majority of the content is intended to advertise and promote products and services. Therefore, permitting the cost of catalogues to be capitalised while at the same time requiring the cost of developing and uploading web site content used to advertise and promote an entity&#x2019;s products to be recognised as an expense would base the accounting on the nature of the media (paper or electronic) used to deliver the content rather than the nature of the expenditure.</p></body></paragraph>
