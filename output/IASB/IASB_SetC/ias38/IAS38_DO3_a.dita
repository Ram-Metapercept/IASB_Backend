Are signs constructed by a restaurant chain at their location an advertising expense in the period of construction? Would the costs of putting an entity&#x2019;s name on trucks, airplanes and buildings be an advertising expense in the year incurred? The logic of this amendment would suggest an affirmative answer to these questions even though the result of the expenditure benefits several periods.</p></body></paragraph>
