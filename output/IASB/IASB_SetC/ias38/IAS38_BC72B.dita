The IASB&#x2019;s decision was in response to a request to clarify the meaning of the term &#x2018;consumption of the expected future economic benefits embodied in the asset&#x2019; when determining the appropriate amortisation method for intangible assets of service concession arrangements (SCA) that are within the scope of IFRIC 12 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Service Concession Arrangements</ph></ph>. The issue raised is related to the application of <xref id="IAS38_X0597" base="F34942889" href="IAS38_97.dita#IAS38_97">paragraphs 97&#x2013;98 of IAS 38</xref>, although the IASB decided to address the issue broadly, rather than limit it only to intangible assets arising in an SCA.</p></body></paragraph>
