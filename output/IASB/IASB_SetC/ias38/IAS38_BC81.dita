The Board concluded that adopting different criteria would impair the usefulness of the information provided to users about the assets acquired in a combination because both comparability and reliability would be diminished. Therefore, IAS 38 and <xref base="F16146932" href="../ifrs03/IFRS03_TOC.dita#IFRS03_TOC0001" id="IAS38_X0615">IFRS 3</xref> require an acquirer to recognise as an asset separately from goodwill any of the acquiree&#x2019;s IPR&amp;D projects that meet the definition of an intangible asset. This will be the case when the IPR&amp;D project meets the definition of an asset and is identifiable, ie is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights.</p></body></paragraph>
