The Board made related amendments to IAS 38 to reflect that decision. However, the Board identified additional amendments that were needed to reflect clearly its decisions on the accounting for intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Consequently, in <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Improvements to IFRSs</ph></ph> issued in April 2009, the Board amended paragraphs 36 and 37 of IAS 38 to clarify the Board&#x2019;s intentions.</p></body></paragraph>
