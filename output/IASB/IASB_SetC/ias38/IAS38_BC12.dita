Exchange transactions for the same asset or a similar asset provide evidence of separability of a non&#x2011;contractual customer relationship and might also provide information about exchange prices that should be considered when estimating fair value.&#x2019; Whilst respondents to the Exposure Draft generally agreed with the Board&#x2019;s conclusions on the definition of identifiability, some were uncertain about the relationship between the separability criterion for establishing whether a non&#x2011;contractual customer relationship is identifiable, and the control concept for establishing whether the relationship meets the definition of an asset. Additionally, some respondents suggested that non&#x2011;contractual customer relationships would, under the proposal in the Exposure Draft, be separately recognised if acquired in a business combination, but not if acquired in a separate transaction.</p></body></paragraph>
