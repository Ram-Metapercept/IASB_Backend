The Board acknowledged this point, but concluded that this does not provide a basis for subsuming those acquired intangible assets within goodwill. Rather, it highlights a need to reconsider the conclusion in the Standard that an intangible asset can never exist in respect of an in&#x2011;process research project and can exist in respect of an in&#x2011;process development project only once all of the Standard&#x2019;s criteria for deferral have been satisfied. The Board decided that such a reconsideration is outside the scope of its Business Combinations project.</p></body></paragraph>
