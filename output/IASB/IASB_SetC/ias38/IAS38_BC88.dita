However, applying the subsequent expenditure requirements in the previous version of IAS 38 to subsequent expenditure on IPR&amp;D projects acquired in a business combination and recognised as assets separately from goodwill would result in research and development expenditure being accounted for differently depending on whether a project is acquired or started internally.</p></body></paragraph>
