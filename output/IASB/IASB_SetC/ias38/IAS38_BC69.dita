Therefore, useful life should reflect renewal only when renewal is not subject to third&#x2011;party approval.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IAS38_P0584" base="SL142339">such a requirement would be inconsistent with the basis used to measure intangible assets at the date of a business combination, particularly contractual customer relationships. For example, it is not clear whether the fair value of a contractual customer relationship includes an amount that reflects the probability that the contract will be renewed. The possibility of renewal would have a fair value regardless of the costs required to renew. This means the useful life of a contractual customer relationship could be inconsistent with the basis used to determine the fair value of the relationship.<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS38_FN0020" type="fn"/></p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
