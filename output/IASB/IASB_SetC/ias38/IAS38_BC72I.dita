The IASB considered suggestions that an intangible asset should be componentised for amortisation purposes in circumstances in which the asset is used to generate multiple cash flow streams. It observed that separating an asset into different components is not a new practice in business or in IFRS&#x2014;it is routinely done for property, plant and equipment and IAS 16 provides guidance in this respect&#x2014;but refrained from developing guidance in this respect for intangible assets.</p></body></paragraph>
