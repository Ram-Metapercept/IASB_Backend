That asset is the right to receive those goods and services. Therefore, the Board decided to retain <xref id="IAS38_X0574" base="F16146846" href="IAS38_70.dita#IAS38_70">paragraph 70</xref>, which allows an entity to recognise as an asset the right to receive those goods or services. However, the Board did not believe that this paragraph should be used as a justification for recognising an asset beyond the point at which the entity gained a right to access the related goods or received the related services. Therefore, the Board decided to amend the paragraph to make clear that a prepayment may be recognised by an entity only until that entity has gained a right to access to the related goods or has received the related services.</p></body></paragraph>
