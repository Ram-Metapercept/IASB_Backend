Thus, no matter how the liability is measured, the Board concluded that it should be accrued over the vesting period, to the extent that the employees have performed their side of the arrangement. For example, if the terms of the arrangement require the employees to perform services over a three&#x2011;year period, the liability would be accrued over that three&#x2011;year period, consistently with the treatment of other cash&#x2011;settled employee benefits.</p></body></paragraph>
