In this revision, the Board decided to ease the restriction on when the period for a performance target could start. It therefore decided to clarify that the start of the period of achieving the performance target could be before the service period, provided that the commencement date of the performance target is not substantially before the commencement of the service period. </p></body></paragraph>
