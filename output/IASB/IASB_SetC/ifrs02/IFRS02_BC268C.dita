The Board considered whether a different conclusion should be reached for such arrangements merely because they are cash&#x2011;settled rather than equity&#x2011;settled. <xref id="IFRS02_X0984" base="F15998832" href="IFRS02_BC22A.dita#IFRS02_BC22A">Paragraphs BC22A&#x2013;BC22F</xref> explain the Board&#x2019;s considerations in finalising the amendments to clarify the scope of IFRS 2. The section below summarises the Board&#x2019;s considerations in finalising the amendments relating to the measurement of such transactions.</p></body></paragraph>
