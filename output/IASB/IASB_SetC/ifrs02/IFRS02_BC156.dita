In other words, from the entity&#x2019;s perspective, its commitments under the contract are unaffected by whether the shares are issued to the original option holder or to someone else. Therefore, in valuing the entity&#x2019;s side of the contract, from the entity&#x2019;s perspective, non&#x2011;transferability seems irrelevant.</p></body></paragraph>
