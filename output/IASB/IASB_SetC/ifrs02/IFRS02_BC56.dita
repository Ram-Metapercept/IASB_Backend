This is illustrated by the plant and machinery example mentioned in <xref id="IFRS02_X0921" base="F15998551" href="IFRS02_BC42.dita#IFRS02_BC42">paragraphs BC42 and BC43</xref>. Issuing shares affects the number of shares in the EPS calculation, and the consumption (depreciation) of the asset affects earnings.</p></body></paragraph>
