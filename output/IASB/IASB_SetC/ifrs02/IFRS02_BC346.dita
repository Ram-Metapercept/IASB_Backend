This is so that, in order to constitute a performance condition, a performance target needs to be accompanied by a service requirement, which can be implicit or explicit. The Board observed that if the share-based payment arrangement does not contain an explicit requirement to provide services, the arrangement may still contain an implicit service condition. </p></body></paragraph>
