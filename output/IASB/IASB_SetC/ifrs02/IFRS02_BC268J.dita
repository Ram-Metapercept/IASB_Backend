However, the approach adopted in IFRS 2 is different from that in IAS 19 in that the entity receiving goods or services in a share&#x2011;based payment transaction recognises an expense even when it has no obligation to pay cash or other assets. The Board concluded that this approach is consistent with the expense attribution principles underlying IFRS 2.</p></body></paragraph>
