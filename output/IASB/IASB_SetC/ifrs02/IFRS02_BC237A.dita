The Board concluded that in order to be consistent with the grant date measurement method, failure to meet a non&#x2011;vesting condition should have no accounting effect when neither the entity nor the counterparty can choose whether that condition is met. The entity should continue to recognise the expense, based on the grant date fair value, over the vesting period unless the employee fails to meet a vesting condition.</p></body></paragraph>
