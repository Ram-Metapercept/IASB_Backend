For example, suppose that services are received during years 1&#x2013;3 as the consideration for share options that are exercised at the end of year 5. For services received in year 1, subsequent changes in the value of the share option in years 2&#x2013;5 are unrelated to, and have no effect on, the fair value of those services when received.</p></body></paragraph>
