For example, when shares are issued for cash, an entry is required to recognise the cash received. If a non&#x2011;monetary asset, such as plant and machinery, is received for those shares instead of cash, an entry is required to recognise the asset received. If the entity acquires another business or entity by issuing shares in a business combination, the entity recognises the net assets acquired.</p></body></paragraph>
