In the ED the Board proposed to clarify within the definition of service condition that if the employee fails to complete a specified service period, the employee thereby fails to satisfy a service condition, regardless of the reason for that failure. The Board also noted that the accounting consequence is that the compensation expense would be reversed if an employee fails to complete a specified service period.</p></body></paragraph>
