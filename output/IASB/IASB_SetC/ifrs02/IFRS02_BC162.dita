However, the Board concluded that it was not necessary to prohibit the use of the Black&#x2011;Scholes&#x2011;Merton formula, because there might be instances in which the formula produces a sufficiently reliable estimate of the fair value of the share options granted. For example, if the entity has not granted many share options, the effects of applying a more flexible model might not have a material impact on the entity&#x2019;s financial statements. Also, for share options with relatively short contractual lives, or share options that must be exercised within a short period of time after vesting date, the issues discussed in <xref id="IFRS02_X0956" base="F15998712" href="IFRS02_BC160.dita#IFRS02_BC160">paragraph BC160</xref> may not be relevant, and hence the Black&#x2011;Scholes&#x2011;Merton formula may produce a value that is substantially the same as that produced by a more flexible option pricing model. Therefore, rather than prohibit the use of the Black&#x2011;Scholes&#x2011;Merton formula, the Board concluded that the IFRS should include guidance on selecting the most appropriate model to apply. This includes the requirement that the entity should consider factors that knowledgeable, willing market participants would consider in selecting the option pricing model to apply.</p></body></paragraph>
