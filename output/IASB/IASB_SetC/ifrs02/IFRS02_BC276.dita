It requires recognition of share&#x2011;based payment transactions with parties other than employees, based on the fair value of the shares or share options issued or the fair value of the goods or services received, whichever is more reliably measurable. Entities are also encouraged, but not required, to apply the fair value accounting method in SFAS 123 to share&#x2011;based payment transactions with employees. Generally speaking, SFAS 123 draws no distinction between fixed and performance&#x2011;related plans.</p></body></paragraph>
