The entity&#x2019;s own shares are not an asset of the entity.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS02_FN0045" type="fn"/> Rather, the shares are an interest in the entity&#x2019;s assets. Hence, the distribution of cash to buy back shares is a return of capital to shareholders, and should therefore be recognised as a decrease in equity. Similarly, when the shares are subsequently reissued or transferred, the inflow of cash is an increase in shareholders&#x2019; capital, and should therefore be recognised as an increase in equity. It follows that no revenue or expense should be recognised. Just as the issue of shares does not represent revenue to the entity, the repurchase of those shares does not represent an expense.</p></body></paragraph>
