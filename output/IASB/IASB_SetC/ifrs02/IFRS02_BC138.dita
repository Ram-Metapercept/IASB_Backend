The minimum value method is explained earlier, in <xref id="IFRS02_X0955" base="F15998711" href="IFRS02_gBC80-BC83.dita#IFRS02_gBC80-BC83">paragraphs BC80&#x2013;BC83</xref>. Because it excludes the effects of expected volatility, the minimum value method produces a value that is lower, often much lower, than that produced by methods designed to estimate the fair value of an option. Therefore, the Board discussed how an unlisted entity could estimate expected volatility.</p></body></paragraph>
