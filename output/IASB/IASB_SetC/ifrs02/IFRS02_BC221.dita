For example, an employee with vested share options typically must exercise those options within a short period after cessation of employment, otherwise the options are forfeited. If the share options are not in the money, the employee is unlikely to exercise the options and hence they will be forfeited. For the same reasons as are given in <xref id="IFRS02_X0964" base="F15998753" href="IFRS02_BC219.dita#IFRS02_BC219">paragraph BC219</xref>, no adjustment is made to the amounts previously recognised for services received as consideration for the share options. The only accounting entry that might be required is a movement within equity, to reflect that the share options are no longer outstanding.</p></body></paragraph>
