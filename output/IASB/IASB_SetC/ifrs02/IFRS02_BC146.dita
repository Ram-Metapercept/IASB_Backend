For example, a share option might be granted with a ten&#x2011;year life and a vesting period of three years, so the option is not exercisable for the first three years and can then be exercised at any time during the remaining seven years. Employee share options cannot be exercised during the vesting period because the employees must first &#x2018;pay&#x2019; for the options, by providing the necessary services.
