This means that an expense for the consumption of resources is recognised immediately, rather than over a period of time. The Board concluded that the timing of consumption does not change the principle; the financial statements should recognise the receipt and consumption of resources, even when consumption occurs at the same time as, or soon after, receipt. This point is discussed further in <xref id="IFRS02_X0913" base="F15998519" href="IFRS02_BC45.dita#IFRS02_BC45">paragraphs BC45&#x2013;BC53</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
