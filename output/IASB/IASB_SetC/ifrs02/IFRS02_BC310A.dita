An entity might not have accounted for some group share&#x2011;based payment transactions in accordance with IFRS 2 in its separate or individual financial statements. In a few cases, an entity that settles a group share&#x2011;based payment transaction may have to apply hindsight to measure the fair value of awards now required to be accounted for as cash&#x2011;settled. However, the Board noted that such transactions would have been accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 in the group&#x2019;s consolidated financial statements. For these reasons and those outlined in <xref id="IFRS02_X1004" base="F15998947" href="IFRS02_BC268G.dita#IFRS02_BC268G">paragraph BC268G</xref>, if the information necessary for retrospective application is not available, the Board decided to require an entity to use amounts previously recognised in the group&#x2019;s consolidated financial statements when applying the new requirements retrospectively in the entity&#x2019;s separate or individual financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
