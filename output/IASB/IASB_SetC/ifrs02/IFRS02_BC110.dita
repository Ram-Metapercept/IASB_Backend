The Board recognises that this creates a difference between IFRS 2 and <xref base="F15998637" href="../ias32/IAS32_TOC.dita#IAS32_TOC0001" id="IFRS02_X0944">IAS 32</xref>. Before deciding whether and how that difference should be eliminated, the Board concluded that it is necessary to address this issue in a broader context, as part of a fundamental review of the definitions of liabilities and equity in the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph>, particularly because this is not the only debt/equity classification issue that has arisen in the share&#x2011;based payment project, as explained below.</p></body></paragraph>
