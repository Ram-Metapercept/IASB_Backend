So the question is, which accounting method is more likely to produce the smallest amount of error and the most relevant, comparable information&#x2014;a fair value estimate, which might result in some understatement or overstatement of the associated expense, or another measurement basis, such as intrinsic value (especially if measured at grant date), that will definitely result in substantial understatement of the associated expense?</p></body></paragraph>
