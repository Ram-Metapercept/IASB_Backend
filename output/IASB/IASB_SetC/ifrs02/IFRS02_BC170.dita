The most common condition is that the employee must remain in the entity&#x2019;s employ for a specified period, say three years. If the employee leaves during that period, the options are forfeited. There might also be other performance conditions, eg that the entity achieves a specified growth in share price or earnings.</p></body></paragraph>
