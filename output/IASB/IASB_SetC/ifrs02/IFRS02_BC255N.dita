The Board observed that the classification exception (in paragraph 33F) for the classification of a share-based payment award with a net settlement feature would not apply to any equity instruments withheld in excess of the number required to equal the monetary value of the employee&#x2019;s tax obligation. Consequently, when that excess amount is paid to the employee in cash (or other assets), and consistent with existing requirements, the excess number of equity instruments withheld should be separated and accounted for as a cash-settled share-based payment.</p></body></paragraph>
