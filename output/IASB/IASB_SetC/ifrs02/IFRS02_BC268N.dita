<paragraph id="IFRS02_BC268N" base="F9045073"><paranum>BC268N</paranum><prolog><data name="standard_number" value="IFRS 2"/><data name="paranum" value="BC268N"/></prolog><body><p id="IFRS02_P2387">The Board noted that, on its own, either of the two criteria described above would not consistently reflect the entity&#x2019;s perspective when assessing the appropriate classification for transactions described in <xref id="IFRS02_X0990" base="F15998868" href="IFRS02_BC268B.dita#IFRS02_BC268B">paragraph BC268B</xref>. The Board concluded that the entity should consider both criteria in IFRIC 11, ie <i>equity&#x2011;settled</i> when suppliers are given the entity&#x2019;s own equity instruments or when the entity receiving the goods or services has no obligation to settle and <i>cash&#x2011;settled</i> in all other circumstances. The Board also noted that when the entity receiving goods or services has no obligation to deliver cash or other assets to its suppliers, accounting for the transaction as cash&#x2011;settled in its separate or individual financial statements is not appropriate. The equity&#x2011;settled basis is more consistent with the principles and rationales in both IFRS 2 and IFRIC 11. Therefore, the Board decided that the entity receiving the goods or services should classify both of the group cash&#x2011;settled share&#x2011;based payment transactions described in <xref id="IFRS02_X0991" base="F15998869" href="IFRS02_BC268B.dita#IFRS02_BC268B">paragraph BC268B</xref> as <i>equity&#x2011;settled</i> in its separate or individual financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
