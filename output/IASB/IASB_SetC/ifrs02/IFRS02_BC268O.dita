The Board concluded that the broader principles it developed during its redeliberations addressed the three main concerns expressed by respondents described in <xref id="IFRS02_X0993" base="F15998871" href="IFRS02_BC268F.dita#IFRS02_BC268F">paragraph BC268F</xref>. Those principles apply to all group share&#x2011;based payment transactions, whether they are cash&#x2011;settled or equity&#x2011;settled. The Board&#x2019;s conclusions do not result in any changes to the guidance in IFRIC 11 that addressed similar group equity&#x2011;settled share&#x2011;based payment transactions. Other than the change described above, the Board reaffirmed the proposals in the exposure draft. Therefore, the Board concluded that it was not necessary to re&#x2011;expose the amendments before finalising them.</p></body></paragraph>
