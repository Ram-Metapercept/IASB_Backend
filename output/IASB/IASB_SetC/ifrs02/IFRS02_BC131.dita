There is no particular option pricing model that is regarded as theoretically superior to the others, and there is the risk that any model specified might be superseded by improved methodologies in the future. Entities should select whichever model is most appropriate in the circumstances. For example, many employee share options have long lives, are usually exercisable during the period between vesting date and the end of the option&#x2019;s life, and are often exercised early. These factors should be considered when estimating the grant date fair value of share options. For many entities, this might preclude the use of the Black&#x2011;Scholes&#x2011;Merton formula, which does not take into account the possibility of exercise before the end of the share option&#x2019;s life and may not adequately reflect the effects of expected early exercise. This is discussed further below (<xref id="IFRS02_X0954" base="F15998710" href="IFRS02_BC160.dita#IFRS02_BC160">paragraphs BC160&#x2013;BC162</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
