This is because the requirement in paragraph 27 of IFRS 2 to recognise a minimum amount for the equity-settled share-based payment following a modification is inconsistent with the requirement in paragraph 30 of IFRS 2 to remeasure the liability for a cash-settled share-based payment at fair value at the end of each reporting date until the liability is settled.</p></body></paragraph>
