The fair value of any item depends on the expected amounts, timing, and uncertainty of the future cash flows relating to the item. The share option grant gives the employee the right to subscribe to the entity&#x2019;s shares at the exercise price, provided that the vesting conditions are satisfied and the exercise price is paid during the specified period. The effect of the vesting conditions is considered below. The effect of the share option being non&#x2011;exercisable during the vesting period has already been considered above, as has the effect of non&#x2011;transferability. There does not seem to be any additional effect on the expected amounts, timing or uncertainty of the future cash flows arising from the combination of non&#x2011;exercisability and non&#x2011;transferability during the vesting period.</p></body></paragraph>
