It thought that this decision was consistent with the definition of a performance condition, which was previously included within the definition of a vesting condition. The definition of a performance condition requires the counterparty to complete a specified period of service and to meet the performance target(s) while the counterparty is rendering the service required. The definition of performance condition reflects the principle in paragraph 7 of IFRS 2, which states that &#x201C;An entity shall recognise the goods or services received or acquired in a share-based payment transaction when it obtains the goods or as the services are received&#x201D;. </p></body></paragraph>
