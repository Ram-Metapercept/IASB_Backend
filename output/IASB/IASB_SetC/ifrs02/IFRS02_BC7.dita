However, the scope of IFRS 2 is broader than that. It applies to transactions in which shares or other equity instruments are granted to employees. It also applies to transactions with parties other than employees, in which goods or services are received as consideration for the issue of shares, share options or other equity instruments. The term &#x2018;goods&#x2019; includes inventories, consumables, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and other non&#x2011;financial assets. Lastly, the IFRS applies to payments in cash (or other assets) that are &#x2018;share&#x2011;based&#x2019; because the amount of the payment is based on the price of the entity&#x2019;s shares or other equity instruments, eg cash share appreciation rights.</p></body></paragraph>
