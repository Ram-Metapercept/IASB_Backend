For example, the terms &#x2018;shareholder&#x2019; and &#x2018;parent&#x2019; have different meanings: a shareholder is not necessarily a parent, and a parent does not have to be a shareholder. The Board noted that share&#x2011;based payment transactions among group entities are often directed by the parent, indicating a level of control. Therefore, the Board clarified the boundaries of a &#x2018;group&#x2019; by adopting the same definition as in <xref id="IFRS02_X0891" base="F78010887" href="../ias27/IAS27_4.dita#IAS27_4">paragraph 4 of IAS 27 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements</ph></ph></xref>, which includes only a parent and its subsidiaries.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS02_FN0034" type="fn"/></p></body></paragraph>
