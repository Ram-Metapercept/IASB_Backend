The Board did not think this was necessary because of the existing examples in the implementation guidance that illustrate the effects of market and non-market vesting conditions and of non-vesting conditions on equity-settled awards. These examples also serve to illustrate the effects of such conditions on cash-settled awards because the amendments require consistent treatment for both types of awards.</p></body></paragraph>
