The Board therefore concluded that the IFRS should require an entity to presume that the fair value of the goods or services received can be measured reliably.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS02_FN0049" type="fn"/> However, in rare cases in which the presumption is rebutted, it is necessary to measure the transaction at the fair value of the equity instruments granted.</p></body></paragraph>
