Hence, for the debt component, the entity should recognise the services received, and a liability to pay for those services, as the employees render services, in the same manner as other cash&#x2011;settled share&#x2011;based payment transactions (eg SARs). For the equity component (if any), the entity should recognise the services received, and an increase in equity, as the employees render services, in the same way as other equity&#x2011;settled share&#x2011;based payment transactions.</p></body></paragraph>
