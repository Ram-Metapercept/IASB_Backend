For example, the employee might be able, in effect, to sell an employee share option by entering into an arrangement with an investment bank whereby the employee sells a similar call option to the bank, ie an option with the same exercise price and term. A zero&#x2011;cost collar is one means of obtaining protection from changes in the value of an employee share option, by selling a call option and buying a put option.</p></body></paragraph>
