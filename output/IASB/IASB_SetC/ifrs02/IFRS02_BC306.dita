For example, for share options granted to employees, factors that affect the value of the option from the individual employee&#x2019;s perspective only are not relevant to estimating the price that would be set by a knowledgeable, willing market participant. Many respondents&#x2019; comments about measurement reliability, and the differences between employee share options and traded options, often focused on the value of the option from the employee&#x2019;s perspective. Therefore, the Board concluded that the IFRS should emphasise that the objective is to estimate the fair value of the share option, not an employee&#x2011;specific value.</p></body></paragraph>
