Suppose that the entity estimates the possibility of forfeiture because of failure of the employees to complete the required three&#x2011;year period of service is 20 per cent (based on a weighted average probability), and hence it estimates the fair value of the options granted at CU600,000 (CU750,000 × 80%). The entity expects to receive 1,350 units of service over the three&#x2011;year vesting period.</p></body></paragraph>
