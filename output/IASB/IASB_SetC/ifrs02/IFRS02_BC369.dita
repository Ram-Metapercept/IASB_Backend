The Board observed that in circumstances in which the equity instruments either partly or fully vest on cessation of employment, <xref id="IFRS02_X1048" base="F35621210" href="IFRS02_g23-23.dita#IFRS02_g23-23/IFRS02_g23-23_TI">paragraph 23 of IFRS 2</xref> states that &#x201C;the entity shall make no subsequent adjustment to total equity after vesting date&#x201D;. The Board also noted that, in accordance with <xref id="IFRS02_X1049" base="F35271081" href="IFRS02_28.dita#IFRS02_28">paragraph 28</xref>, &#x201C;if a grant of equity instruments is cancelled or settled during the vesting period (other than a grant cancelled by forfeiture when the vesting conditions are not satisfied) the entity shall account for the cancellation or settlement as an acceleration of vesting, and shall therefore recognise immediately the amount that otherwise would have been recognised for services received over the remainder of the vesting period&#x201D;. Noting the guidance already provided in IFRS 2, the Board concluded that further guidance was not necessary.</p></body></paragraph>
