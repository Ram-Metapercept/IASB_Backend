Those tax withholding obligations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. To fulfill this obligation, many plans include a net settlement feature that permits or requires the entity to deduct from the total number of equity instruments that it otherwise would deliver to the employee, the number of equity instruments needed to equal the monetary value of the tax obligation that the employee incurs as a result of the share-based payment transaction. The entity transfers the amount withheld to the tax authority in cash or other assets.</p></body></paragraph>
