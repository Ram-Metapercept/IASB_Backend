However, consistently with its conclusions on the other differences between IFRS 2 and <xref base="F15998828" href="../ias32/IAS32_TOC.dita#IAS32_TOC0001" id="IFRS02_X0980">IAS 32</xref> (see <xref base="F15998829" href="IFRS02_BC106.dita#IFRS02_BC106" id="IFRS02_X0981">paragraphs BC106&#x2013;BC110</xref>), the Board decided to retain this difference, pending the outcome of its longer&#x2011;term Concepts project, which includes reviewing the definitions of liabilities and equity.</p></body></paragraph>
