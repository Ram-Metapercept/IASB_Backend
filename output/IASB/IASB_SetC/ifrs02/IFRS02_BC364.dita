This is because the Board observed that the concept of a non-vesting condition can be inferred from <xref id="IFRS02_X1046" base="F35621209" href="IFRS02_gBC170-BC184.dita#IFRS02_gBC170-BC184/IFRS02_gBC170-BC184_TI">paragraphs BC170&#x2013;BC184 of IFRS 2</xref>, which clarify the definition of vesting conditions. In accordance with this guidance it can be inferred that a non-vesting condition is any condition that does not determine whether the entity receives the services that entitle the counterparty to receive cash, other assets or equity instruments of the entity under a share-based payment arrangement. In other words, a non-vesting condition is any condition that is not a vesting condition. On the basis of its analysis the Board decided to not add a definition of non-vesting condition.</p></body></paragraph>
