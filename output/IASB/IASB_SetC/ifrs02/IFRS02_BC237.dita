Therefore, the Board concluded that, for arrangements that are classified as equity&#x2011;settled arrangements (at least initially), the entity must recognise the grant date fair value of the equity instruments over the vesting period, unless the employee fails to vest in those equity instruments under the terms of the original vesting conditions.</p></body></paragraph>
