The Board confirmed that it was not its intention to do so. It observed that the link between the employee&#x2019;s service/performance against a given performance target is management&#x2019;s responsibility. It noted that each employee has, in varying degrees, an influence over an entity&#x2019;s (or group&#x2019;s) overall performance, that is, over an entity&#x2019;s (or group&#x2019;s) own operations (or activities) or the price (or value) of its equity instruments. Consequently, the Board decided to omit the requirement that the target &#x201C;needs to be within the influence of the employee&#x201D; to avoid further confusion.</p></body></paragraph>
