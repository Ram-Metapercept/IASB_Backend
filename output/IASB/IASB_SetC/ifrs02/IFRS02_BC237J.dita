The Board observed that if an entity does not identify a grant of equity instruments as a replacement, the entity would have to reverse the expense recognised for the cash-settled share-based payment and recognise an expense for the new equity-settled share-based payment. The Board noted that this accounting treatment is different from the accounting for modifications of equity-settled awards when the entity does not identify new equity instruments granted as replacement equity instruments for the cancelled equity instrument (as set out in paragraph 28(c) of IFRS 2). In that case, the entity does not reverse the expense recognised for the cancelled original equity-settled award and recognises an expense for the new grant of equity instruments.</p></body></paragraph>
