Under this view, it is as if the entity settles the share-based payment transaction in its entirety by issuing equity instruments to the employee. As a separate (yet simultaneous) transaction, the entity repurchases a portion of those equity instruments from the employee. The entity then remits the cash value of the repurchased equity instruments to the tax authority on behalf of the employee to settle the employee&#x2019;s tax obligation in relation to the share-based payment.</p></body></paragraph>
