For example, the requirements of APB 25 typically result in the recognition of an expense for performance&#x2011;related share options but usually no expense is recognised for fixed share options. This result is anomalous because fixed share options are usually more valuable at grant date than performance&#x2011;related share options. Moreover, the omission of an expense for fixed share options impairs the quality of financial statements: </p><lq> <p id="IFRS02_P2403" base="SL156735">The resulting financial statements are less credible than they could be, and the financial statements of entities that use fixed employee share options extensively are not comparable to those of entities that do not make significant use of fixed options.
