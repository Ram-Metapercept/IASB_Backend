Therefore, no matter what value is attributed to the first asset (services received), eventually it will be necessary to recognise the change in assets when the second asset (cash) is disbursed. Thus, no matter how the transaction is accounted for between the receipt of services and the settlement in cash, it will be &#x2018;trued up&#x2019; to equal the amount of cash paid out, to account for both changes in assets.</p></body></paragraph>
