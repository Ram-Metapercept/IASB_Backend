For example, such an approach does not take into account the correlation between the share price and early exercise. It would also mean that the share option valuation does not take into account the possibility that the option might be exercised at a date that is later than the end of its expected life. Therefore, in many instances, a more flexible model, such as a binomial model, that uses the share option&#x2019;s contractual life as an input and takes into account the possibility of early exercise on a range of different dates in the option&#x2019;s life, allowing for factors such as the correlation between the share price and early exercise and expected employee turnover, is likely to produce a more accurate estimate of the option&#x2019;s fair value.</p></body></paragraph>
