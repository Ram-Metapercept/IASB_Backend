This implies that it is not necessary to identify the specific goods or services received in return for the equity instruments granted to conclude that goods or services have been (or will be) received. Furthermore, <xref id="IFRS02_X0886" base="F15998403" href="IFRS02_8.dita#IFRS02_8">paragraph 8</xref> of the IFRS establishes that it is not necessary for the goods or services received to qualify for recognition as an asset in order for the share&#x2011;based payment to be within the scope of IFRS 2. In this case, the IFRS requires the cost of the goods or services received or receivable to be recognised as expenses.</p></body></paragraph>
