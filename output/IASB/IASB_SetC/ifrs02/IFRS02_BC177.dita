This is consistent with the Board&#x2019;s objective of setting principles&#x2011;based standards. The measurement objective is to estimate fair value. That objective might not be achieved if detailed, prescriptive rules were specified, which would probably become outdated by future developments in valuation methodologies.</p></body></paragraph>
