Potential diversity in practice had emerged because some were of the view that if share based payment awards are granted to employees conditional on the entity-wide profit, it is not clear that the profit target constitutes a performance condition on the basis that the employee might have so little influence on the entity-wide profit that it is not clear whether the target is able to sufficiently incentivise an individual employee&#x2019;s actions. Others held the view that because the entity is in business in order to make a profit, it is reasonable to assume that all employees contribute directly or indirectly to the entity-wide profit, ie that the whole body of employees contribute towards the entity-wide profit.</p></body></paragraph>
