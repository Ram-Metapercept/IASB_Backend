The Board noted that a share&#x2011;based payment vests when the counterparty&#x2019;s entitlement to it is no longer conditional on future service or performance conditions. Therefore, conditions such as non&#x2011;compete provisions and transfer restrictions, which apply after the counterparty has become entitled to the share&#x2011;based payment, are not vesting conditions. The Board revised the definition of &#x2018;vest&#x2019; accordingly.</p></body></paragraph>
