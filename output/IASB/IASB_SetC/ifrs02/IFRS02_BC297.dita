Other estimates, such as employee pension costs, will ultimately be revised to equal the amount of the cash paid out. In contrast, because equity is not remeasured, if the estimated fair value of employee share options is recognised, there is no remeasurement of the fair value estimate&#x2014;unless exercise date measurement is used&#x2014;so any estimation error is permanently embedded in the financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
