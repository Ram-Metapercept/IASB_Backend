Furthermore, the Board noted that no non&#x2011;arbitrary or unambiguous criteria exist to distinguish between a decision by the counterparty not to meet a non&#x2011;vesting condition and a cancellation by the entity. The Board considered establishing a rebuttable presumption that a counterparty&#x2019;s failure to meet a non&#x2011;vesting condition is (or is not) a cancellation, unless it can be demonstrated that the entity had no (or had some) influence over the counterparty&#x2019;s decision. The Board did not believe that the information about the entity&#x2019;s decision&#x2011;making processes that is publicly available would be sufficient to determine whether the presumption has been rebutted. Therefore, the Board concluded that a failure to meet a non&#x2011;vesting condition should be treated as a cancellation when either the entity or the counterparty can choose whether that non&#x2011;vesting condition is met.</p></body></paragraph>
