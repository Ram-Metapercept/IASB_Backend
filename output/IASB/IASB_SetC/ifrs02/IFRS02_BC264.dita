By electing to receive cash rather than equity instruments, the employee has surrendered his/her rights to receive equity instruments. That event does not cause a change in net assets and hence there is no change in total equity. This is consistent with the Board&#x2019;s conclusions on other lapses of equity instruments (see <xref id="IFRS02_X0978" base="F15998796" href="IFRS02_BC218.dita#IFRS02_BC218">paragraphs BC218&#x2013;BC221</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
