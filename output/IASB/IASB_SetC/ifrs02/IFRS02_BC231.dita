If the entity instead cancelled the existing share options and then issued what were, in effect, replacement share options, but treated the replacement share options as a new share option grant, this could reduce the expense recognised. Although the new grant would be valued at CU10 rather than incremental value of CU8, the entity would not recognise any further expense in respect of the original share option grant, valued at CU20. Although some regard such a result as appropriate (and consistent with their views on repricing, as explained in <xref id="IFRS02_X0965" base="F15998754" href="IFRS02_BC227.dita#IFRS02_BC227">paragraph BC227</xref>), it is inconsistent with the Board&#x2019;s treatment of repricing.</p></body></paragraph>
