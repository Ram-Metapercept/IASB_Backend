Consequently a transaction with such a net settlement feature would be divided into two components and each component would be accounted for consistently with how it is settled (View 1). Consequently, the component that reflects the entity&#x2019;s obligation to pay cash to the tax authority would be accounted for as a cash-settled share-based payment and the component that reflects the entity&#x2019;s obligation to issue equity instruments to the employee would be accounted for as an equity-settled share-based payment.</p></body></paragraph>
