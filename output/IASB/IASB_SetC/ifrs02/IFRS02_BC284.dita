Comments from the FASB, in the SFAS 123 Basis for Conclusions, and from the Canadian AcSB when it developed a standard based on SFAS 123, indicate that both standard&#x2011;setters regard it as inadequate, because it permits a choice between recognition and disclosure. (This issue is discussed further below.) The FASB added to its agenda in March 2003 a project to review US accounting requirements on share&#x2011;based payment, including removing the disclosure alternative in SFAS 123, so that expense recognition is mandatory. The Chairman of the FASB commented:</p><lq>       <p id="IFRS02_P2416" base="SL156738">Recent events have served as a reminder to all of us that         clear, credible and comparable financial information is essential to the health and vitality         of our capital market system. In the wake of the market meltdown and corporate reporting         scandals, the FASB has received numerous requests from individual and institutional         investors, financial analysts and many others urging the Board to mandate the expensing of         the compensation cost relating to employee stock options &#x2026; While a number of major         companies have voluntarily opted to reflect these costs as an expense in reporting their         earnings, other companies continue to show these costs in the footnotes to their financial         statements. In addition, a move to require an expense treatment would be consistent with the         FASB&#x2019;s commitment to work toward convergence between U.S. and international         accounting standards. In taking all of these factors into consideration, the Board concluded         that it was critical that it now revisit this important subject.
