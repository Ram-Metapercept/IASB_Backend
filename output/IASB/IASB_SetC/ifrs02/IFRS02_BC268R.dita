Accordingly, on a cumulative basis, no amount is recognised for goods or services if the equity instruments do not vest because of failure to satisfy a vesting condition other than a market condition as defined in <xref id="IFRS02_X0996" base="F15998874" href="IFRS02_APPA.dita#IFRS02_APPA">Appendix A</xref>. Applying the principles in <xref id="IFRS02_X0997" base="F15998875" href="IFRS02_19.dita#IFRS02_19">paragraph 19</xref>, the IFRIC concluded that when the employee fails to satisfy a vesting condition other than a market condition, the services from that employee recognised in the financial statements of each group entity during the vesting period should be reversed.</p></body></paragraph>
