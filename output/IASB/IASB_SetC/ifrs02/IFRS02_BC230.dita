For example, suppose an entity grants at&#x2011;the&#x2011;money share options with an estimated fair value of CU20 each. Suppose the share price falls, so that the share options become significantly out of the money, and are now worth CU2 each. Suppose the entity is considering repricing, so that the share options are again at the money, which would result in them being worth, say, CU10 each. (Note that the share options are still worth less than at grant date, because the share price is now lower. Other things being equal, an at&#x2011;the&#x2011;money option on a low priced share is worth less than an at&#x2011;the&#x2011;money option on a high priced share.)</p></body></paragraph>
