When addressing defined benefit plans that share risks between entities under common control, IAS 19 requires an expense to be recognised by the subsidiary on the basis of the cash amount charged by the group plan. When there are no repayment arrangements, in the separate or individual financial statements, the subsidiary should recognise a cost equal to its contribution payable for the period. This is consistent with Approach 2 described in <xref id="IFRS02_X0987" base="F15998835" href="IFRS02_BC268H.dita#IFRS02_BC268H">paragraph BC268H</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
