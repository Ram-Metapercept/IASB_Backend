This is because in the proposed definition, the performance target was defined by reference to the performance of the entity, that is, by reference to the entity&#x2019;s own operations (or activities) or the price (or value) of its equity instruments. Some other respondents also raised some difficulties that they expected to encounter when applying the proposed guidance. In this respect, the respondents stated that determining whether a performance target is within the influence of the employee would be difficult to apply in the case of a group of entities; for example, the profit or share price of a group of companies could be seen to be &#x2018;remote from the influence of&#x2019; an employee of a particular subsidiary of the group.</p></body></paragraph>
