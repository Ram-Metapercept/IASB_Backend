In addition, <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards</ph></ph> did not amend the guidance on classification of financial instruments in IFRS 2. Therefore the Board does not expect the amendment to the footnote in IFRS 2 to have a significant effect on the application of this Standard.</p></body></paragraph>
