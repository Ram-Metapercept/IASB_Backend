The repurchase of shares and their subsequent reissue or transfer to other parties are transactions with equity participants that should be recognised as changes in equity. In accounting terms, there is no difference between shares that are repurchased and cancelled, and shares that are repurchased and held by the entity. In both cases, the repurchase involves an outflow of resources to shareholders (ie a distribution), thereby reducing shareholders&#x2019; investment in the entity. Similarly, there is no difference between a new issue of shares and an issue of shares previously repurchased and held in treasury. In both cases, there is an inflow of resources from shareholders, thereby increasing shareholders&#x2019; investment in the entity. Although accounting practice in some jurisdictions treats own shares held as assets, this is not consistent with the definition of assets in the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph> and the conceptual frameworks of other standard&#x2011;setters, as explained in the Discussion Paper (footnote to paragraph 4.7 of the Discussion Paper, reproduced earlier in the footnote to <xref id="IFRS02_X1028" base="F15999404" href="IFRS02_BC73.dita#IFRS02_BC73">paragraph BC73</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
