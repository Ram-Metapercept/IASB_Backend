However, in some situations it might be difficult to demonstrate that the entity has received goods or services. This raises the question of whether IFRS 2 applies to such transactions. In addition, if the entity has made a share&#x2011;based payment and the identifiable consideration received (if any) appears to be less than the fair value of the share&#x2011;based payment, does this situation indicate that goods or services have been received, even though those goods or services are not specifically identified, and therefore that IFRS 2 applies?</p></body></paragraph>
