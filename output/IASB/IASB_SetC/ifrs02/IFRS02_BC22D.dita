Consequently, IFRS 2 applies even when the entity receiving the goods or services has no obligation to settle the transaction and regardless of whether the payments to the suppliers are equity&#x2011;settled or cash&#x2011;settled. To avoid the need for further guidance on the scope of IFRS 2 for group transactions, the Board decided to amend some of the defined terms and to supersede paragraph 3 by a new <xref id="IFRS02_X0890" base="F15998437" href="IFRS02_3A.dita#IFRS02_3A">paragraph 3A</xref> to state clearly the principles applicable to those transactions.</p></body></paragraph>
