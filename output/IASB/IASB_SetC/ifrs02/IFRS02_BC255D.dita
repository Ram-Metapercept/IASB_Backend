The portion that the entity withholds, and for which it incurs a liability to transfer cash (or other assets) to the tax authority, should be accounted for as a cash-settled share-based payment transaction. The portion of the share-based payment that the entity settles by issuing equity instruments to the employee is accounted for as an equity-settled share-based payment.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS02_P2334" base="F49527326">View 2&#x2014;The entire share-based payment transaction should be classified as an equity-settled share-based payment transaction, because the net settlement should be viewed as if the entity had repurchased some of the equity instruments issued to the employee (ie the entity would apply the requirements in paragraph 29 of IFRS 2 for a repurchase of vested equity instruments).</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
