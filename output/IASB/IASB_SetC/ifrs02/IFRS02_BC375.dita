When applying IFRS 2, an entity is required to measure fair value in accordance with that Standard (and not in accordance with IFRS 13) for cash-settled and equity-settled awards. Consequently, the Board decided to add paragraphs 33A&#x2013;33D on how market and non-market vesting conditions and non-vesting conditions should be reflected in the measurement of a cash-settled share-based payment transaction. The Board decided that those conditions should be reflected in the measurement of cash-settled share-based payments in a manner consistent with how they are reflected in the measurement of an equity-settled share-based payment transaction.</p></body></paragraph>
