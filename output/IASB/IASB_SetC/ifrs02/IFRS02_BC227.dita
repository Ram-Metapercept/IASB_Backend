Under this view, the entity would cease using the grant date fair value of the share options when measuring services received after the repricing date, but without reversal of amounts recognised previously. The entity would then measure the services received between the date of repricing and the end of the vesting period by reference to the fair value of the modified share options, measured at the date of repricing. If the repricing occurs after the end of the vesting period, the same process applies. That is to say, there is no adjustment to previously recognised amounts, and the entity recognises&#x2014;either immediately or over the vesting period, depending on whether the employees are required to complete an additional period of service to become entitled to the repriced share options&#x2014;an amount equal to the fair value of the modified share options, measured at the date of repricing.</p></body></paragraph>
