In December 2007 the Board published <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Group Cash&#x2011;settled Share&#x2011;based Payment Transactions</ph></ph> (proposed amendments to IFRS 2). The resulting amendments issued in June 2009 also incorporate the requirements of two Interpretations&#x2014;IFRIC 8 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Scope of IFRS 2</ph></ph> and IFRIC 11 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">IFRS 2&#x2014;Group and Treasury Share Transactions</ph></ph>. As a consequence, the Board withdrew both Interpretations.</p></body></paragraph>
