Imprecision in those estimates does not justify failure to recognize         compensation cost stemming from employee stock options. That belief underlies the         Board&#x2019;s encouragement to entities to adopt the fair value based method of recognizing         stock&#x2011;based employee compensation cost in their financial statements.
