SFAS 123 makes it clear that the FASB decided to permit the disclosure&#x2011;based alternative for political reasons, not because it thought that it was the best accounting solution:</p><lq>       <p id="IFRS02_P2408" base="SL156737">&#x2026; the Board &#x2026; continues to believe that         disclosure is not an adequate substitute for recognition of assets, liabilities, equity,         revenues and expenses in financial statements &#x2026; The Board chose a         disclosure&#x2011;based solution for stock&#x2011;based employee compensation to bring         closure to the divisive debate on this issue&#x2013;not because it believes that solution is         the best way to improve financial accounting and reporting.</p>       <p id="IFRS02_P2409" base="F7871091">(SFAS 123, paragraphs 61 and 62)</p>     </lq></body></paragraph>
