The Board concluded that, in rare cases only, in which the entity could not estimate reliably the grant date fair value of the equity instruments granted, the entity should measure the equity instruments at intrinsic value, initially at grant date and subsequently at each reporting date until the final settlement of the share&#x2011;based payment arrangement, with the effects of the remeasurement recognised in profit or loss. For a grant of share options, the share&#x2011;based payment arrangement is finally settled when the share options are exercised, are forfeited (eg upon cessation of employment) or lapse (eg at the end of the option&#x2019;s life). For a grant of shares, the share&#x2011;based payment arrangement is finally settled when the shares vest or are forfeited. This requirement would apply to all entities, including listed and unlisted entities.</p></body></paragraph>
