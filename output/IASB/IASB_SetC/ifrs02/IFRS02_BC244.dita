For example, it could be argued that an entity has no liability for pension payments to employees until the employees have met the specified vesting conditions. This argument was considered by IASC in <xref id="IFRS02_X0967" base="F77794350" href="../ias19/IAS19_TOC0001.dita#IAS19_TOC0001">IAS 19 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Employee Benefits</ph></ph></xref>.

For example, consider an enterprise that provides a benefit of 100 to employees who remain in service for two years. At the end of the first year, the employee and the enterprise are not in the same position as at the beginning of the first year, because the employee will only need to work for one year, instead of two, before becoming entitled to the benefit. Although there is a possibility that the benefit may not vest, that difference is an obligation and, in the Board&#x2019;s view, should result in the recognition of a liability at the end of the first year. The measurement of that obligation at its present value reflects the enterprise&#x2019;s best estimate of the probability that the benefit may not vest.
