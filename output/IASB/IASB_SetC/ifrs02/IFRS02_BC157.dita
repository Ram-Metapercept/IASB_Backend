Therefore, by imposing the restriction on transferability, the entity has caused the option holder to exercise the option early, thereby resulting in the loss of time value. For example, one aspect of time value is the value of the right to defer payment of the exercise price until the end of the option term. If the option is exercised early because of non&#x2011;transferability, the entity receives the exercise price much earlier than it would otherwise have done.</p></body></paragraph>
