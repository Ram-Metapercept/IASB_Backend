The Board decided that it was not necessary to include additional examples (other than adding paragraph IG19B and IG Example 12C which illustrates the application of paragraphs B44A&#x2013;B44C), because the existing implementation guidance in IFRS 2 could be applied by analogy. For example, Example 9 illustrates a grant of shares to which a cash settlement alternative is subsequently added.</p></body></paragraph>
