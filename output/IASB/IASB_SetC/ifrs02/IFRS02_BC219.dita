The lapsing of the share option does not represent a gain to the entity, because there is no change to the entity&#x2019;s net assets. In other words, although some might see such an event as being a benefit to the remaining shareholders, it has no effect on the entity&#x2019;s financial position. In effect, one type of equity interest (the share option holders&#x2019; interest) becomes part of another type of equity interest (the shareholders&#x2019; interest). The Board therefore concluded that the only accounting entry that might be required is a movement within equity, to reflect that the share options are no longer outstanding (ie as a transfer from one type of equity interest to another).</p></body></paragraph>
