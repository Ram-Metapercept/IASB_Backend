In other words, in deciding how many share options to grant in total, the entity would allow for expected forfeitures. Hence, if the objective is to estimate at grant date the fair value of the entity&#x2019;s commitments under the share option agreement, that valuation should take into account that the entity&#x2019;s commitment to fulfil its side of the option agreement is conditional upon the vesting conditions being satisfied.</p></body></paragraph>
