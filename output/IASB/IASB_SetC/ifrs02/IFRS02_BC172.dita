The employees have to satisfy the vesting conditions to fulfil their side of the arrangement. In other words, the employees&#x2019; performance of their side of the arrangement is what they do to pay for their share options. Employees do not pay for the options with cash, as do the holders of traded share options; they pay with their services. Having to pay for the share options does not make them less valuable. On the contrary, it proves that the share options are valuable.</p></body></paragraph>
