Some argue that, given the uncertainties relating to estimating the fair value of employee share options, it is better for all entities to report zero, because this will make financial statements more comparable. They argue that if, for example, for two entities the &#x2018;true&#x2019; amount of expense relating to employee share options is CU500,000, and estimation uncertainties cause one entity to report CU450,000 and the other to report CU550,000, the two entities&#x2019; financial statements would be more comparable if both reported zero, rather than these divergent figures.</p></body></paragraph>
