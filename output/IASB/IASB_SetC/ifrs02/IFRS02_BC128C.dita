However, when the value of the identifiable consideration received appears to be less than the fair value of the share&#x2011;based payment, measurement of both the goods or the services received and the share&#x2011;based payment may be necessary in order to measure the value of the unidentifiable goods or services received.</p></body></paragraph>
