The Board observed that paragraphs 19&#x2013;21A of IFRS 2 provide the requirements for measuring the fair value of equity-settled share-based payment transactions that include vesting and non-vesting conditions. The Board also observed that, in the case of cash-settled share-based payment transactions, paragraph 33 of IFRS 2 requires an entity to measure the liability, initially and at the end of each reporting period until settled, at fair value. The entity is required to apply an option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions on which the cash-settled share-based payments were granted and the extent to which the employees have rendered service to date.</p></body></paragraph>
