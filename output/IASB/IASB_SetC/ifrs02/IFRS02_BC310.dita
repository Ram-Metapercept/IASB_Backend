The Board therefore concluded that, in general, the IFRS on share&#x2011;based payment should require a fair value measurement method to be applied to all types of share&#x2011;based payment transactions, including all types of employee share&#x2011;based payment. Hence, the Board concluded that the IFRS should not allow a choice between a fair value measurement method and an intrinsic value measurement method, and should not permit a choice between recognition and disclosure of expenses arising from employee share&#x2011;based payment transactions.</p></body></paragraph>
