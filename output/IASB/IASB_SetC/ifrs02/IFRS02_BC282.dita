That included permitting a choice between fair value&#x2011;based accounting for employee stock&#x2011;based compensation expense in the income statement and disclosure of pro forma amounts in the notes to both interim and annual financial statements. However, the AcSB recently amended its standard to remove the choice between recognition and disclosure, and therefore expense recognition is mandatory for financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2004.</p></body></paragraph>
