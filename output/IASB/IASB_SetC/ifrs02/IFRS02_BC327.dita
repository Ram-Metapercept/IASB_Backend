First, the above allocation method ensures that the total tax benefits recognised in the income statement in respect of a particular share&#x2011;based payment transaction do not exceed the tax benefits ultimately received. The Board disagreed with the approach in SFAS 123, which sometimes results in the total tax benefits recognised in the income statement exceeding the tax benefits ultimately received because, in some situations, SFAS 123 permits the unrecovered portion of the deferred tax asset to be written off to equity.</p></body></paragraph>
