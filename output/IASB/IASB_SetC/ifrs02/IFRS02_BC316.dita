Conversely, if the tax deduction is less than the total expense recognised for accounting purposes, the write&#x2011;off of the related deferred tax asset in excess of the benefits of the tax deduction is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that there is remaining additional paid&#x2011;in capital from excess tax deductions from previous share&#x2011;based payment transactions (SFAS 123, paragraph 44).</p></body></paragraph>
