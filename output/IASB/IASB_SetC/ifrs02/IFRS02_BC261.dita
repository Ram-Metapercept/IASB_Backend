This is consistent with the approach adopted in <xref base="F15998795" href="../ias32/IAS32_TOC.dita#IAS32_TOC0001" id="IFRS02_X0977">IAS 32</xref>, whereby the liability component is measured first and the residual is allocated to equity. If the fair value of each settlement alternative is always the same, then the fair value of the equity component of the compound instrument will be zero and hence the fair value of the compound instrument will be the same as the fair value of the liability component.</p></body></paragraph>
