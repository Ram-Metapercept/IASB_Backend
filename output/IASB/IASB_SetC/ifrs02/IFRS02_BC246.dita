If the entity&#x2019;s share price increased over the vesting period, expenses would be larger in later reporting periods compared with earlier reporting periods. This is because each reporting period will include the effects of (a) an increase in the liability in respect of the employee services received during that reporting period and (b) an increase in the liability attributable to the increase in the entity&#x2019;s share price during the reporting period, which increases the amount payable in respect of past employee services received.</p></body></paragraph>
