Before the Board&#x2019;s amendments, the guidance in paragraph 3 (now superseded by <xref id="IFRS02_X0892" base="F15998439" href="IFRS02_3A.dita#IFRS02_3A">paragraph 3A</xref>) stated that when a shareholder transferred equity instruments of the entity (or another group entity), the transaction would be within the scope of IFRS 2 for the entity receiving the goods or services. However, that guidance did not specify the accounting by a shareholder transferor. The Board noted that the defined terms in <xref id="IFRS02_X0893" base="F15998440" href="IFRS02_APPA.dita#IFRS02_APPA">Appendix A</xref>, as amended, would clearly state that any entity (including a joint venture) that receives goods or services in a share&#x2011;based payment transaction should account for the transaction in accordance with the IFRS, regardless of whether that entity also settles the transaction.</p></body></paragraph>
