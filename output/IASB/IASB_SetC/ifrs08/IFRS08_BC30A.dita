In addition, determining whether operating segments have similar economic characteristics requires the use of judgement.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS08_P0456" base="F29360728"><xref id="IFRS08_X0264" base="F35713535" href="IFRS08_g22-22.dita#IFRS08_g22-22/IFRS08_g22-22_TI">paragraph 22(a)</xref> currently contains a requirement to disclose the factors used to identify the entity&#x2019;s reportable segments, including the basis of organisation, and suggests, as an example, disclosing whether operating segments have been aggregated. However, there is no explicit, or indeed apparent, requirement in paragraph 22(a) to disclose the aggregation of operating segments.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
