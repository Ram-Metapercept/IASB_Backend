The objective of such additional disclosure would be to promote greater transparency in the management of amounts paid by the oil, gas and mining industries to governments in developing or transitional countries that are resource&#x2011;rich. The view of these campaigners was that publication of specific payments made by those companies to governments is in the interest of all users of financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
