The required disclosures need be provided only if they are not included as part of the disclosures about segments. The Exposure Draft proposed requiring additional disclosures about products and services and geographic areas <i>by segment</i>. Many respondents said that that proposal would have resulted in disclosure of excessive amounts of information. Some enterprises providing a variety of products and services throughout many countries, for example, would have been required to present a large quantity of information that would have been time&#x2011;consuming to prepare and of questionable benefit to most financial statement users. The Board decided that additional disclosures provided on an enterprise&#x2011;wide basis rather than on a segment basis would be appropriate and not unduly burdensome. The Board also agreed that those enterprise&#x2011;wide disclosures are appropriate for all enterprises including those that have a single operating segment if the enterprise offers a range of products and services, derives revenues from customers in more than one country, or both.</p></body></paragraph>
