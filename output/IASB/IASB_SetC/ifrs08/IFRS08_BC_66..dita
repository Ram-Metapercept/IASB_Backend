Some specifically recommended adoption of the proposal in the IASC Exposure Draft that was commonly referred to as a &#x201C;safety net.&#x201D; The IASC Exposure Draft approach to identifying primary and secondary operating segments calls for review of management&#x2019;s organization of segments, but both primary and secondary segments are required to be defined either on the basis of related products and services or on the basis of geography. That is, regardless of management&#x2019;s organization, segments must be grouped either by related products and services or by geographic areas, and one set must be presented as primary segments and the other as secondary segments.</p></body></paragraph>
