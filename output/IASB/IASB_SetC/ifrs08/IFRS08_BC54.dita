They expressed the view that such information would be relevant when a large proportion of an entity&#x2019;s business is carried out in its country of domicile. They noted, however, that in many circumstances the country of domicile represents a small proportion of the entity&#x2019;s business and in these cases the information required would not be relevant. In addition, they argued that SFAS 131 had been designed for entities in the US, for whom the &#x2018;country of domicile&#x2019; is in itself a significant geographical area. These respondents suggested that disclosures should instead be required about the country of principal activities.</p></body></paragraph>
