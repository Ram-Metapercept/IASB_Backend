Items of revenue and expense directly attributable to a segment need not be included in the reported profit or loss of that segment, and allocation of items not directly attributable to any given segment is not required. Messrs G&#x00E9;lard and Leisenring believe that the IFRS should require amounts directly incurred by or directly attributable to a segment to be included in that segment&#x2019;s profit or loss, and measurement of a segment&#x2019;s profit or loss to be consistent with the attribution of assets to the segment.</p></body></paragraph>
