This clarification would make this paragraph consistent with <xref id="IFRS08_X0272" base="F35713538" href="IFRS08_g23-24.dita#IFRS08_g23-24/IFRS08_g23-24_TI">paragraphs 23</xref> and <xref id="IFRS08_X0273" base="F35713539" href="IFRS08_g28-28.dita#IFRS08_g28-28/IFRS08_g28-28_TI">28(d)</xref>. The Board agreed with the request and decided to modify paragraph 28(c) to achieve this.</p></body></paragraph>
