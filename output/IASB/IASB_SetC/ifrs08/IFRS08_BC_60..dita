First, an ability to see an enterprise &#x201C;through the eyes of management&#x201D; enhances a user&#x2019;s ability to predict actions or reactions of management that can significantly affect the enterprise&#x2019;s prospects for future cash flows. Second, because information about those segments is generated for management&#x2019;s use, the incremental cost of providing information for external reporting should be relatively low. Third, practice has demonstrated that the term <i>industry</i> is subjective. Segments based on an existing internal structure should be less subjective.</p></body></paragraph>
