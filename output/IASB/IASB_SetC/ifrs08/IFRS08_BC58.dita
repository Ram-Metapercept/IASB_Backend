Some respondents noted that this could be difficult when entities are state&#x2011;controlled. The Board noted that it was considering proposals to amend IAS 24 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Related Party Disclosures</ph></ph> with regard to state&#x2011;controlled entities, and a consequential amendment to the IFRS on reporting segments might result from those proposals. In the meantime, the Board decided to require in the IFRS that a government (whether national, state, provincial, territorial, local or foreign) and entities known to the reporting entity to be controlled by that government should be treated as a single customer. This makes the requirements relating to government&#x2011;controlled entities the same as those relating to privately controlled entities.</p></body></paragraph>
