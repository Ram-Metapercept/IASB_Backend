If we could obtain reports showing the details of how an individual business firm is organized and managed, we would assume more responsibility for making meaningful comparisons of those data to the unlike data of other firms that conduct their business differently. [pages 60 and 61]</p></lq><p id="IFRS08_P0545" base="F1261744">Almost all of the users and many other constituents who responded to the Exposure Draft or who met with Board and staff members agreed that defining segments based on the structure of an enterprise&#x2019;s internal organization would result in improved information. They said that not only would enterprises be likely to report more detailed information but knowledge of the structure of an enterprise&#x2019;s internal organization is valuable in itself because it highlights the risks and opportunities that management believes are important.</p></body></paragraph>
