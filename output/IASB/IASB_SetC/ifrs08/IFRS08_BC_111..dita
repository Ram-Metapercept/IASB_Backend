Some form of relief for single&#x2011;product or single&#x2011;service segments was explored; however, there are many enterprises that produce a single product or a single service that are required to issue general&#x2011;purpose financial statements. Those statements would include the same information that would be reported by single&#x2011;product or single&#x2011;service segments of an enterprise. The Board concluded that it was not necessary to provide an exemption for single&#x2011;product or single&#x2011;service segments because enterprises that produce a single product or service that are required to issue general&#x2011;purpose financial statements have that same exposure to competitive harm. The Board noted that concerns about competitive harm were addressed to the extent feasible by four changes made during redeliberations: (a) modifying the aggregation criteria, (b) adding quantitative materiality thresholds for identifying reportable segments, (c) eliminating the requirements to disclose research and development expense and liabilities by segment, and (d) changing the second&#x2011;level disclosure requirements about products and services and geography from a segment basis to an enterprise&#x2011;wide basis.</p></body></paragraph>
