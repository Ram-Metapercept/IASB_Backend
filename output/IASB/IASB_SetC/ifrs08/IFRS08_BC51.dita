For example, some preferred disclosures by geographical areas rather than by individual country. Others favoured geographical disclosure of profit or loss as well as non&#x2011;current assets. Several respondents expressed the view that disclosure of total assets would be more relevant than non&#x2011;current assets. Some took the view that disclosures should be made of both current and non&#x2011;current assets. Other respondents recommended that financial assets should be disclosed as well as non&#x2011;current assets. Some respondents expressed the view that disclosure of non&#x2011;current assets should not be required if those amounts are not reviewed by the chief operating decision maker.</p></body></paragraph>
