It requires quantitative thresholds to be aggregated only if aggregation is consistent with the objective and core principles of SFAS 131, the segments have similar economic characteristics, and the segments share a majority of the aggregation criteria listed in paragraph 17(a)&#x2013;(e) of SFAS 131. The Board agreed with the approach adopted in EITF 04&#x2011;10 and concluded that the same requirement should be included in the IFRS.</p></body></paragraph>
