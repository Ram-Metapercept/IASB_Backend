However, the flow chart in <xref id="IFRS08_X0260" base="F15835514" href="IFRS08_gIG7-IG7.dita#IFRS08_gIG7-IG7">paragraph IG7 of the implementation guidance</xref> indicates that the aggregation criteria take precedence over the quantitative thresholds. The Board also noted that the wording in SFAS 131 was clear because the paragraph on aggregation refers to aggregation into a &#x2018;single operating segment&#x2019;. The quantitative thresholds then determine which operating segments are reportable segments. The term &#x2018;operating&#x2019; has been inserted in <xref id="IFRS08_X0261" base="F15835515" href="IFRS08_g12-12.dita#IFRS08_g12-12">paragraph 12</xref> of the IFRS.</p></body></paragraph>
