The Board considers that concern to be overstated for several reasons. Although this Statement requires disclosure of more information about an individual operating segment than Statement 14 required for an industry segment, this Statement requires disclosure of information about only one type of segment&#x2013;reportable operating segments&#x2014;while Statement 14 required information about two types of segments&#x2014;industry segments and geographic segments. Moreover, Statement 14 required that many enterprises create information solely for external reporting, while almost all of the segment information that this Statement requires is already available in management reports. The Board recognizes, however, that some enterprises may find it necessary to create the enterprise&#x2011;wide information about products and services, geographic areas, and major customers required by paragraphs 36&#x2013;39.</p></body></paragraph>
