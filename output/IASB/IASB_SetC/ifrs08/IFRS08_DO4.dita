They believe, however, that the definitions of segment revenue, expense, result, assets and liabilities in paragraph 16 of IAS 14 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Segment Reporting</ph></ph> should be retained in the IFRS and applied to segments identified by the management approach. They believe that proper external reporting of segment information should not permit the use of non&#x2011;GAAP measures because they might mislead users.</p></body></paragraph>
