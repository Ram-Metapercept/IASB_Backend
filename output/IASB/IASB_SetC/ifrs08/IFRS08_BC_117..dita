However, the Board acknowledges that the application of that Statement may increase the need for disaggregated information about not&#x2011;for&#x2011;profit organizations. A final Statement expected to result from the FASB Exposure Draft, <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Consolidated Financial Statements: Policy and Procedures</ph></ph>, also may increase that need by requiring aggregation of information about more entities in the financial statements of not&#x2011;for&#x2011;profit organizations.</p></body></paragraph>
