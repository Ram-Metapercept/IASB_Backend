The Board also supported a minimum disclosure of segment profit or loss and segment assets. The Board therefore concluded that measures of segment profit or loss and total segment assets should be disclosed for all segments regardless of whether those measures are reviewed by the chief operating decision maker.</line-through><xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS08_FN0007" type="fn"/></p></body></paragraph>
