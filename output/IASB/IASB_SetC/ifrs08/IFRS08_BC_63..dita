The summary of principal conclusions in FASB Concepts Statement No. 2, <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Qualitative Characteristics of Accounting Information</ph></ph>, says: &#x201C;Comparability between enterprises and consistency in the application of methods over time increases the informational value of comparisons of relative economic opportunities or performance. The significance of information, especially quantitative information, depends to a great extent on the user&#x2019;s ability to relate it to some benchmark.&#x201D; However, Concepts Statement 2 also notes a danger:</p><lq> <p id="IFRS08_P0550" base="F1261749">Improving comparability may destroy or weaken relevance or reliability if, to secure comparability between two measures, one of them has to be obtained by a method yielding less relevant or less reliable information. Historically, extreme examples of this have been provided in some European countries in which the use of standardized charts of accounts has been made mandatory in the interest of interfirm comparability but at the expense of relevance and often reliability as well. That kind of uniformity may even adversely affect comparability of information if it conceals real differences between enterprises. [paragraph 116]</p></lq></body></paragraph>
