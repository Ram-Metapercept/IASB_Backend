In particular, both standards required the accounting policies underlying the disaggregated information to be the same as those underlying the entity information, since segment information was regarded as a disaggregation of the entity information. The approach to segment disclosures in SFAS 14 was criticised for not providing information about segments based on the structure of an entity&#x2019;s internal organisation that could enhance a user&#x2019;s ability to predict actions or reactions of management that could significantly affect the entity&#x2019;s future cash flow prospects.</p></body></paragraph>
