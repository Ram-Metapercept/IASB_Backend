After reconsideration and discussion of the interaction between the disclosure and measurement requirements in the IFRS (<xref base="F15835288" href="IFRS08_23.dita#IFRS08_23" id="IFRS08_X0268">paragraphs 23</xref> and <xref href="IFRS08_g25-30.dita" scope="local" id="IFRS08_X0269">25</xref>), the Board concluded that those reasons no longer reflected its thinking. Therefore, the Board amended paragraph 23 by <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Improvements to IFRSs</ph></ph> issued in April 2009 to clarify that a measure of segment assets should be disclosed only if that amount is regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker.</p></body></paragraph>
