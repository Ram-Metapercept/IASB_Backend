However, some respondents disagreed. They said that retrospective application might be impossible for some entities without the use of hindsight, or could be complex and burdensome in some situations&#x2014;for example, in determining the exact point at which there was evidence of a change in use in prior periods, or in obtaining fair values at transfer dates in the past. Those respondents suggested either prospective application or, alternatively, retrospective application with some practical expedients.</p></body></paragraph>
