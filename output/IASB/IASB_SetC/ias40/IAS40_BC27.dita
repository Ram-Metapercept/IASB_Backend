The Board decided to confirm in <xref id="IAS40_X0512" base="F53347704" href="IAS40_g57-65.dita#IAS40_g57-65/IAS40_g57-65_TI">paragraph 57</xref> that, in isolation, a change in management&#x2019;s intentions would not be enough to support a transfer of property. This is because management&#x2019;s intentions, alone, do not provide evidence of a change in use&#x2014;an entity must have taken observable actions to support such a change.</p></body></paragraph>
