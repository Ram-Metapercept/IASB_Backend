The Board noted that investment property being redeveloped remained in the scope of the Standard and that the exclusion of investment property under construction gave rise to a perceived inconsistency. In addition, the Board concluded that with increasing experience with the use of fair value measures since the Standard was issued, entities were more able to measure reliably the fair value of investment property under construction. Therefore, in the exposure draft of proposed <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Improvements to International Financial Reporting Standards</ph></ph> published in 2007 the Board proposed amending the scope of the Standard to include investment property under construction.</p></body></paragraph>
