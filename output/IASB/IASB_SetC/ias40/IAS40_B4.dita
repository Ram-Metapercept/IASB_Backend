As explained in <xref id="IAS40_X0532" base="F15832906" href="IAS40_B47.dita#IAS40_B47">paragraphs B47&#x2013;B48</xref> below, the Board believes that it is impracticable, at this stage, to require a fair value model for all investment property. At the same time, the Board believes that it is desirable to permit a fair value model. This evolutionary step forward will allow preparers and users to gain greater experience working with a fair value model and will allow time for certain property markets to achieve greater maturity.</p></body></paragraph>
