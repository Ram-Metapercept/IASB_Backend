The definition of investment property requires that such a property is held by the owner or a lessee under a finance lease. As indicated above, the Board agreed to allow a lessee under an operating lease, in specified circumstances, also to be a &#x2018;holder&#x2019;. However, a lessor that has provided a property to a lessee under a finance lease cannot be a &#x2018;holder&#x2019;. Such a lessor has a lease receivable, not an investment property.</p></body></paragraph>
