The comment letters on E64 showed that although many support this step, many others still have significant conceptual and practical reservations about extending a fair value model to non&#x2011;financial assets, particularly (but not exclusively) for entities whose main activity is not to hold property for capital appreciation. Also, some entities feel that certain property markets are not yet sufficiently mature for a fair value model to work satisfactorily. Furthermore, some believe that it is impossible to create a rigorous definition of investment property and that this makes it impracticable to require a fair value model at present.</p></body></paragraph>
