It was issued by the Board of the former International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) in 2000. Apart from the deletion of paragraphs B10&#x2013;B20, B25 and B26, this Basis has not been revised by the IASB&#x2014;those paragraphs are no longer relevant and have been deleted to avoid the risk that they might be read out of context. However, cross&#x2011;references to paragraphs in IAS 40 as issued in 2000 have been marked to show the corresponding paragraphs in IAS 40 as revised by the IASB in 2003 (superseded references are struck through and new references are underlined). Paragraphs are treated as corresponding if they broadly address the same matter even though the guidance may differ. In addition, the text has been annotated where references to material in other standards are no longer valid, following the revision of those standards. Reference should be made to the IASB&#x2019;s Basis for Conclusions on the amendments made in 2003.</p>     </note></body></topic>
