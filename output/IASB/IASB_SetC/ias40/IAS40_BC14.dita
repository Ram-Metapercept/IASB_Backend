The Board acknowledged that this would mean that two parties could both account as if they &#x2018;hold&#x2019; interests in the property. This could occur at various levels of lessees who become lessors in a manner consistent with the definition of an investment property and the election provided for operating leases. Lessees who use the property in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes would not be able to classify that property as an investment property.</p></body></paragraph>
