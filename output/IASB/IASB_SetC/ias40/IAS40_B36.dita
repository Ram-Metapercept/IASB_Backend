The economic performance of a property can be regarded as being made up of both rental income earned during the period (net of expenses) and changes in the value of future net rental income. The fair value of an investment property can be regarded as a market&#x2011;based representation of the value of the future net rental income, regardless of whether the entity is likely to sell the property in the near future. Also, the Standard notes that fair value is determined without deducting costs of disposal&#x2014;in other words, the use of the fair value model is not intended as a representation that a sale could, or should, be made in the near future.<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS40_FN0009" type="fn"/></p></body></paragraph>
