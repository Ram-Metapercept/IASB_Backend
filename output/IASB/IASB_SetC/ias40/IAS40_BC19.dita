In addition, neither IFRS 3 nor IAS 40 contains a limitation in its scope that restricts its application when the other Standard applies, ie there is nothing within the scope of each Standard to suggest that they are mutually exclusive. The Board also noted that the wording of IAS 40 is not sufficiently clear about the interrelationship between the two Standards.</p></body></paragraph>
