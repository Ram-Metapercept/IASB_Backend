They argue that related parties often do not pay rent on an arm&#x2019;s length basis, that it is often difficult to establish whether the rent is consistent with pricing on an arm&#x2019;s length basis and that rental rates may be subject to arbitrary change. They suggest that fair values are less relevant where property is subject to leases that are not priced on an arm&#x2019;s length basis.</p></body></paragraph>
