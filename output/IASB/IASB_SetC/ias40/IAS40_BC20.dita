It amended IAS 40 to state explicitly that judgement is also needed to determine whether the transaction is the acquisition of an asset or a group of assets or is a business combination within the scope of IFRS 3. That judgement is not based on <xref id="IAS40_X0495" base="F35713866" href="IAS40_7.dita#IAS40_7">paragraphs 7&#x2013;14 of IAS 40</xref> but is instead based on the guidance in IFRS 3. Only the judgement needed to distinguish investment property from owner-occupied property is based on those paragraphs.</p></body></paragraph>
