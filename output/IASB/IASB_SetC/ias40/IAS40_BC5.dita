In particular, it considered deleting <ph>paragraph 14 of IAS 17</ph>, so that a long&#x2011;term lease of land would be classified as a finance lease (and hence could qualify as an investment property) when the conditions for finance lease classification in <ph>paragraphs 4&#x2013;13 of IAS 17</ph> are met. However, the Board noted that this would not resolve all cases encountered in practice. Some leasehold interests held for investment would remain classified as operating leases (eg leases with significant contingent rents), and hence could not be investment property in accordance with IAS 40.</p></body></paragraph>
