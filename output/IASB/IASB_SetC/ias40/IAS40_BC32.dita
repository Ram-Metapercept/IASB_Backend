If an entity uses this transition method, the Board decided to require specific disclosure of any reclassification of property at the date of initial application as part of the reconciliation of the carrying amount of investment property that is already required to be provided. This disclosure informs users of financial statements about changes to the carrying amount of investment property at the date of transition that do not reflect an underlying change in use of the property at that date.</p></body></paragraph>
