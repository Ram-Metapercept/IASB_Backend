The arguments for this approach include the following: </p><ol base="SL155205" id="IAS40_L0056" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p base="SL155207" id="IAS40_P0523">the conceptual case for the fair value model is built largely on the view that this provides the most relevant and transparent view of the financial performance of investment property. Given this, it would be inconsistent to permit or require recognition in equity;</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p base="SL155209" id="IAS40_P0524">recognition of fair value changes in equity would create a mismatch because net rental income would be recognised in the income statement, whereas the related consumption of the service potential (recognised as depreciation under <xref base="F16457817" href="../ias16/IAS16_TOC.dita#IAS16_TOC0001" id="IAS40_X0599">IAS 16</xref>) would be recognised in equity. Similarly, maintenance expenditure would be recognised as an expense while related increases in fair value would be recognised in equity;</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p base="SL155211" id="IAS40_P0525">using this approach, there is no need to resolve some difficult and controversial issues that would arise if changes in the fair value of investment property were recognised in equity. These issues include the following:</p> <ol base="SL155212" id="IAS40_L0057" type="lower-roman"><li><li_value>(i)</li_value> <p base="SL155214" id="IAS40_P0526">should fair value changes previously recognised in equity be transferred (&#x201C;recycled&#x201D;) to profit or loss on disposal of investment property; and</p></li><li><li_value>(ii)</li_value> <p base="SL155216" id="IAS40_P0527">should fair value changes previously recognised in equity be transferred (&#x201C;recycled&#x201D;) to profit or loss when investment property is impaired?

It would be undesirable to include two choices in the investment property standard, as this would give entities a choice (at least occasionally) between four different treatments.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
