However, some respondents were concerned that this list appeared to apply only to completed properties and, thus, they suggested that the Board add examples for a change in use of properties under construction or development. In response, the Board decided to amend <xref id="IAS40_X0516" base="F53347748" href="IAS40_57.dita#IAS40_57/IAS40_57_V2">paragraph 57(a)</xref> (ie to include &#x2018;commencement of development with a view to owner-occupation&#x2019;) and <xref id="IAS40_X0517" base="F53347749" href="IAS40_57.dita#IAS40_57/IAS40_57_V2">paragraph 57(d)</xref> (ie to refer to &#x2018;inception&#x2019; of an operating lease, because at this point the construction of the related property might not be complete).</p></body></paragraph>
