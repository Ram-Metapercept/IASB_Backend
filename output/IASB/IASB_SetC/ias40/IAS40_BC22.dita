It considered the provisions for transition and the effective date of the amendment to IAS 40. The Board noted that applying IFRS 3 to transactions that have previously been accounted for as the acquisition of an asset or a group of assets might involve the use of hindsight when determining the fair values, at acquisition date, of the identifiable assets acquired and of the liabilities assumed as part of the business combination transaction. However, it also noted that the amendment is only a clarification of the interrelationship between IFRS 3 and IAS 40. Consequently, it decided that an entity would apply the amendments to IAS 40 prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014, but an entity may choose to apply the amendment to individual transactions that occurred prior to the beginning of the first annual period occurring on or after the effective date only if the information needed is available to the entity.            </p></body></paragraph>
