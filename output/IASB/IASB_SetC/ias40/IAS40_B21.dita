The property does not qualify as investment property in consolidated financial statements that include both entities, because the property is owner&#x2011;occupied from the perspective of the group as a whole. However, from the perspective of the individual entity that owns it, the property is investment property if it meets the definition set out in the Standard.</p></body></paragraph>
