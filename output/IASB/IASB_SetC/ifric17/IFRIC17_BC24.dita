They believed that, once an entity declared a distribution to its owners, it had a contractual obligation to distribute the assets to its owners. However, IAS 39 would not cover dividends payable if they were considered to be non&#x2011;contractual obligations. In addition, IAS 39 covers some but not all obligations that require an entity to deliver non&#x2011;cash assets to another entity. It does not cover a liability to distribute non&#x2011;financial assets to owners. The IFRIC therefore concluded that it was not appropriate to conclude that all dividends payable should be within the scope of IAS 39.</p></body></paragraph>
