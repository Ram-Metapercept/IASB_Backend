They questioned why only the distribution to the controlling entity is excluded from the scope of the Interpretation. The IFRIC noted that when the parent controls the subsidiary before and after the transaction, the entire transaction (including the distribution to the non&#x2011;controlling interest) is not within the scope of the Interpretation and is accounted for in accordance with IAS 27.</p></body></paragraph>
