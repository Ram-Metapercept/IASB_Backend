The IFRIC also noted that the principle on when to recognise a dividend was in the wrong place within the IASB&#x2019;s authoritative documents. The Board agreed with the IFRIC&#x2019;s conclusions and amended IAS 10 as part of its approval of the Interpretation. The Board confirmed that this Interpretation had not changed the principle on when to recognise a dividend payable; however, the principle was moved from IAS 10 into the Interpretation and clarified but without changing the principle.</p></body></paragraph>
