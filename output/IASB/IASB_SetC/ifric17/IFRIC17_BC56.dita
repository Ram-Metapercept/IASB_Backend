The exceptions are situations in which the IFRSs prescribe current measures on an ongoing basis as in IASs 39 and 41 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Agriculture</ph></ph>, or permit them as accounting policy choices as in IASs 16, 38 and 40 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Investment Property</ph></ph>. As a result of its redeliberations, the IFRIC concluded that there was no support in IFRSs for requiring a remeasurement of the assets because of a decision to distribute them. The IFRIC noted that the mismatch concerned arises only with respect to assets that are not carried at fair value already. The IFRIC also noted that the accounting mismatch is the inevitable consequence of IFRSs using different measurement attributes at different times with different triggers for the remeasurement of different assets and liabilities.</p></body></paragraph>
