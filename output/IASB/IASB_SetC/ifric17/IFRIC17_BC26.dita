The IFRIC noted that many respondents were concerned that D23 might imply that the measurement attribute in IAS 37 should always be interpreted to be fair value. This was not the intention of D23 as that question is part of the Board&#x2019;s project to amend IAS 37. In addition, many respondents were not certain whether measuring the dividend payable &#x2018;by reference to&#x2019; the fair value of the assets to be distributed required measurement at their fair value or at some other amount.</p></body></paragraph>
