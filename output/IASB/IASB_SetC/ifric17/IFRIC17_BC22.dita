The IFRIC concluded that other IFRSs were not applicable because most of them addressed only liabilities arising from exchange transactions and some of them were clearly not relevant (eg IAS 12 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Income Taxes</ph></ph>). As mentioned above, the Interpretation addresses only non&#x2011;reciprocal distributions of assets by an entity to its owners.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
