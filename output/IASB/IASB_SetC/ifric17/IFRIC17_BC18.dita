The IFRIC noted that in IAS 10 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Events after the Reporting Period</ph></ph> paragraph 13 states that &#x2018;If dividends are declared (ie the dividends are appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the entity) after the reporting period but before the financial statements are authorised for issue, the dividends are not recognised as a liability at the end of the reporting period because no obligation exists at that time.&#x2019;</p></body></paragraph>
