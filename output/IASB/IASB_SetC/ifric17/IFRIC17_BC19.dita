Therefore, constituents holding this view believe a conflict exists between &#x2018;declared&#x2019; and the explanatory phrase in the brackets in IAS 10 paragraph 13. This is especially true when the sentence is interpreted as &#x2018;declared by <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">management but before the shareholders&#x2019; approval</ph></ph>&#x2019;. The IFRIC concluded that the point at which a dividend is appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the entity will vary by jurisdiction.</p></body></paragraph>
