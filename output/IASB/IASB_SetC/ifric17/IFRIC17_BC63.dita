Therefore, in such jurisdictions there could be a difference between the commitment date (ie the date when management is committed to the dividend) and the obligation date (ie the date when the dividend is approved by the shareholders). On the other hand, some commentators think that, when a distribution requires shareholders&#x2019; approval, the entity cannot be committed until that approval is obtained: in that case, there would be no difference between two dates.</p></body></paragraph>
