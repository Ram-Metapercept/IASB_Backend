The IFRIC did not agree with this conclusion. It noted that in paragraph B2 of IFRS 3 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Business Combinations</ph></ph> (as revised in 2008), the Board concluded that a group of individuals would be regarded as controlling an entity only when, as a result of contractual arrangements, they collectively have the power to govern its financial and operating policies so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In addition, in <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate</ph></ph> in May 2008, the Board clarified in the amendments to IAS 27 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements</ph></ph> that the distribution of equity interests in a new parent to shareholders in exchange for their interests in the existing parent was not a common control transaction.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRIC17_FN0002" type="fn"/></p></body></paragraph>
