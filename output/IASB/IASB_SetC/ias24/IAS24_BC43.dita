Those disclosures are intended to put users on notice that related party transactions have occurred and to give an indication of their extent. The Board did not intend to require the reporting entity to identify <b>every</b> government&#x2011;related entity, or to quantify in detail <b>every</b> transaction with such entities, because such a requirement would negate the exemption.</p></body></paragraph>
