The Board observed that when an associate prepares individual or separate financial statements, its investor is a related party.  If the investor has a subsidiary, that subsidiary is also related to the associate, because the subsidiary is part of the group that has significant influence over the associate.  Although the definition in the 2003 version of IAS 24 incorporated such relationships, the Board concluded that the revised definition should state this more clearly.</p></body></paragraph>
