The Board noted that in some circumstances, users can find sufficient information for their purposes regarding a subsidiary from either its financial statements or the group&#x2019;s consolidated financial statements. In addition, the users of financial statements of a subsidiary often have, or can obtain access to, more information. The Board also noted that users should be aware that amounts recognised in the financial statements of a wholly&#x2011;owned subsidiary can be affected significantly by the subsidiary&#x2019;s relationship with its parent.</p></body></paragraph>
