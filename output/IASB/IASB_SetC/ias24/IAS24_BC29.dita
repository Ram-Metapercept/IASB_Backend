The definition proposed in the 2007 ED would not have rectified these omissions. The Board decided to include these cases in the definition, to treat similar relationships in a consistent manner. In summary, whenever a person or entity has both joint control over a second entity and joint control or significant influence over a third entity, the amendments described in this paragraph and paragraph BC27 treat the second and third entities as related to each other.</p></body></paragraph>
