To avoid confusion and provide consistency, the Board adopted the latter definition when finalising the amendments to IAS 24 in 2009. The Board decided that it need not provide a more comprehensive definition or additional guidance on how to determine what is meant by &#x2018;government&#x2019;. In the Board&#x2019;s view, a more detailed definition could not capture every conceivable government structure across every jurisdiction. In addition, judgement is required by the reporting entity when applying the definition because every jurisdiction has its own way of organising government&#x2011;related activities.</p></body></paragraph>
