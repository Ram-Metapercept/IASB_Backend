The Board understood that divergence existed because some reporting entities do not identify this as a related party transaction. Of those who do identify this as a related party transaction, some reporting entities would disclose the compensation paid by the management entity to those employees or directors of the management entity that act as key management personnel of the reporting entity. Other reporting entities would disclose the service fee that is paid or payable to the management entity, which is incurred by the reporting entity.</p></body></paragraph>
