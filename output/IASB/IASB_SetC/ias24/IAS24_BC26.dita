However, the definition in the 2003 version of IAS 24 did not include the reciprocal of this&#x2014;ie for the financial statements of the investee, the other entity managed by the key management personnel was not a related party. To eliminate this inconsistency, the Board amended the definition so that for both sets of financial statements the entities are related parties.</p></body></paragraph>
