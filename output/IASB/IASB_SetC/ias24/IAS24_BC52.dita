The Board therefore decided to provide relief so that the reporting entity is not required to disclose the components of compensation to key management personnel that is paid through another entity.  Instead, amounts incurred in respect of key management personnel compensation or key management personnel services, paid or payable to another entity, shall be disclosed in accordance with <xref id="IAS24_X0259" base="F35271562" href="IAS24_18A.dita#IAS24_18A/IAS24_18A_V1">paragraph 18A</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
