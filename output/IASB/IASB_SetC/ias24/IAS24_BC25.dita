IAS 24 does not define associates as related to each other if the investor is an entity. This is because there is insufficient influence through the common investment in two associates. However, the Board noted a discrepancy in that if a person significantly influences one entity and a close member of that person&#x2019;s family significantly influences another entity, those entities were treated as related parties of each other. The Board amended the definition to exclude the entities described in the latter scenario, thereby ensuring a consistent treatment of associates.</p></body></paragraph>
