The Board concluded that if the effect of &#x2018;significant voting power&#x2019; was considered to be the same as &#x2018;significant influence&#x2019;, its deletion would have no effect because &#x2018;significant influence&#x2019; is in the definition. On the other hand, if the effect of &#x2018;significant voting power&#x2019; was considered to be different from that of &#x2018;significant influence&#x2019;, IAS 24 did not explain what that difference was.</p></body></paragraph>
