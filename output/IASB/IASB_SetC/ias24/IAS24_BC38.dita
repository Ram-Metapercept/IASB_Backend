However, the main transactions between such a plan and the sponsoring employer are (a) employer contributions and (b) investments by the plan in the employer or in assets used by the employer. <xref id="IAS24_X0243" base="F77793045" href="../ias19/IAS19_TOC0001.dita#IAS19_TOC0001/IAS19_TOC0001_V3">IAS 19</xref> already requires a sponsoring employer to disclose most, if not all, of the information that IAS 24 would require if the exemption did not apply. Thus the Board concluded that no significant loss of disclosure would arise from applying the exemption in these cases.</p></body></paragraph>
