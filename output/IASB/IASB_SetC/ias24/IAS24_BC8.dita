Establishing a disclosure exemption on such a criterion without a definition of the terms could lead to exempting other transactions with management from being disclosed, because they could all be structured as &#x2018;compensation paid in the ordinary course of an entity&#x2019;s operations&#x2019;. Respondents argued that such an exemption could lead to abuse because it could potentially apply to any transactions with management.</p></body></paragraph>
