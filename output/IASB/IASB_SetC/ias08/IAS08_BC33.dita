They argued that this is inappropriate to the extent that a change in an accounting estimate gives rise to changes in assets and liabilities, because the entity&#x2019;s equity does not change as a result. These commentators also argued that it is inappropriate to preclude recognising the effects of changes in accounting estimates directly in equity when that is required or permitted by a Standard or an Interpretation. The Board concurs, and decided to provide an exception  to the requirement described in <xref id="IAS08_X0239" base="F15827221" href="IAS08_BC32.dita#IAS08_BC32">paragraph BC32</xref> for these circumstances.</p></body></paragraph>
