Moreover, the Board decided that balancing costs and benefits is a task for the Board when it sets accounting requirements rather than for entities when they apply those requirements. Therefore, the Board decided to retain the impracticability criterion for exemption in the previous version of IAS 8. This affects the exemptions in <xref id="IAS08_X0225" base="F15826992" href="IAS08_23.dita#IAS08_23">paragraphs 23&#x2013;25</xref>, <xref id="IAS08_X0226" base="F16451280" href="IAS08_g39-40.dita#IAS08_g39-40">39</xref> and <xref id="IAS08_X0227" base="F16451281" href="IAS08_43.dita#IAS08_43">43&#x2013;45</xref> of the Standard. Impracticability is the only basis on which specific exemptions are provided in IFRSs from applying particular requirements when the effect of applying them is material.<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS08_FN0022" type="fn"/></p></body></paragraph>
