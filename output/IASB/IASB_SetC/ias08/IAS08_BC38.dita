If the reference to the <i>Framework</i> had been updated, such entities might have needed to revise those accounting policies twice within a short period of time&#x2014;first, when the 2018 <i>Conceptual Framework</i> comes into effect; and, later, when a new IFRS Standard on rate-regulated activities is issued. In the absence of specific guidance, there might have been uncertainty about what would be acceptable if the 2018 <i>Conceptual Framework</i> was applied. Establishing what would be acceptable might have been costly and the outcome might have been diversity in practice and a loss of trend information for users.</p></body></paragraph>
