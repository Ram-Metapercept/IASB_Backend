Respondents to the Exposure Draft commented that this could <i>require</i> entities to consider the pronouncements of various other standard&#x2011;setting bodies when IASB guidance does not exist. Some commentators argued that, for example, it could require consideration of all components of US GAAP on some topics. After considering these comments, the Board decided that the Standard should indicate that considering such pronouncements is voluntary (see <xref id="IAS08_X0210" base="F15826890" href="IAS08_12.dita#IAS08_12">paragraph 12</xref> of the Standard).</p></body></paragraph>
