For example, it sometimes refers to       inputs used in developing accounting estimates. As discussed in paragraph BC47(b), the Board       specified that the effects on an accounting estimate of a change in an input are changes in       accounting estimates. Therefore, the Board concluded it was unnecessary to also amend       references to the term &#x2018;estimate&#x2019; when that term refers to an input used in developing       accounting estimates.</p></body></paragraph>
