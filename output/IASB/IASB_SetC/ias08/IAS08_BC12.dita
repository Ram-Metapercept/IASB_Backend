As a result, all material prior period errors are accounted for in the same way as a fundamental error was accounted for under the retrospective treatment in the previous version of IAS 8. The Board concluded that the definition of &#x2018;fundamental errors&#x2019; in the previous version was difficult to interpret consistently because the main feature of the definition&#x2014;that the error causes the financial statements of one or more prior periods no longer to be considered to have been reliable&#x2014;was also a feature of all material prior period errors.</p></body></paragraph>
