The Board expected that those changes       would not change the scope of the definition. However, feedback suggested those proposed       changes: <ol type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>           <p>might not improve the definition, because the remaining terms in the definition             would remain undefined and could be open to diverse interpretations; and</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>           <p>might unintentionally narrow the scope of the definition.</p></li></ol>     </p><bodydiv base="IAS2021-1">            </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
