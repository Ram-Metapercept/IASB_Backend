The Board&#x2019;s intention was not to reconsider all of the previous Standard&#x2019;s requirements for selecting and applying accounting policies, and accounting for changes in accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and corrections of errors. Accordingly, this Basis for Conclusions does not discuss requirements in IAS 8 that the Board did not reconsider.</p></body></paragraph>
