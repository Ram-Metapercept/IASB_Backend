As noted above, the Standard does not mandate using pronouncements of other standard&#x2011;setting bodies in any circumstances. Accordingly, the Board decided to clarify that such a change in accounting policy is accounted for and disclosed as a voluntary change in accounting policy (see <xref id="IAS08_X0211" base="F15826891" href="IAS08_21.dita#IAS08_21">paragraph 21</xref> of the Standard). Thus, an entity is precluded from applying transitional provisions specified by the other standard&#x2011;setting body if they are inconsistent with the treatment of voluntary changes in accounting policies specified by the Standard.</p></body></paragraph>
