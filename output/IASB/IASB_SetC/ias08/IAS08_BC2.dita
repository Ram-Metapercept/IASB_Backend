The project was undertaken in the light of queries and criticisms raised in relation to the Standards by securities regulators, professional accountants and other interested parties. The objectives of the Improvements project were to reduce or eliminate alternatives, redundancies and conflicts within Standards, to deal with some convergence issues and to make other improvements. In May 2002 the Board published its proposals in an Exposure Draft of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Improvements to International Accounting Standards</ph></ph>, with a comment deadline of 16 September 2002. The Board received over 160 comment letters on the Exposure Draft.</p></body></paragraph>
