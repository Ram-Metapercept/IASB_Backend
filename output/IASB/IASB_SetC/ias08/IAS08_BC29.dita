The previous version of IAS 8 specified the impracticability exemption for retrospective application of only <i>voluntary</i> changes in accounting policies. Thus, the applicability of the exemption to changes made in accordance with the transitional provisions in an IFRS depended on the text of that IFRS. The Board extended the applicability of the exemption because it decided that the need for the exemption applies equally to all changes in accounting policies applied retrospectively.</p></body></paragraph>
