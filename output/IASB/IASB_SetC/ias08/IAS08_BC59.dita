In particular, the Board assessed that the       benefits of requiring an entity to apply the amendments to changes that occurred in a prior       period would be minimal. Such changes would generally be non-recurring and restatement of       comparative information would often not provide more useful trend information for users of       financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
