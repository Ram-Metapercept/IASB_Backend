The entity is required to disclose that it has not yet applied the IFRS, and known or reasonably estimable information relevant to assessing the possible impact that initial application of the new IFRS will have on the entity&#x2019;s financial statements in the period of initial application (<xref id="IAS08_X0233" base="F15827217" href="IAS08_30.dita#IAS08_30">paragraph 30</xref>). The Standard also includes guidance on specific disclosures the entity should consider when applying this requirement (<xref id="IAS08_X0234" base="F15827218" href="IAS08_31.dita#IAS08_31">paragraph 31</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
