Respondents to the draft amendments and feedback from subsequent outreach       suggested that providing illustrative examples would help entities understand and apply the       amendments. In response to this feedback, the Board added two illustrative examples (Examples       4&#x2013;5). The examples are simple and their aim is limited to helping stakeholders understand how       to apply the definition of accounting estimates, rather than aiming to address specific       application questions.</p></body></paragraph>
