This amendment focuses the requirement on the objective of the disclosure, and, in response to comments on the Exposure Draft that the proposed disclosures were more onerous than the disclosures in US GAAP, clarifies that the Board&#x2019;s intention was to converge with US requirements, rather than to be more onerous.</p>       </li></ol></body></paragraph>
