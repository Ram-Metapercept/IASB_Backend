<paragraph id="IAS08_BC40" base="F75090242"><paranum>BC40</paranum><prolog><data name="standard_number" value="IAS 8"/><data name="paranum" value="BC40"/></prolog><body><p id="IAS08_P0427">The Board based the definition of &#x2018;a regulatory account balance&#x2019; on the definition of &#x2018;a regulatory deferral account balance&#x2019; in IFRS 14, with one difference: the definition of a regulatory account balance does not mention qualifying for deferral. The reference to deferral in IFRS 14 reflects the fact that IFRS 14 permits continued recognition of some regulatory deferral account balances that an entity previously recognised as assets or liabilities immediately before it adopted IFRS Standards for the first time. In contrast, paragraph 54G of IAS 8 applies only when an entity is not applying IFRS 14 but is instead developing an accounting policy after considering paragraph 11 of IAS 8. Paragraph 54G applies regardless of whether that accounting policy results in recognition of any assets or liabilities, and regardless of whether such recognition could be viewed as deferral.</p></body></paragraph>
