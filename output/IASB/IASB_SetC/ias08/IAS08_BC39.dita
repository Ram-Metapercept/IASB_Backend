Instead, entities are required to continue to apply the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph> when developing or revising those accounting policies. Once the Board issues a new IFRS Standard on rate-regulated activities, that prohibition is likely to become unnecessary.</p></body></paragraph>
