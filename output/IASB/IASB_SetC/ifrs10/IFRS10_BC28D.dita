Accordingly, the Board decided that this combination of information is sufficient to support the decision to retain the existing exemption from presenting consolidated financial statements for a subsidiary of an investment entity that is itself a parent entity. The Board noted that requiring an intermediate parent that is a subsidiary of an investment entity to prepare consolidated financial statements could result in significant additional costs, without commensurate benefit. The Board noted that this would be contrary to its intention in requiring investment entities to measure investments at fair value, which was to provide more relevant information at a reduced cost, as described in paragraphs BC309 and BC314 of IFRS 10.</p></body></paragraph>
