Rather than allowing them to fail and facing a loss of reputation, the financial institutions stepped in, and in some cases took control of the vehicles. ED 10 did not make any explicit reference to reputational risk in relation to control because the Board decided that having reputational risk in isolation is not an appropriate basis for consolidation. The term &#x2018;reputational risk&#x2019; relates to the risk that failure of an investee would damage an investee&#x2019;s reputation and, therefore, that of an investor or sponsor, compelling the investor or sponsor to provide support to an investee in order to protect its reputation, even though the investor or sponsor has no legal or contractual requirement to do so.</p></body></paragraph>
