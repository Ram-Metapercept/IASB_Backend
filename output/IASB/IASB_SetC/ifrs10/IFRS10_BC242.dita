For example, a parent entity could use an &#x2018;internal&#x2019; investment entity subsidiary to invest in subsidiaries that may be making losses (eg research and development activities on behalf of the overall group) and would record its investments at fair value, rather than reflecting the underlying activities of the investee. To address these concerns and to emphasise the business purpose of an investment entity, the Board decided to include a requirement that an investment entity, or other members of the group containing the entity, should not obtain benefits from its investees that would be unavailable to other parties that are not related to the investee. In the Board&#x2019;s view, this is one of the factors that differentiate an investment entity from a non-investment entity holding company. If an entity or another member of the group containing the entity obtains benefits from its investees that are unavailable to other investors, then the investment will benefit that entity or the group in some operating or strategic capacity and the entity will therefore not qualify as an investment entity.</p></body></paragraph>
