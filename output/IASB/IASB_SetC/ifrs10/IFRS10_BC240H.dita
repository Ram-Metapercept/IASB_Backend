If so, the subsidiary&#x2019;s activities are considered to be an extension of the parent&#x2019;s core investing activities and the subsidiary would be consolidated in accordance with paragraph 32 of IFRS 10. The Board noted that a subsidiary of an investment entity that provides support services to its parent and other members of the group, such as administration, treasury, payroll and accounting services, is considered to be providing those services as an extension of the operations of the parent. Such a non-investment entity subsidiary would be consolidated in accordance with paragraph 32 of IFRS 10.</p></body></paragraph>
