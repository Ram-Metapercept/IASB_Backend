The Board does not think it is appropriate to consider whether there will be &#x2018;more or less consolidation&#x2019; by applying the new proposals. However, the clarifications in relation to less than a majority of the voting rights will lead to more consolidation. In the case of what SIC&#x2011;12 referred to as special purpose entities, the Board believes that the new requirements will result in more appropriate consolidation.</p></body></paragraph>
