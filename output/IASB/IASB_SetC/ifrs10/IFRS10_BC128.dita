However, some respondents believed that the exposure draft was not clear on whether the Board intended the proposed application guidance to be limited to legal or contractual agency relationships. Most respondents agreed that the form of remuneration can be an indicator of an agency relationship. However, many found the application guidance, in this respect, confusing. They did not agree with the dual role guidance that required an investor to assess in aggregate its rights as an agent and a principal. Nor did they believe that such an investor should automatically exclude its rights as an agent from the control assessment.</p></body></paragraph>
