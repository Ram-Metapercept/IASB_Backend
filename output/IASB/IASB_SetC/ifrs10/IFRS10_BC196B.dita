Allowing investors to use existing information in such cases reduces the risk of using hindsight and may provide a more reliable basis for consolidation. Consequently, if control was obtained before the effective date of IFRS 3 (2008), the Board decided to allow entities to use either IFRS 3 (2008) or IFRS 3 (2004) in applying the transition requirements.</p></body></paragraph>
