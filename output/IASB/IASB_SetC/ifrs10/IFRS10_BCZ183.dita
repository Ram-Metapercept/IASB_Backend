Accordingly, the general requirements in IFRSs should be applied in accounting for the derecognition from the group&#x2019;s financial statements of the subsidiary&#x2019;s assets and liabilities. If a gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income would be reclassified to profit or loss on the separate disposal of those assets and liabilities, the parent reclassifies the gain or loss from equity to profit or loss on the indirect disposal of those assets and liabilities through loss of control of a subsidiary.</p></body></paragraph>
