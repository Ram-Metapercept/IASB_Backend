If that is the case, the investor would not consolidate the investee. However, the assessment should be reconsidered as additional evidence becomes available. For example, the voting rights held by an investor and others may be unchanged but over time the investor may have been able to appoint a majority of the investee&#x2019;s board of directors and may have entered into significant transactions with the investee, thereby enabling the overall assessment to be made that the investor now has control and should consolidate the investee. </p></body></paragraph>
