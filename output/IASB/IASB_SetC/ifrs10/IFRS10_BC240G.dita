Consequently, when an investment entity parent assesses whether a subsidiary should be measured at fair value in accordance with paragraph 31 of IFRS 10 or, instead, should be consolidated in accordance with paragraph 32 of IFRS 10, the parent assesses whether the subsidiary meets the definition of an investment entity. If so, the investment entity parent measures its investment entity subsidiary at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with paragraph 31.</p></body></paragraph>
