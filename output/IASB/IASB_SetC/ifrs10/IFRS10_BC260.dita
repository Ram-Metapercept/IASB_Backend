However, the Board thinks that having more than one investor would make it less likely that the entity, or other members of the group that contains the entity, would obtain benefits other than capital appreciation or investment income from its investment. Consequently, the Board decided to include the presence of more than one investor as a typical characteristic of an investment entity rather than as part of the definition of an investment entity.</p></body></paragraph>
