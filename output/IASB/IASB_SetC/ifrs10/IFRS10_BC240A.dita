This amended paragraphs 32, BC85C and B85E of IFRS 10 to clarify which subsidiaries of an investment entity should be consolidated instead of being measured at fair value. The amendments were made in response to a request for the Board to clarify how to apply paragraph 32 when the subsidiary of an investment entity itself meets the definition of an investment entity and provides services that relate to the parent&#x2019;s investment activities.</p></body></paragraph>
