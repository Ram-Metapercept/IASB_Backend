For example, five parties each own 20 per cent of entity Z, and each has one seat on entity Z&#x2019;s board of directors. All strategic operating and financing decisions (ie decisions in respect of the activities that significantly affect the returns of entity Z) require the consent of any four of the five directors. The five parties do not jointly control entity Z because unanimous consent is not required for decisions relating to the activities of entity Z that significantly affect its returns. Nevertheless, it is clear that the power to direct the activities of entity Z is shared and no single party controls entity Z. Again, the Board confirmed that the requirements of IFRS 10 do not change or amend the application of IFRSs to such situations.</p></body></paragraph>
