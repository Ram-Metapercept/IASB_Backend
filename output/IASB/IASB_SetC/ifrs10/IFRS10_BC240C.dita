They suggested that an investment entity parent should be able to apply a &#x2018;dual-model&#x2019; of consolidation, which would allow an investment entity parent to show its directly and indirectly held investments at fair value while consolidating other activities. This is similar to the asset-based approach previously rejected by the Board (see paragraph BC226).</p></body></paragraph>
