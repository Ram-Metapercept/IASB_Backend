In particular, respondents from the insurance industry requested an exception to consolidating their interests in insurance investment funds. They argued that presenting the fair value of their interests in insurance investment funds as a single line item, along with a single line item for the current value of their liability to policyholders who receive the returns from those investment funds, would provide more useful information to users than consolidation. The Board noted that providing an exception to consolidation for insurers&#x2019; interests in insurance investment funds is outside the scope of the Investment Entities project, which was meant to provide an exception to consolidation for investment entities. In addition, any additional exceptions to consolidation would require the Board to do further work to define the entities that could apply those exceptions. The Board noted that this additional exception to consolidation was not contemplated in the scope of the project nor was it exposed for comment. Consequently, the Board decided not to extend the proposed exception to consolidation.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
