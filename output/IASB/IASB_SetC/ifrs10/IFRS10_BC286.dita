Consequently, the Board decided that when an investment entity has not yet adopted IFRS 13, it may use the fair value amounts previously reported to investors or to management, as long as those amounts represent the amount for which the investment could have been exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm&#x2019;s length transaction at the date of the valuation. The Board noted that if previously used fair value measurements are not available, it may be impracticable to measure fair value without using hindsight. In such cases, transition relief is available.</p></body></paragraph>
