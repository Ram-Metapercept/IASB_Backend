However, respondents provided examples of entities with related investors that they believed should qualify as investment entities. For example, a separate &#x2018;parallel&#x2019; entity may be formed to allow the employees of an investment entity to invest in a fund that mirrors the investments in the main fund. The Board agreed with the respondents&#x2019; arguments and decided that an investment entity would not be required to have investors that are unrelated to the investment entity or to other members of the group that contains the investment entity.</p></body></paragraph>
