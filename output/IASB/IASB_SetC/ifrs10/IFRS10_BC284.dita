Some respondents disagreed with the proposal, arguing that retrospective application would result in more useful information. In addition, they noted that retrospective application should not be onerous because investment entities would be expected to have information about the fair value of their investments. Those respondents also argued that retrospective application would be consistent with the other transition requirements in IFRS 10.</p></body></paragraph>
