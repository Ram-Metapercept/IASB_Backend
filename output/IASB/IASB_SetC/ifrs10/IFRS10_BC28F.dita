Paragraph 6 of IFRS 12 previously stated that IFRS 12 did not apply to an entity&#x2019;s separate financial statements without stating the applicability of IFRS 12 to investment entities. The Board decided to clarify that this scope exclusion does not apply to the financial statements of a parent that is an investment entity and has measured all of its subsidiaries at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with paragraph 31 of IFRS 10. In such cases, the investment entity shall present the disclosures relating to investment entities required by IFRS 12.</p></body></paragraph>
