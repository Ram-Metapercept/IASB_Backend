The exposure to risks and rewards, or variable returns as it is expressed in IFRS 10, is an essential element of control. In the great majority of cases the approaches would lead to the same accounting conclusions. However, a control&#x2011;based model forces an investor to consider all its rights in relation to the investee rather than relying on arbitrary bright lines that are associated with risks and rewards approaches, such as paragraph 10(c) and (d) of SIC&#x2011;12, which referred to control if the investor has rights to obtain the majority of the benefits of the investee or if the investor retains the majority of the risks related to the investee. The Board believes that an investor will, generally, want to control an investee when it has significant economic exposure. This should reduce the likelihood of structuring simply to achieve a particular accounting outcome.</p></body></paragraph>
