The FASB tentatively decided that it would propose changes to the consolidation requirements relating to both variable interest entities and voting interest entities in the context of assessing whether a decision maker is a principal or an agent. Those proposals would be similar to the requirements developed jointly by the IASB and the FASB regarding the principal/agent assessment, which are included in IFRS 10.</p></body></paragraph>
