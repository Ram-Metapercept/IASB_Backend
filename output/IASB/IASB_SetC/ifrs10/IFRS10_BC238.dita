An investment entity collects funds from investors and invests those funds to obtain returns solely from capital appreciation, investment income, or both. Consequently, the Board decided that the definition of an investment entity should state that an investment entity commits to its investor(s) that its business purpose is to provide investment management services and invest funds solely for returns from capital appreciation, investment income, or both.</p></body></paragraph>
