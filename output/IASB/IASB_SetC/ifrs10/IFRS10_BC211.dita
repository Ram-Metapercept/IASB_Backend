These costs should decrease if the requirements in the revised IFRS are clearer. Accordingly, because IFRS 10 addresses the concerns conveyed to the Board about the absence of guidance in IAS 27 and SIC&#x2011;12, the Board concluded that preparers will benefit from the new requirements. The Board accepts that any new IFRS will cause preparers to incur one&#x2011;&#x2011;off costs associated with learning the new requirements and reassessing their accounting. However, the Board&#x2019;s assessment is that the benefits from providing clearer principles and more application guidance outweigh those costs.</p></body></paragraph>
