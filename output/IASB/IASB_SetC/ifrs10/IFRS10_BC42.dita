IAS 27 defines control as the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity. The Board decided to change the definition of control because even though power is often obtained by governing the strategic operating and financing policies of an investee, that is only one of the ways in which power to direct the activities of an investee can be achieved. An investor can have the power to direct the activities of an investee through decision&#x2011;making rights that relate to particular activities of an investee. Indeed, referring to the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee would not necessarily apply to investees that are not directed through voting or similar rights.</p></body></paragraph>
