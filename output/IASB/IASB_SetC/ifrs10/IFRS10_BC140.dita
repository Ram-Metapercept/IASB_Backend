The Board observed that removal rights are defined as &#x2018;rights to deprive the decision maker of its decision&#x2011;making authority&#x2019; and that some other rights (such as some liquidation rights) may have the same effect on the decision&#x2011;making authority as removal rights. If those other rights meet the definition of removal rights, they should be treated as such regardless of their label. Therefore, the Board concluded that there was no need to add further guidance in this respect in the IFRS.</p></body></paragraph>
