For an investee that is directed through voting or similar rights, it is generally the case that a range of operating and financing activities are those that significantly affect the investee&#x2019;s returns&#x2014;for example, selling goods or services, purchasing inventory, making capital expenditures or obtaining finance. In that case, an investor that is able to determine the strategic operating and financing policies of the investee would usually have power.</p></body></paragraph>
