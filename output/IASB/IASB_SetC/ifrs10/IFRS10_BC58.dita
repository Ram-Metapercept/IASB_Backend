For an investee that is not directed through voting or similar rights it can be difficult to determine which investor, if any, meets the power element of the control definition. There is also a risk that, without adding the modifier &#x2018;significant&#x2019;, an investor with very little ability to affect the returns could be considered to have power over that investee (for example, if the investor has the ability to direct the most significant of a number of insignificant activities that have little effect on the investee&#x2019;s returns).</p></body></paragraph>
