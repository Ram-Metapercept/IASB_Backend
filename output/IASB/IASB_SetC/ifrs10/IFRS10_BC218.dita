Often, an investment entity holds non-controlling interests in some entities that are reported at fair value, as well as controlling interests in other entities that are consolidated in accordance with current principles in IFRSs. Reporting investments on more than one basis hinders comparability within the financial statements, because all investments are held by an investment entity for a similar purpose&#x2014;returns from capital appreciation, investment income, or both. In addition, some of the items consolidated may be measured at historical cost, which distorts the performance assessment of the investment entity and does not reflect the way in which the business of the entity is managed.</p></body></paragraph>
