In their view, such an approach would perpetuate problems faced in applying the guidance in IAS 27 and SIC&#x2011;12&#x2014;two control models leading to inconsistent application and, therefore, potential arbitrage by varying investee&#x2011;specific characteristics. Respondents also noted that the guidance provided for structured entities should apply generally to all investees. Therefore, they suggested that there should be a single section that combines guidance on assessing control of all investees.</p></body></paragraph>
