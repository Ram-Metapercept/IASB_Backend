This is because the &#x2018;ability&#x2019; model would be applied consistently to all investees by considering the rights held by the investor, as well as the rights held by other parties, when assessing control. For example, in the context of voting rights, an investor would assess whether its voting and any other contractual rights would be sufficient to give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities, or whether the voting and other rights held by other shareholders could prevent it from directing the relevant activities if those shareholders chose to act. The model would be applied in a similar way when other parties hold potential voting rights, kick&#x2011;out rights or similar rights.</p></body></paragraph>
