They would measure that gain or loss as the difference between the consideration received and the proportion of the carrying amount of the subsidiary&#x2019;s assets (including recognised goodwill) attributable to the ownership interest being disposed of. Respondents supporting this alternative said that it would provide relevant information about the gains and losses attributable to the controlling interest arising on the partial disposal of ownership interests in subsidiaries.</p></body></paragraph>
