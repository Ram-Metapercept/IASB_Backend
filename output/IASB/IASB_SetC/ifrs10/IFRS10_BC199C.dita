Without changing the requirement to apply the recognition and measurement requirements of IFRS 10 retrospectively, the Board decided to limit the requirement to present adjusted comparatives to the annual period immediately preceding the date of initial application. This is consistent with the minimum comparative disclosure requirements contained in <xref base="F18664697" href="../ias01/IAS01_TOC.dita#IAS01_TOC0001" id="IFRS10_X1166"><ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 1</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Presentation of Financial Statements</ph></ph></xref> as amended by <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2009&#x2013;2011 Cycle</ph></ph> (issued May 2012). Those amendments confirmed that when an entity applies a changed accounting policy retrospectively, it shall present, as a minimum, three statements of financial position (ie 1 January 2012, 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2013 for a calendar-year entity, assuming no early application of this IFRS) and two of each of the other statements (<xref base="F18664698" href="../ias01/IAS01_40B.dita#IAS01_40B" id="IFRS10_X1167">IAS 1 paragraphs 40A&#x2013;40B</xref>). Notwithstanding this requirement, the Board confirmed that an entity is not prohibited from presenting adjusted comparative information for earlier periods. The Board noted that if all comparative periods are not adjusted then entities should be required to state that fact, clearly identify the information that has not been adjusted, and explain the basis on which it has been prepared.</p></body></paragraph>
