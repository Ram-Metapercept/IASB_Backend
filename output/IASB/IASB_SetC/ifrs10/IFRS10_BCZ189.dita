They said that the need for guidance on when multiple arrangements should be accounted for as a single arrangement indicates a conceptual weakness in the accounting model developed in the exposure draft. Moreover, such guidance would be unnecessary under other alternatives for accounting for decreases in ownership interests. The Board acknowledges that guidance on multiple arrangements would be unnecessary under some other accounting alternatives. However, the Board does not accept that this means that those models are conceptually superior.</p></body></paragraph>
