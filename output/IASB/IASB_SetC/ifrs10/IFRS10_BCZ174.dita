By acquiring the non&#x2011;controlling interests the parent is obtaining the rights to some, or all, of the income to which the non&#x2011;controlling interests previously had rights. Generally, the wealth&#x2011;generating ability of those assets is unaffected by the acquisition of the non&#x2011;controlling interests. That is to say, the parent is not investing in more or new assets. It is acquiring more rights to the income from the assets it already controls.</p></body></paragraph>
