An investor may conclude that the nature of its relationship with other parties is such that those other parties are acting on the investor&#x2019;s behalf (they are &#x2018;de facto agents&#x2019;). Such a relationship need not involve a contractual arrangement, thereby creating a non&#x2011;contractual agency relationship. The Board concluded that a party is a de facto agent when the investor has, or those that direct the activities of the investor have, the ability to direct that party to act on the investor&#x2019;s behalf.</p></body></paragraph>
