The fair value of the investment at the date of the change of status should be used as the consideration received when applying the guidance in IFRS 10. The Board considered how to account for the gain or loss on the &#x2018;deemed disposal&#x2019; and decided to recognise it as a gain or loss in profit or loss. This treats the change in the business purpose of the investor as a significant economic event and is consistent with the rationale for gains and losses being recognised in profit or loss in IFRS 10 when control is lost.</p></body></paragraph>
