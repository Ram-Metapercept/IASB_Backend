In reaching this decision, the Board noted that it would be inappropriate to assume that all other parties listed in paragraph B75 would <i>always</i> or <i>never</i> act for the investor. It acknowledged that the assessment of whether the nature of the relationship between the investor and the other party is such that the other party is a de facto agent requires judgement, including consideration of the nature of the relationship and the way that the parties interact with each other.</p></body></paragraph>
