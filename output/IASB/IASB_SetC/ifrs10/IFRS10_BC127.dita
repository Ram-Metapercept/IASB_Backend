The exposure draft proposed that when assessing whether an investor acts as an agent or a principal, the investor would exclude the voting rights that it holds as an agent only if it could demonstrate that it is obliged to act in the best interests of other parties or has implemented policies and procedures that ensure the independence of the decision maker in its role as an agent from that as a holder of voting rights directly.</p></body></paragraph>
