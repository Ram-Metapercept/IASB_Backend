The Board decided that these typical characteristics could be used to help an entity decide if it meets the definition of an investment entity. The absence of any of these typical characteristics may indicate that an entity does not meet the definition of an investment entity. However, an entity that does not display all of these typical characteristics could, nevertheless, meet the definition of an investment entity.</p></body></paragraph>
