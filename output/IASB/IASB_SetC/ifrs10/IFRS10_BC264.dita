Respondents provided examples of entities that do not have units of ownership in the form of equity or similar interests but provide investors with a proportionate share of their net assets. For example, a pension fund or sovereign wealth fund with a single direct investor may have beneficiaries that are entitled to the net assets of the investment fund, but do not have ownership units. In addition, respondents noted that funds with different share classes or funds in which investors have discretion to invest in individual assets would be disqualified from investment entity status because they did not provide each investor with a proportionate share of net assets.</p></body></paragraph>
