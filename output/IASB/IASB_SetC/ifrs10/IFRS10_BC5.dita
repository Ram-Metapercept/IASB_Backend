Respondents to ED 10 pointed out that the Board and the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), in their Memorandum of Understanding, had agreed to work towards developing common standards on consolidation by 2011. Therefore, they asked the boards to discuss the consolidation project jointly to ensure that the ensuing standards contained identical, not only similar, requirements. As a result, the Board&#x2019;s deliberations in developing IFRS 10 were conducted jointly with the FASB from October 2009.</p></body></paragraph>
