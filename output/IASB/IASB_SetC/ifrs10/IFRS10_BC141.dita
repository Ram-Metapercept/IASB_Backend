However, the Board rejected developing a model that would specify a particular level of returns that would result in the determination of an agency relationship. Rather, the Board concluded that the more a decision maker is exposed to the variability of returns from its involvement with an investee, the more likely it is that the decision maker is a principal.</p></body></paragraph>
