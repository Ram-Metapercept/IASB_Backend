Respondents stressed that early application was especially important for first&#x2011;time adopters in 2011 and 2012. The Board was persuaded by these arguments and decided to permit early application of IFRS 10 but only if an entity applies it in conjunction with the other IFRSs (ie <xref base="F16221294" href="../ifrs11/IFRS11_TOC.dita#IFRS11_TOC0001" id="IFRS10_X1141">IFRS 11</xref>, <xref base="F16221295" href="../ifrs12/IFRS12_TOC.dita#IFRS12_TOC0001" id="IFRS10_X1142">IFRS 12</xref>, <xref base="F16221296" href="../ias27/IAS27_TOC0001.dita#IAS27_TOC0001" id="IFRS10_X1143">IAS 27 (as amended in 2011)</xref> and <xref base="F16221297" href="../ias28/IAS28_TOC.dita#IAS28_TOC0001" id="IFRS10_X1144">IAS 28 (as amended in 2011)</xref>) to avoid a lack of comparability among financial statements, and for the reasons noted in <xref base="F16221298" href="IFRS10_gBC191-BCZ203.dita#IFRS10_gBC191-BCZ203/IFRS10_gBC191-BCZ203_TI" id="IFRS10_X1145">paragraph BC191</xref> that triggered the Board&#x2019;s decision to set the same effective date for all five IFRSs. Even though an entity should apply the five IFRSs at the same time, the Board noted that an entity should not be prevented from applying any of the disclosure requirements of IFRS 12 early if by doing so users gained a better understanding of the entity&#x2019;s relationships with other entities.</p></body></paragraph>
