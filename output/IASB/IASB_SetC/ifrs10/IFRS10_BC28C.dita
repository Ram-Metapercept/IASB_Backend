The Board had previously decided that the conditions in paragraph 4(a) provide safeguards for the users of the intermediate parent&#x2019;s financial statements. In addition, the Board noted that the combination of information available in the consolidated financial statements of the higher level parent and the separate financial statements of the intermediate parent entity provide useful information to users.</p></body></paragraph>
