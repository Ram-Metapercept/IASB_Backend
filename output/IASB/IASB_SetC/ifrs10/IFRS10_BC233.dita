However, the Board noted that the remaining criteria represent typical characteristics of an investment entity and decided to include these typical characteristics in the investment entities guidance to help entities determine whether they qualify as an investment entity. If an entity does not display one or more of the typical characteristics, it indicates that additional judgement is required in determining whether the entity meets the definition of an investment entity. Consequently, the Board also decided that an investment entity that does not have one or more of the typical characteristics would be required to disclose how it still meets the definition of an investment entity.            </p></body></paragraph>
