The expectation is that one investor will have that ability to direct the activities that <i>most</i> significantly affect the investee&#x2019;s returns and consequently would be deemed to have power.  In effect, power is attributed to the party that looks most like the party that controls the investee. However, the Board decided not to prescribe a specific mechanism for assessing which activities of an investee <i>most</i> significantly affect the investee&#x2019;s returns.</p></body></paragraph>
