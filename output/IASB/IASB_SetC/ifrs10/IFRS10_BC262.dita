Again, having unrelated investors is one way to help ensure that the entity, or another member of the group that contains the entity, does not receive returns from investments that are other than capital appreciation or investment income. Having investors that are unrelated to the entity or its parent (if any), is therefore described as a typical characteristic of an investment entity in this IFRS.</p></body></paragraph>
