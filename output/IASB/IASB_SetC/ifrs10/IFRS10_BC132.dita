Similarly, if the decision maker held a substantial investment in the investee (say, a 95 per cent investment), most would conclude that the decision maker uses any decision&#x2011;making authority delegated to it primarily to affect the returns it receives&#x2014;the decision maker would have power for its own benefit. But at what point, between insignificant and very significant, does the decision maker change from using any decision&#x2011;making authority primarily for others to using its authority primarily for itself?</p></body></paragraph>
