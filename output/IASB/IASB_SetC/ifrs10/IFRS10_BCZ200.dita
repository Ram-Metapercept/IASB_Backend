Therefore, the Board proposed in its 2005 exposure draft to require retrospective application of the amendments to IAS 27, on the basis that the benefits of retrospective application outweigh the costs. However, in that exposure draft the Board identified two circumstances in which it concluded that retrospective application would be impracticable:</p><ol id="IFRS10_L0094" base="F16129246" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS10_P1148" base="F16129247">accounting for increases in a parent&#x2019;s ownership interest in a subsidiary that occurred before the effective date of the amendments. Therefore, the accounting for any previous increase in a parent&#x2019;s ownership interest in a subsidiary before the effective date of the amendments should not be adjusted.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS10_P1149" base="F16129249">accounting for a parent&#x2019;s investment in a former subsidiary for which control was lost before the effective date of the amendments. Therefore, the carrying amount of any investment in a former subsidiary should not be adjusted to its fair value on the date when control was lost. In addition, an entity should not recalculate any gain or loss on loss of control of a subsidiary if the loss of control occurred before the effective date of the amendments.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
