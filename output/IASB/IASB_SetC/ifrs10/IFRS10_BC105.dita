Those requirements often determine or influence the rights held by shareholders and consequently have an influence on the ability of an investor to have power over an investee with less than half the voting rights. For that reason, the Board concluded that drawing a line at 50 per cent in terms of voting power could lead to inappropriate consolidation conclusions in some jurisdictions.</p></body></paragraph>
