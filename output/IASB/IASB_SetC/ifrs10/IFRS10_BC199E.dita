It was noted that some respondents to the exposure draft had commented that, particularly when an investee is disposed of or control is lost during the comparative period, the cost of providing temporary consolidation information is not justified. The Board noted that this raised broader issues with the application of <xref base="F18664737" href="../ifrs01/IFRS01_TOC.dita#IFRS01_TOC0001" id="IFRS10_X1176">IFRS 1</xref> and, rather than address this issue in the context of clarifying IFRS 10 transition relief, it would be more appropriately addressed in the context of <xref base="F18664738" href="../ifrs01/IFRS01_TOC.dita#IFRS01_TOC0001" id="IFRS10_X1177">IFRS 1</xref> itself.</p></body></paragraph>
