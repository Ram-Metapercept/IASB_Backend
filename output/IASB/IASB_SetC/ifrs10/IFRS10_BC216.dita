In 2002, the respondents to the Exposure Draft of IAS 27 asked the Board to provide an exception to consolidation for the subsidiaries of venture capital organisations, private equity entities and similar organisations. At that time, the Board decided not to introduce such an exception because it did not think that it should differentiate between the types of entity, or the types of investment, when applying a control model of consolidation. It also did not agree that management&#x2019;s reasons for holding an investment should determine whether or not that investment is consolidated. The Board concluded that for investments under the control of venture capital organisations, private equity entities and similar organisations, users&#x2019; information needs are best served by financial statements in which those investments are consolidated, thus revealing the extent of the operations of the entities they control.</p></body></paragraph>
