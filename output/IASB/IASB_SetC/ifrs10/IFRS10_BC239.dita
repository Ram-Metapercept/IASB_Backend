While some respondents agreed with this, others argued that an investment entity should be allowed to provide such services to third parties. They argued that the provision of these investment-related services to third parties is simply an extension of the investment entity&#x2019;s investing activities and should not prohibit an entity from qualifying as an investment entity. The Board agreed with these arguments, concluding that the provision of such services is within the business model of an investment entity. Although such an entity may earn fee income from the provision of investment-related services, its sole business purpose is still investing for capital appreciation, investment income, or both (whether that is for itself, for its investors or for external parties).</p></body></paragraph>
