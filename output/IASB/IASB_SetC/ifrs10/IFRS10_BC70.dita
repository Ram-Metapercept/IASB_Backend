Other parties can have protective rights relating to the activities of an investee. For example, limits on power are often imposed by law or regulations. Similarly, other parties&#x2014;such as non&#x2011;controlling interests&#x2014;may hold protective rights that limit the power of the investor. During its redeliberations the Board confirmed that an investor can control an investee even if other entities have protective rights relating to the activities of the investee. <xref id="IFRS10_X1036" base="F16220901" href="IFRS10_gBC93-BC124.dita#IFRS10_gBC93-BC124/IFRS10_gBC93-BC124_TI">Paragraphs BC93&#x2013;BC124</xref> discuss rights that give an investor power over an investee.</p></body></paragraph>
