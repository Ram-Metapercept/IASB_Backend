That is, the investment entity would use the fair value of the investment at the date of the change of status as the &#x2018;deemed&#x2019; consideration transferred to obtain control of the investee. This recognises the change in status in the same way as a business combination achieved in stages, as described in IFRS 3. This would result in the recognition of goodwill or a gain on a bargain purchase.</p></body></paragraph>
