If an investor on initial application of IFRS 10 consolidates an investee it previously did not consolidate and it is impracticable to apply the provisions of IFRS 10 retrospectively, the reporting entity would apply the acquisition method in IFRS 3 with the acquisition date being the beginning of the earliest period for which application of those requirements is practicable (goodwill would not be recognised for an investee that is not a business).</p></body></paragraph>
