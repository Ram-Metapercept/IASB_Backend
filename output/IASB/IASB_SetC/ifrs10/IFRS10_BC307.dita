Users also commented that consolidated financial statements of an investment entity may hinder users&#x2019; ability to assess an investment entity&#x2019;s financial position and results, because it emphasises the financial position, operations and cash flows of the investee, rather than those of the investment entity.</p></body></paragraph>
