Although that assessment requires judgement, the Board believes that an investor should be able to apply the judgement required. This is because potential voting rights exist for a reason&#x2014;the terms and conditions of the instruments reflect that reason. Therefore, an assessment of the terms and conditions of the instrument (ie the purpose and design of the instrument) should provide information about whether the instrument was designed to give the holder power before exercise or conversion.</p></body></paragraph>
