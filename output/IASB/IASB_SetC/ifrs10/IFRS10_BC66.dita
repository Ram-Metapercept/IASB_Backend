During its deliberations, the Board concluded that such instruments create variability of returns for the other entity but do not typically expose the reporting entity to variability of returns from the performance of the other entity. For example, assume an entity (entity A) is established to provide investment opportunities for investors who wish to have exposure to entity Z&#x2019;s credit risk (entity Z is unrelated to any other party involved in the arrangement). Entity A obtains funding by issuing to those investors notes that are linked to entity Z&#x2019;s credit risk (credit&#x2011;linked notes) and uses the proceeds to invest in a portfolio of risk&#x2011;free financial assets. Entity A obtains exposure to entity Z&#x2019;s credit risk by entering into a credit default swap (CDS) with a swap counterparty. The CDS passes entity Z&#x2019;s credit risk to entity A, in return for a fee paid by the swap counterparty. The investors in entity A receive a higher return that reflects both entity A&#x2019;s return from its asset portfolio and the CDS fee. The swap counterparty does not have involvement with entity A that exposes it to variability of returns from the performance of entity A because the CDS transfers variability to entity A, rather than absorbing variability of returns of entity A.</p></body></paragraph>
