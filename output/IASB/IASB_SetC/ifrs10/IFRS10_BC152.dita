In response to those concerns, the IASB decided to add guidance to address the reassessment of control (including a decision maker&#x2019;s status as principal or agent) when there are changes in market conditions (for the reassessment of control in the context of potential voting rights see <xref id="IFRS10_X1094" base="F16221136" href="IFRS10_BC124.dita#IFRS10_BC124">paragraph BC124</xref>). The Board observed that a change in market conditions alone would not generally affect the consolidation conclusion, or the status as a principal or an agent, for two reasons. The first is that power arises from substantive rights , and assessing whether those rights are substantive includes the consideration of many factors, not only those that are affected by a change in market conditions. The second is that an investor is not required to have a particular specified level of exposure to variable returns in order to control an investee. If that were the case, fluctuations in an investor&#x2019;s expected returns might result in changes in the consolidation conclusion.</p></body></paragraph>
