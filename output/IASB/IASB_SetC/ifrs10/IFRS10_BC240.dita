The Board did not think that the existence of such a subsidiary should prohibit an entity from qualifying as an investment entity, even if those services were substantial or were provided to third parties in addition to the entity. The Board views such services as an extension of the operations of the investment entity and therefore concluded that subsidiaries that provide those services should be consolidated.</p></body></paragraph>
