However, US GAAP has industry-specific guidance for a number of industries, and the application of that industry-specific guidance by a subsidiary is retained by a parent entity, regardless of whether the parent entity is part of that industry. IFRSs generally do not contain such industry&#x2011;specific guidance.</p></body></paragraph>
