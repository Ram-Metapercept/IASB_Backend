However, the Board understands that an investment entity may engage in these activities in order to maximise the overall value of the investee (ie to maximise capital appreciation), rather than to obtain other benefits. Consequently, the Board believes that these activities can be consistent with the overall activities of an investment entity and should not be prohibited as long as they do not represent a separate substantial business activity or source of income other than capital appreciation.</p></body></paragraph>
