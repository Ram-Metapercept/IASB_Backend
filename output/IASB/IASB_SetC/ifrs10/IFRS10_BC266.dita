As an alternative, the Board considered requiring that an investment entity&#x2019;s ownership interests be in the form of equity or similar interests. However, the Board was concerned that this would put too much emphasis on the debt/equity classification in <xref base="F36790166" href="IFRS10_TOC.dita#IFRS10_TOC0001" id="IFRS10_X1248">IAS 32 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Financial Instruments: Presentation</ph></ph></xref> and would inappropriately exclude some structures whose ownership interests were classified as debt. Moreover, the Board was also concerned that including the &#x2018;ownership interest&#x2019; concept as part of the definition of an investment entity would put too much emphasis on the form of the entity, rather than emphasising its business model.</p></body></paragraph>
