The Board concluded that such an investor&#x2019;s voting rights are sufficient to give it power over the investee regardless of whether it has exercised its voting power, unless those rights are not substantive or there are separate arrangements providing another entity with power over the investee (such as through a contractual arrangement over decision&#x2011;making or substantive potential voting rights).</p></body></paragraph>
