Some respondents disagreed with that decision. They asserted that the principles for revenue and gain recognition in the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph> would not be satisfied for the retained interest. The Board disagreed with those respondents. Measuring the investment at fair value reflected the Board&#x2019;s view that the loss of control of a subsidiary is a significant economic event. The parent&#x2011;subsidiary relationship ceases to exist and an investor&#x2011;investee relationship begins that differs significantly from the former parent&#x2011;subsidiary relationship. Therefore, the new investor&#x2011;investee relationship is recognised and measured initially at the date when control is lost.</p></body></paragraph>
