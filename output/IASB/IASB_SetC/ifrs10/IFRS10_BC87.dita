If those different activities, in fact, significantly affect the returns of the investee, some would reason that it would be artificial to force the parties involved to conclude that one activity is more important than the others. An investor might be required to consolidate an investee when the investor would not have the power to direct <i>all</i> the activities of the investee that significantly affect the investee&#x2019;s returns.</p></body></paragraph>
