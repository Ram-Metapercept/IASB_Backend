In particular, the Board prohibited the use of the exception to consolidation by non-investment entity parents of investment entities, in order to address respondents&#x2019; concerns about structuring and to restrict the use of the exception to situations where fair value information would be more relevant than information arising from the consolidation of subsidiaries.</p></body></paragraph>
