The Board did not think it would be appropriate to conclude that every party that is obliged, by law or contract, to act in the best interests of other parties is an agent for the purposes of assessing control. This conclusion, in effect, assumes that a decision maker that is legally or contractually obliged to act in the best interests of other parties will always do so, even if that decision maker receives the vast majority of the returns that are influenced by its decision&#x2011;making. Although this assumption might be appropriate for some decision makers, the Board observed that it would not be appropriate for all, in particular many investees that are not directed through voting or similar rights. Almost every investment or asset manager could contend that it is contractually obliged to act in the best interests of others. This conclusion could result in virtually every investee that is not directed through voting or similar rights being unconsolidated.</p></body></paragraph>
