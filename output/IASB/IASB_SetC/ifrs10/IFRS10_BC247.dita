The Board does not think it is appropriate for an entity to qualify for an exception to consolidation if that entity is holding equity investments indefinitely and is not planning to realise capital appreciation from those investments. Although the exit strategy may vary depending on circumstances, potential exit strategies that include a substantive time frame for exiting from the investment should still be identified and documented for equity and non&#x2011;financial investments in order to meet the definition of an investment entity.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
