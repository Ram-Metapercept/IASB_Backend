This will be the case if those rights are substantive and on exercise or conversion (when considered together with any other existing rights the holder has) they give the holder the current ability to direct the relevant activities. The holder of such potential voting rights has the contractual right to &#x2018;step in&#x2019;, obtain voting rights and subsequently exercise its voting power to direct the relevant activities&#x2014;thus the holder has the current ability to direct the activities of an investee at the time that decisions need to be taken if those rights are substantive.</p></body></paragraph>
