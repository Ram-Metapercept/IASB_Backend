The Board amended the transition guidance to confirm that an entity is not required to make adjustments to the previous accounting for its involvement with entities if the consolidation conclusion reached at the date of initial application is the same whether applying IAS 27/SIC&#x2011;12 or IFRS 10. In making this clarification, the Board confirmed that the transition relief in <xref base="F18664668" href="IFRS10_C3.dita#IFRS10_C3" id="IFRS10_X1162">paragraph C3(b)</xref> would also apply to interests in investees that were disposed of before the date of initial application of IFRS 10, (ie 1 January 2013 for a calendar-year entity, assuming no early application).</p></body></paragraph>
