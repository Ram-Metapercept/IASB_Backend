For example, the parent is not necessarily responsible for the liabilities of a subsidiary, and often there are factors that restrict the ability of a parent to move assets in a group, which means that the assets of the group are not necessarily freely available to the parent. The Board decided that it would be more appropriate to address comprehensively disclosures about non&#x2011;controlling interests (disclosures about non&#x2011;controlling interests are included in <xref base="F16221181" href="../ifrs12/IFRS12_TOC.dita#IFRS12_TOC0001" id="IFRS10_X1109">IFRS 12</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
