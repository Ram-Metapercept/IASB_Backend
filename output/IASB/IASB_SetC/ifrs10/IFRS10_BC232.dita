The Board believes that there are structures in practice in which an entity does not meet one or more of the criteria that were described in the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Investment Entities</ph></ph> ED, but should still qualify as an investment entity. For example, the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Investment Entities</ph></ph> ED required an investment entity to have more than one investor; the Board thinks that some pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and other investment funds with a single investor should qualify as investment entities. Moreover, respondents commented that the application guidance in the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Investment Entities</ph></ph> ED provided too many exceptions to the strict criteria.</p></body></paragraph>
