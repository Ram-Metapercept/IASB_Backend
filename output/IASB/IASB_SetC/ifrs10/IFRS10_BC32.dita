The more an investor is exposed to risks and rewards from its involvement with an investee, the greater the incentive for the investor to obtain decision&#x2011;making rights that give it power. However, risks and rewards and power are not necessarily perfectly correlated. Therefore, the Board confirmed that exposure to risks and rewards (referred to in IFRS 10 as variable returns) is an <i>indicator of control</i> and an important factor to consider when assessing control, but an investor&#x2019;s exposure to risks and rewards alone does not determine that the investor has control over an investee. </p></body></paragraph>
