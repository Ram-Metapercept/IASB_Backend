For example, would an entity be motivated to structure a transaction or arrangement as multiple steps to maximise gains or minimise losses if an entity were planning to dispose of its controlling interest in a subsidiary? Consider the following example. Entity P controls 70 per cent of entity S. Entity P intends to sell all of its 70 per cent controlling interest in entity S. Entity P could initially sell 19 per cent of its ownership interest in entity S without loss of control and then, soon afterwards, sell the remaining 51 per cent and lose control. Alternatively, entity P could sell all of its 70 per cent interest in entity S in one transaction. In the first case, any difference between the amount by which the non&#x2011;controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration received on the sale of the 19 per cent interest would be recognised directly in equity, whereas the gain or loss from the sale of the remaining 51 per cent interest would be recognised in profit or loss. In the second case, a gain or loss on the sale of the whole 70 per cent interest would be recognised in profit or loss.</p></body></paragraph>
