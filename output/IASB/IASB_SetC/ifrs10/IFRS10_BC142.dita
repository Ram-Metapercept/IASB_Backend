It would create a bright line that might encourage structuring to achieve a particular accounting outcome. The Board also noted that when assessing agency relationships, a decision maker&#x2019;s exposure to variability of returns is not necessarily correlated with the amount of power that it has, unlike the general assumption when investees are controlled by voting rights. Therefore, a decision maker does not necessarily have any more power over an investee when it is exposed, for example, to more than half of the variability of an investee&#x2019;s returns than when it is not.</p></body></paragraph>
