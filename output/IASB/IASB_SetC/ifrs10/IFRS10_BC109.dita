However, in other cases these factors may not be sufficient to enable a determination to be made and additional evidence would need to be considered for an investor to determine whether it has power.  IFRS 10 sets out additional factors to be considered in these circumstances.  In particular, the Board noted that the fewer voting rights an investor holds and the fewer parties that would need to act together to outvote the investor, the more reliance would need to be placed on additional evidence to determine whether the investor has power. </p></body></paragraph>
