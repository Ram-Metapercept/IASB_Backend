The IASB observed that the function of such governing bodies is to act as a fiduciary for the investors and therefore any rights given to an investee&#x2019;s board of directors (or other governing body) is a pass&#x2011;through mechanism for the exercise of the investors&#x2019; rights. Thus, the governing body itself cannot be considered to have or restrict decision&#x2011;making authority over the investee. Rather it is the rights given to such a governing body by the investors and their effect on the decision&#x2011;making authority that should be considered. Consequently, a governing body is not generally viewed as a single party.</p></body></paragraph>
