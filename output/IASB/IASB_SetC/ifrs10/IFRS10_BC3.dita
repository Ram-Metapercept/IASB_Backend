SIC&#x2011;12, which interpreted the requirements of IAS 27 in the context of special purpose entities,<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS10_FN0021" type="fn"/> placed greater emphasis on risks and rewards. This perceived conflict of emphasis had led to inconsistent application of the concept of control. This was aggravated by a lack of clear guidance on which investees were within the scope of IAS 27 and which were within the scope of SIC&#x2011;12. As a result, assessing control sometimes resulted in a quantitative assessment of whether the investor had a majority of the risks. Such tests based on sharp &#x2018;bright line&#x2019; distinctions created structuring opportunities to achieve particular accounting outcomes.</p></body></paragraph>
