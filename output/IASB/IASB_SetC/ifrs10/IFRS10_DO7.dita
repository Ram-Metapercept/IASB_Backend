However, paragraph BC207 of the Basis for Conclusions on IFRS 3 (as revised in 2008) states that accounting for the non&#x2011;controlling interests at fair value is conceptually superior to this alternative measurement. This view implies that the subsidiary&#x2019;s portion of goodwill attributable to the non&#x2011;controlling interests at the date when control was obtained is an asset at that date and there is no conceptual reason for it no longer to be an asset at the time of any subsequent acquisitions of non&#x2011;controlling interests.</p></body></paragraph>
