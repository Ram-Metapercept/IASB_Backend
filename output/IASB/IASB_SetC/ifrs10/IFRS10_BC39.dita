For that reason, the Board concluded that when assessing control, reputational risk is a factor to consider along with other facts and circumstances. It is not an indicator of power in its own right, but may increase an investor&#x2019;s incentive to secure rights that give the investor power over an investee.</p></body></paragraph>
