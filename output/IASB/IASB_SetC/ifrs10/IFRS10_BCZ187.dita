In accordance with <xref base="F16221253" href="../ifrs05/IFRS05_g20-25.dita#IFRS05_g20-25/IFRS05_g20-25_TI" id="IFRS10_X1123">paragraph 20 of IFRS 5</xref> &#x2018;an entity shall recognise an impairment loss for any initial or subsequent write&#x2011;down of the asset (or disposal group) to fair value less costs to sell&#x2026;&#x2019;. Therefore, if appropriate, an impairment loss would be recognised for the goodwill and non&#x2011;current assets of a subsidiary that will be sold or otherwise disposed of before control of the subsidiary is lost. Accordingly, the Board concluded that the principal risk is the minimising of gains, which entities are unlikely to strive to do.</p></body></paragraph>
