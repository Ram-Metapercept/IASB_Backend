Those revisions apply prospectively. The requirements of IAS 27 (revised in 2008) have been carried forward into IFRS 10. For the same reasons as those described in BC196A&#x2013;BC196B relating to IFRS 3, if control was obtained before the effective date of IAS 27 (2008), the Board also decided to allow entities to use either IAS 27 (2008) or IAS 27 (2003) in applying the transition requirements.</p></body></paragraph>
