Many were confused, however, about what the Board meant by &#x2018;power to direct&#x2019; and which &#x2018;activities&#x2019; the Board had in mind. They asked for a clear articulation of the principle behind the term &#x2018;power to direct&#x2019;. They also expressed the view that power should relate to significant activities of an investee, and not those activities that have little effect on the investee&#x2019;s returns.</p></body></paragraph>
