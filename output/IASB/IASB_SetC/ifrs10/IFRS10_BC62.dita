This retains the concept that control conveys the rights to returns from an investee. To have control an investor must have power over the investee, exposure or rights to returns from its involvement with the investee and the ability to use its power to affect its own returns. Control is not a synonym of power, because equating power and control would result in incorrect conclusions in situations when an agent acts on behalf of others. ED 10 used the term &#x2018;returns&#x2019; rather than &#x2018;benefits&#x2019; because &#x2018;benefits&#x2019; are often interpreted as implying only positive returns.</p></body></paragraph>
