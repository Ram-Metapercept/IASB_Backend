Such information could reduce the cost of analysis by providing information more directly to users of financial statements. However, in many cases, investment entities already provide investors with fair value information, although this is often done in an alternative report rather than in the financial statements. This serves to emphasise that the main benefit of the changes is a reduction in costs to preparers because it eliminates what they see as a cumbersome reporting requirement that has little value.</p></body></paragraph>
