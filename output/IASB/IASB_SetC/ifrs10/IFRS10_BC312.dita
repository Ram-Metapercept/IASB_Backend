Consequently, the compliance cost savings described above will not be available to non-investment entity parents. Because these entities are not within the scope of these amendments, they may incur ongoing costs because they will have two different bases of accounting within the group. At the investment entity subsidiary level, subsidiaries held by the investment entity will be measured at fair value, but at the non-investment entity parent level, those subsidiaries will be consolidated.</p></body></paragraph>
