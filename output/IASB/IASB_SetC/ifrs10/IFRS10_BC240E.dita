It was not intended to capture subsidiaries that are themselves investment entities. The definition of an investment entity requires that the investment entity&#x2019;s business purpose and, therefore, its core activity is providing investment management services to its investors and investing the funds obtained from its investors solely for returns from capital appreciation, investment income, or both. When the Board decided that providing investment-related services to third parties would not prevent an entity from qualifying as an investment entity, it recognised that investment entities could benefit from synergies between the core investing activities and the provision of investment-related services to third parties.</p></body></paragraph>
