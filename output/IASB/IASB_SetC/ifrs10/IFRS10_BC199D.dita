On the initial application of an IFRS, <xref base="F18664729" href="../ias08/IAS08_28.dita#IAS08_28" id="IFRS10_X1172">paragraph 28(f) of IAS 8</xref> requires an entity to disclose, for the current period and for each prior period presented, the amount of any adjustment for each financial statement line item affected. Changes in the consolidation conclusion on transition to IFRS 10 are likely to affect many line items throughout the financial statements. The Board agreed that this requirement would be burdensome for preparers and so agreed to limit the disclosure of the quantitative impact of any changes in the consolidation conclusion to only the annual period immediately preceding the date of initial application. An entity may also present this information for the current period or for earlier comparative periods, but is not required to do so.</p></body></paragraph>
