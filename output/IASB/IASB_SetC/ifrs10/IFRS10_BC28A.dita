This question came about because an investment entity may measure all of its subsidiaries at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with paragraph 31 of IFRS 10. This decision was consistent with the proposal in the Exposure Draft <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception</ph></ph> (Proposed amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28), which was published in June 2014.</p></body></paragraph>
