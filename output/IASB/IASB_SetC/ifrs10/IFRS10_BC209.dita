IFRS 10 introduces a definition of control of an investee that is applied consistently when assessing whether an investor should consolidate an investee, irrespective of the nature of the investee. IFRS 10 also requires retrospective application of the requirements subject to the practicability exemptions in <xref base="F16221338" href="../ias08/IAS08_TOC.dita#IAS08_TOC0001" id="IFRS10_X1187">IAS 8</xref> that will result in comparable information for all periods presented.</p></body></paragraph>
