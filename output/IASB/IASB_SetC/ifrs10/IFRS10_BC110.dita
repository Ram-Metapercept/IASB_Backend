If an investor controls an investee, that conclusion is reached on the basis of evidence that is sufficient to conclude that the investor&#x2019;s rights give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities. The Board&#x2019;s intention was not to create a presumption that in the absence of evidence to the contrary the shareholder with the largest proportion of voting rights controls an investee.</p></body></paragraph>
