IAS 28 allows a parent that indirectly holds an investment in an associate through a venture capital organisation, mutual fund, unit trust or similar entity to measure that portion of the investment at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with <xref base="F68031692" href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_TOC.dita#IFRS09_TOC0001" id="IFRS10_X1261">IFRS 9</xref> or <xref base="F36793143" href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001/IAS39_TOC0001_V3" id="IFRS10_X1262">IAS 39</xref>.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS10_FN0046" type="fn"/> The Board acknowledged the inconsistency but thought it was important to keep the retention of fair value accounting that is currently allowed for venture capital organisations, mutual funds, unit trusts and similar entities. The Board also noted that the difference between using the equity method and fair value measurement for investments in associates and joint ventures is smaller than that between consolidation and fair value measurement for investments in subsidiaries.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
