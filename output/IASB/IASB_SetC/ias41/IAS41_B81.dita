The Board noted that requiring item (a) above would not be appropriate since external independent valuations are not commonly used for assets related to agricultural activity, unlike for certain other assets such as investment property. The Board also noted that item (b) is not required in other International Accounting Standards and a unique disclosure requirement is not warranted for agricultural activity. Items (c) and (d) would be outside the scope of the Standard and covered by other International Accounting Standards (<xref base="F15828949" href="../ias16/IAS16_TOC.dita#IAS16_TOC0001" id="IAS41_X0344">IAS 16</xref> or <xref base="F15828950" href="../ias02/IAS02_TOC0001.dita#IAS02_TOC0001" id="IAS41_X0345">IAS 2 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Inventories</ph></ph></xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
