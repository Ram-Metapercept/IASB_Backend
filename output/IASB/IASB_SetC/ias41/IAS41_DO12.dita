One of the weaknesses in IAS 41 is that it does not require the use of fair value to measure land to which bearer plants are attached. This is a weakness because the value of bearer plants is inextricably tied to the value of the land. By understanding the value of the bearer plants and the land, investors know the true potential of an entity&#x2019;s future net cash inflows. A historical cost model for either or both is incapable of providing such information.</p></body></paragraph>
