However, the Board noted that it is difficult to differentiate existing agricultural produce from agricultural produce that does not exist. For example: </p><ol id="IAS41_L0034" base="SL155387" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IAS41_P0840" base="SL155389">if an entity enters into a contract to sell fully&#x2011;grown wheat at a future date and has half&#x2011;grown wheat at a balance sheet date, it seems clear that the wheat to be delivered under the contract does not yet exist at the balance sheet date; but</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IAS41_P0841" base="SL155391">on the other hand, if an entity enters into a contract to sell mature cattle at a future date and has mature cattle at a balance sheet date, it could be argued that the cattle exist in the form in which they will be sold at the balance sheet date. However, it could also be argued that the cattle do not yet exist in the form in which they will be sold at the balance sheet date since further biological transformation will occur between the balance sheet date and the date of delivery.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
