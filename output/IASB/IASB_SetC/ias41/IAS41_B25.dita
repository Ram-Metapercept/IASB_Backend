They believe that the carrying amount of an asset should represent the economic benefits that are expected to flow from the asset. They argue that fair value less estimated point&#x2011;of&#x2011;sale costs would represent the markets&#x2019; estimate of the economic benefits that are expected to flow to the entity from that asset at the balance sheet date.
