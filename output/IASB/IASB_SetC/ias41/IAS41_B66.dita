Using the deduction from carrying value approach, an entity would first deduct the government grant from the carrying amount of the related asset and then measure that asset at its fair value. In effect, an entity would recognise a government grant as income immediately, even for a conditional government grant. This conflicts with the requirement in <xref id="IAS41_X0333" base="F15828864" href="../ias20/IAS20_TOC0001.dita#IAS20_TOC0001">IAS 20</xref> that government grants should not be recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the entity will comply with the conditions attaching to them.</p></body></paragraph>
