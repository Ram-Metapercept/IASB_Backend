More importantly, they believe fair value is sometimes not reliably measurable and that users of financial statements may be misled by presentation of numbers that are indicated as being fair value but are based on subjective and unverifiable assumptions. Information regarding fair value can be provided other than in a single number in the financial statements. They believe the scope of the Standard is too broad. They also argue that: </p> <ol id="IAS41_L0029" base="SL75179388" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IAS41_P0775" base="SL75179390">market prices are often volatile and cyclical and not appropriate as a basis of measurement;</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IAS41_P0776" base="SL75179392">it may be onerous to require fair valuation at each balance sheet date, especially if interim reports are required;</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IAS41_P0777" base="SL75179394">the historical cost convention is well established and commonly used.
