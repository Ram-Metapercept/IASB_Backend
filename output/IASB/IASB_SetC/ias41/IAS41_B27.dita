If an active market does not exist, an entity uses market&#x2011;determined prices       or values (such as the most recent market transaction price) when available. However, in some       circumstances, market&#x2011;determined prices or values may not be available for a biological       asset in its present condition. In these circumstances, the Standard indicates that an entity       uses the present value of expected net cash flows<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS41_FN0019" type="fn"/> from the asset. </p></body></paragraph>
