An entity may enter into a contract to sell agricultural produce to be harvested from the entity&#x2019;s biological assets. The Board concluded that it would not be appropriate to require fair value measurement for a contract to sell agricultural produce that does not yet exist (for example, milk to be harvested from a cow), since no related asset has yet been recognised or measured at fair value and to do so would be beyond the scope of the project on agriculture.</p></body></paragraph>
