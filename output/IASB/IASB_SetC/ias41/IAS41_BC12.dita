When measuring fair value, IFRS 13 neither prescribes the use of a single present value technique nor limits the use of present value techniques to only those discussed in that Standard. However, when using a present value technique, <xref href="../ifrs13/IFRS13_B14.dita">paragraph B14 of IFRS 13</xref> requires assumptions about cash flows and discount rates to be internally consistent. Depending on the particular facts and circumstances, an entity applying a present value technique might measure fair value by discounting after-tax cash flows using an after-tax discount rate or pre-tax cash flows at a rate consistent with those cash flows.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value><p>it would appear the Board&#x2019;s intention in amending IAS 41 in 2008 was to permit entities to include tax cash flows in measuring fair value (see <xref href="IAS41_BC6.dita">paragraph BC6</xref>). Removing &#x2018;taxation&#x2019; from paragraph 22 is consistent with that intent.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
