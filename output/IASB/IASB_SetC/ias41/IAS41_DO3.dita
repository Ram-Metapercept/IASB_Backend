Bearer plants are plants that are used only in the production or supply of agricultural produce and are expected to bear produce for more than one period. The June 2014 Amendment includes bearer plants within the scope of IAS 16. Consequently, entities would be permitted to choose either the cost model or the revaluation model for bearer plants. All other biological assets related to agricultural activity will remain under the fair value model in IAS 41, including bearer animals.</p></body></paragraph>
