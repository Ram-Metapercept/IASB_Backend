Some argued that IASC should begin a wider review of <xref id="IAS41_X0334" base="F15828865" href="../ias20/IAS20_TOC0001.dita#IAS20_TOC0001">IAS 20</xref> rather than provide special rules in individual International Accounting Standards. The Board acknowledged that this might be a more appropriate approach, but concluded that such a review would be beyond the scope of the project on agriculture. Instead, the Board decided to deal with government grants in the Standard, since the Board noted that government grants related to agricultural activity are common in some countries.</p></body></paragraph>
