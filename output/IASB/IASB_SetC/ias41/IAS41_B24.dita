They argue that fair value less estimated point&#x2011;of&#x2011;sale costs would be a biased estimate of markets&#x2019; estimate of future cash flows, because point&#x2011;of&#x2011;sale costs would in effect be recognised as an expense twice if the acquirer pays point&#x2011;of&#x2011;sale costs on acquisition; once related to the initial acquisition of biological assets and once related to the immediate measurement at fair value less estimated point&#x2011;of&#x2011;sale costs. This would occur even when point&#x2011;of&#x2011;sale costs would not be incurred until a future period or would not be paid at all for a bearer biological asset that will not be sold.</p></body></paragraph>
