At that time the Board did not amend <xref href="IAS41_22.dita">paragraph 22 of IAS 41</xref> to delete the reference to cash flows for taxation. Consequently, before <i>Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018&#x2013;2020</i>, IAS 41 had required an entity to use pre-tax cash flows when measuring fair value but did not require the use of a pre-tax discount rate to discount those cash flows.</p></body></paragraph>
