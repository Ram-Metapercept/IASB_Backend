Point&#x2011;of&#x2011;sale costs include commissions to brokers and dealers, levies by regulatory agencies and commodity exchanges, and transfer taxes and duties. Point&#x2011;of&#x2011;sale costs exclude transport and other costs necessary to get assets to a market. Such transport and other costs are deducted in determining fair value (that is, fair value is a market price less transport and other costs necessary to get an asset to a market).<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS41_FN0017" type="fn"/></p></body></paragraph>
