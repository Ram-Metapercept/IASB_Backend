Accordingly, to qualify under (a) or (b), the Standard requires changes in the recognised amount of inventories to be included in profit or loss for the period. The Board believes this is particularly appropriate in the case of commodity broker&#x2011;traders because they seek to profit from fluctuations in prices and trade margins.</p></body></paragraph>
