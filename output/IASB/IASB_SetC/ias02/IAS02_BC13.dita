However, LIFO can distort profit or loss, especially when &#x2018;preserved&#x2019; older &#x2018;layers&#x2019; of inventory are presumed to have been used when inventories are substantially reduced. It is more likely in these circumstances that relatively new inventories will have been used to meet the increased demands on inventory.</p></body></paragraph>
