For example, if the activity that triggers the payment of the levy occurs in 20X1 and the calculation of the levy is based on financial data for 20X0 (as in <xref id="IFRIC21_X0069" base="F24882259" href="IFRIC21_IE1.dita#IFRIC21_IE1/IFRIC21_TAB0002">Illustrative Example 2</xref>), some argue that a liability should be recognised in 20X0. Supporters of this argument point to the definition of a constructive obligation in <xref id="IFRIC21_X0070" base="F24882260" href="../ias37/IAS37_10.dita#IAS37_10">paragraph 10 of IAS 37</xref> and conclude that an entity might have no realistic alternative other than to continue to operate in the next period (ie 20X1). For example, they note that an entity may operate in a regulated market and may not be able to stop operating without a long period of run&#x2011;off.</p></body></paragraph>
