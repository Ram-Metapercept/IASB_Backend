If a levy is triggered as the entity undertakes an activity above a minimum level of activity (such as revenue or sales generated or outputs produced in excess of the minimum amount specified in the legislation), the obligating event is the activity that is undertaken after the threshold is reached (see <xref base="F25012901" href="../ias37/IAS37_IE_C_ex4.dita#IAS37_0012" id="IFRIC21_X0088">Illustrative Example 4</xref>). If a levy is triggered if an entity operates on a specified date, as identified by the legislation, provided that a minimum threshold is reached in a previous period (such as a minimum amount of revenue, a minimum number of employees, or a minimum amount of assets and liabilities), the obligating event is the entity operating on the specified date as identified by the legislation after having reached the threshold in the previous period. In that case, the reaching of the threshold in the previous period is necessary, but not sufficient, to create a present obligation. </p></body></paragraph>
