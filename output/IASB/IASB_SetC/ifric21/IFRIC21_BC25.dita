In accordance with <xref id="IFRIC21_X0083" base="F25012896" href="../ias37/IAS37_19.dita#IAS37_19">paragraph 19 of IAS 37</xref>, the Interpretations Committee noted that a present obligation exists only to the extent of the damage caused to date to the environment, because the entity has no present obligation to rectify the damage that will result from the extraction of oil in the future (ie the future conduct of its business).</p></body></paragraph>
