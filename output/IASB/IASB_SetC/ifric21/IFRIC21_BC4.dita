The Interpretations Committee noted that those levies do not meet the definition of income taxes provided in <xref base="F24882211" href="../ias12/IAS12_TOC0001.dita#IAS12_TOC0001" id="IFRIC21_X0046"><ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 12</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Income Taxes</ph></ph></xref> because they are not based on taxable profit. In two Agenda Decisions (published in March 2006 and May 2009), the Interpretations Committee (then called the IFRIC) noted that the term &#x2018;taxable profit&#x2019; implies a notion of a net rather than a gross amount. In those Agenda Decisions, the Interpretations Committee also observed that any taxes that are not within the scope of other Standards (such as <xref base="F24882212" href="../ias12/IAS12_TOC0001.dita#IAS12_TOC0001" id="IFRIC21_X0047">IAS 12</xref>) are within the scope of <xref base="F24882213" href="../ias37/IAS37_TOC.dita#IAS37_TOC0001" id="IFRIC21_X0048">IAS 37</xref>. The Interpretations Committee further observed that <xref base="F24882214" href="../ias37/IAS37_TOC.dita#IAS37_TOC0001" id="IFRIC21_X0049">IAS 37</xref> contains a definition of a liability and that a provision is defined in <xref base="F24882215" href="../ias37/IAS37_TOC.dita#IAS37_TOC0001" id="IFRIC21_X0050">IAS 37</xref> as a liability of uncertain timing or amount. The Interpretations Committee noted that the same recognition requirements should apply to provisions to pay a levy and to liabilities to pay a levy whose timing and amount is certain. Consequently, this Interpretation also addresses the accounting for a liability to pay a levy whose timing and amount is certain. </p></body></paragraph>
