In other words, the liability to pay a levy is recognised when the activity that triggers the payment of the levy occurs, as identified by the legislation. For example, if the activity that triggers the payment of the levy is the generation of revenue in 20X1 and the calculation of that levy is based on the revenue generated in 20X0, the obligating event for that levy is the generation of revenue in 20X1 (see <xref id="IFRIC21_X0066" base="F24882258" href="IFRIC21_IE1.dita#IFRIC21_IE1/IFRIC21_TAB0002">Illustrative Example 2</xref>). The date on which the levy is paid does not affect the timing of recognition of the liability to pay a levy, because the obligating event is the activity that triggers the payment of the levy (and not the payment of the levy itself). </p></body></paragraph>
