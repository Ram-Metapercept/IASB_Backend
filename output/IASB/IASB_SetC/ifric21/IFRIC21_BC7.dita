For the purposes of this Interpretation, levies are imposed by governments and therefore do not arise from contractual agreements. Similarly, the Interpretations Committee noted that this Interpretation does not apply to the accounting for trade discounts and volume rebates agreed between a seller and a purchaser under a contractual agreement. </p></body></paragraph>
