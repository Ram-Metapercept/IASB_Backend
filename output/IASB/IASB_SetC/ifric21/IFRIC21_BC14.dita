Those respondents think that the substance of a recurring levy is that it is an expense associated with a specific period (and not an expense triggered on a specific date). The Interpretations Committee concluded that this Interpretation is needed to address the diversity in practice and that it provides consistent information about an entity&#x2019;s obligations to pay levies. The Interpretations Committee also observed that this Interpretation does not address the accounting for the costs arising from recognising a liability to pay a levy and that other Standards would determine whether the recognition of the liability to pay a levy gives rise to an asset or an expense. Some respondents to the draft Interpretation asked the Interpretations Committee to consider the effect of economic compulsion to continue to operate in a future period and of going concern assumption on the accounting for levies. The Interpretations Committee&#x2019;s conclusions are set out below.</p></body></paragraph>
