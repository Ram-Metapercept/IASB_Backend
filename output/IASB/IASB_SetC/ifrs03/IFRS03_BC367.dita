Those costs are to be accounted for separately from the business combination, and generally recognised as expenses when incurred. The revised standards therefore resolve inconsistencies in accounting for acquisition&#x2011;related costs in accordance with the cost&#x2011;accumulation approach in IFRS 3 and SFAS 141, which provided that the cost of an acquiree included <i>direct</i> costs incurred for an acquisition of a business but excluded <i>indirect</i> costs. Direct costs included out&#x2011;of&#x2011;pocket or incremental costs, for example, finder&#x2019;s fees and fees paid to outside consultants for accounting, legal or valuation services for a successful acquisition, but direct costs incurred in unsuccessful negotiations were recognised as expenses as incurred. Indirect costs included recurring internal costs, such as maintaining an acquisition department. Although those costs also could be directly related to a successful acquisition, they were recognised as expenses as incurred.</p></body></paragraph>
