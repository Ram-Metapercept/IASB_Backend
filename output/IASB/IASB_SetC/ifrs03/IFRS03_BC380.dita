In other words, a buyer would be willing to pay a seller only an amount that is, according to that view, less than the fair value of the acquiree (or its identifiable net assets) because to make a fair return on the business the buyer would need to make further investments in that business to bring its condition to fair value. The boards disagreed with that view for the reasons noted in <xref base="F16382639" href="IFRS03_BC134.dita#IFRS03_BC134" id="IFRS03_X1509">paragraphs BC134&#x2013;BC143</xref> in the context of liabilities associated with restructuring or exit activities of the acquiree, as well as those that follow.</p></body></paragraph>
