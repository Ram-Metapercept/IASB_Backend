IFRS 3 did not provide for recognising those costs as liabilities because they do not represent liabilities of the acquiree at the acquisition date, although the expected future outflows may affect the value of existing recognised assets. The IASB concluded that it would be inconsistent to recognise &#x2018;unavoidable&#x2019; restructuring costs that arise in a business combination but to prohibit recognition of a liability for other &#x2018;unavoidable&#x2019; costs to be incurred as a result of the combination.</p></body></paragraph>
