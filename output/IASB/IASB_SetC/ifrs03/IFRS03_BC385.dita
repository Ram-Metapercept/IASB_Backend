The users of financial statements indicated they did not have significant concerns with that change to present practice, as long as the amount of the gain or loss is clearly disclosed in the financial statements or in the notes. <xref id="IFRS03_X1512" base="F16382642" href="IFRS03_B64.dita#IFRS03_B64">Paragraph B64(p)</xref> of the revised IFRS 3 requires that disclosure.</p></body></paragraph>
