That guidance was developed in phase I of the IASB&#x2019;s project on insurance contracts. The IASB decided not to amend those paragraphs in phase II of the business combinations project, so as not to pre&#x2011;empt phase II of the IASB&#x2019;s project on insurance contracts. In May 2007 the IASB published its initial thoughts for phase II of that project in a discussion paper <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Preliminary Views on Insurance Contracts</ph></ph>.</p></body></paragraph>
