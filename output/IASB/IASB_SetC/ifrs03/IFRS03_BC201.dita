In those circumstances, application of the cost accumulation and allocation process also resulted in identifiable assets and liabilities being assigned amounts that were generally not their acquisition&#x2011;date fair values. For example, in its 1993 Position Paper <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Financial Reporting in the 1990s and Beyond</ph></ph> the Association for Investment Management and Research (AIMR)<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS03_FN0048" type="fn"/> said:</p><lq> <p id="IFRS03_P2350" base="F4232294">An even more difficult situation arises when Firm B acquires less than total ownership of Firm A. Under current practice, only the proportionate share of Firm A&#x2019;s assets and liabilities owned by Firm B are re&#x2011;valued, but all of Firm A&#x2019;s assets and liabilities&#x2014;partially re&#x2011;valued, partially not&#x2014;are consolidated with those of Firm B, none of whose assets and liabilities have been re&#x2011;valued. What a m&#x00E9;lange! <b>The result is a combination of historic and current values that only a mystic could sort out with precision.</b> [page 28, emphasis added]</p></lq></body></paragraph>
