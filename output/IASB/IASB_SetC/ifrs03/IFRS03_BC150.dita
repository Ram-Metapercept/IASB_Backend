In addition, eliminating that requirement furthers the goal of international convergence of accounting standards. Therefore, SFAS 141(R) supersedes FASB Interpretation 4 and requires research and development assets acquired in a business combination to be recognised regardless of whether they have an alternative future use.</p></body></paragraph>
