From a conceptual standpoint, the excess tax goodwill meets the definition of a temporary difference. Not recognising the tax benefit of that temporary difference at the date of the business combination would be inappropriate and inconsistent with <xref id="IFRS03_X1420" base="F16122755" href="../ias12/IAS12_TOC0001.dita#IAS12_TOC0001">IAS 12</xref> and SFAS 109; it would also be inconsistent with the recognition principle in the revised standards. Thus, the revised IFRS 3 clarifies IAS 12 and SFAS 141(R) amends SFAS 109 accordingly.</p></body></paragraph>
