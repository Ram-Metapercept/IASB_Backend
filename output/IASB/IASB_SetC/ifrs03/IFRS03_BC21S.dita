The Board also amended the definition of a business to make it consistent with the narrowed definition of outputs. The Board made these changes because:</p><ol type="lower-alpha"><li id="IFRS03_BC21S_a"><li_value>(a)</li_value>         <p><xref href="../ifrs14/IFRS15_TOC.dita" scope="local"><ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 15</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Revenue from Contracts with Customers</ph></ph></xref> focuses on goods or services that are an output of an entity&#x2019;s ordinary activities. Nevertheless, because not all businesses have revenue within the scope of IFRS 15, the revised definition also includes outputs that are investment income or other income from ordinary activities.</p>       </li><li id="IFRS03_BC21S_b"><li_value>(b)</li_value>         <p>the previous definition of outputs referred to lower costs and economic benefits provided directly to investors. This reference did not help to distinguish between an asset and a business, because it confused motives for acquiring an asset with the characteristics of the activities and assets acquired. Many asset acquisitions (for example, the purchase of new manufacturing equipment) may be made with the motive of lowering costs but may not involve acquiring a substantive process.</p>       </li></ol></body></paragraph>
