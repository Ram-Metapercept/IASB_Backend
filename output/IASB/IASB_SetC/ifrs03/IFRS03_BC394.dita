Neither of those provisions was identical to the measurement period guidance in the revised standards, although IFRS 3&#x2019;s was quite similar. However, the measurement period provisions in the revised standards differ in important ways from the allocation period guidance of SFAS 141 and its cost&#x2011;allocation method. The revised standards emphasise the principle that assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non&#x2011;controlling interest in the acquiree should be measured at their acquisition&#x2011;date fair values. SFAS 141&#x2019;s allocation period and its post&#x2011;combination adjustments delayed the recognition of assets and liabilities, and those assets and liabilities were not measured at their acquisition&#x2011;date fair values when they were recognised. Therefore, the FASB decided to replace the SFAS 141 term <i>allocation period</i> and its guidance with the measurement period guidance in the revised standards.</p></body></paragraph>
