In addition, the IASB made consequential amendments to <xref id="IFRS03_X1305" base="F16122342" href="../ias38/IAS38_25.dita#IAS38_25">paragraphs 25</xref> <xref id="IFRS03_X1306" base="F16122343" href="../ias38/IAS38_33.dita#IAS38_33">and 33 of IAS 38 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Intangible Assets</ph></ph></xref> to clarify the reason for its conclusion that the probability recognition criterion is always considered to be satisfied for intangible assets that are acquired separately or in a business combination. Specifically, the amendment indicates that an entity expects there to be an inflow of economic benefits embodied in an intangible asset acquired separately or in a business combination, even if there is uncertainty about the timing and the amount of the inflow.</p></body></paragraph>
