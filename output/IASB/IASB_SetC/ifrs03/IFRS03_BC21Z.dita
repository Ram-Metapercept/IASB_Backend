That outcome would be a false positive. The Board designed the       concentration test to minimise the risk that a false positive could deprive users       of financial statements of useful information. A false positive has two       consequences:</p><ol type="lower-alpha"><li id="IFRS03_BC21Z_a"><li_value>(a)</li_value><p>the entity fails to recognise &#x2018;core           goodwill&#x2019; that is economically present in a business combination but is not present in an           asset acquisition.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS03_BC21Z_FN0001" type="fn"/> Nevertheless, if substantially all of the fair value of the gross           assets acquired (including core goodwill) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset           (or a group of similar identifiable assets), the fair value of the core goodwill cannot be           a substantial part of the total fair value of the gross assets acquired. Thus, information           about the value of that core goodwill is unlikely to be material. Moreover, if the fair           value of the processes acquired is not significant, the detailed assessment required by             <xref href="IFRS03_gB8-B11.dita">paragraphs B8&#x2013;B12D</xref> would be unlikely           to conclude that the processes are substantive.</p></li><li id="IFRS03_BC21Z_b"><li_value>(b)</li_value><p>there are some other differences between the accounting required for a         business combination and the accounting required for an asset         acquisition, including differences relating to deferred tax, contingent         consideration, acquisition-related costs, and gains on bargain purchases.         Those differences in accounting requirements are not driven by         differences between the economics of a business combination and the         economics of an asset acquisition. Therefore, the Board did not expect a         false positive to result in a loss of information about the economics of a         business combination.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
