The FASB rejected that suggestion because it concluded that the asset&#x2019;s <b>capability</b> of being separated from the entity and exchanged for something else of value is the pertinent characteristic of an intangible asset that distinguishes it from goodwill. In contrast, management&#x2019;s intentions are not a characteristic of an asset.</p></body></paragraph>
