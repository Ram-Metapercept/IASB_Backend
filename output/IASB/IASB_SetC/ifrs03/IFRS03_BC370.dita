Some constituents, including some respondents to the 2005 Exposure Draft, said that if acquirers could no longer capitalise acquisition&#x2011;related costs as part of the cost of the business acquired, they might modify transactions to avoid recognising those costs as expenses. For example, some said that a buyer might ask a seller to make payments to the buyer&#x2019;s vendors on its behalf. To facilitate the negotiations and sale of the business, the seller might agree to make those payments if the total amount to be paid to it upon closing of the business combination is sufficient to reimburse the seller for payments it made on the buyer&#x2019;s behalf. If the disguised reimbursements were treated as part of the consideration transferred for the business, the acquirer might not recognise those expenses. Rather, the measure of the fair value of the business and the amount of goodwill recognised for that business might be overstated. To mitigate such concerns, the revised standards require any payments to an acquiree (or its former owners) in connection with a business combination that are payments for goods or services that are not part of the acquired business to be assigned to those goods or services and accounted for as a separate transaction. The revised standards specifically require an acquirer to determine whether any portion of the amounts transferred by the acquirer are separate from the consideration exchanged for the acquiree and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the business combination. The revised standards (see <xref id="IFRS03_X1503" base="F16382530" href="IFRS03_g51-53.dita#IFRS03_g51-53">paragraphs 51&#x2013;53</xref> and <xref id="IFRS03_X1504" base="F16382532" href="IFRS03_B50.dita#IFRS03_B50">B50</xref> of the revised IFRS 3) provide guidance for making that determination.</p></body></paragraph>
