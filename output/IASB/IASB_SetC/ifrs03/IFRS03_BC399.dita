The effects of events that occur after the end of an accounting period but before the financial statements for the period are authorised for issue and provide evidence of a condition that existed at the date of the financial statements are reflected in financial statements as of that date. Similarly, the effects of information that first becomes available during the measurement period and provides evidence of conditions or circumstances that existed at the acquisition date should be reflected in the accounting as of that date.</p></body></paragraph>
