Goodwill also lacks the capacity singly to produce future net cash inflows, although it can&#x2014;in combination with other assets&#x2014;produce cash flows. Thus, the future benefit associated with goodwill is generally more nebulous and may be less certain than the benefit associated with most other assets. Nevertheless, goodwill generally provides future economic benefit. The FASB&#x2019;s Concepts Statement 6 observes that &#x2018;Anything that is commonly bought and sold has future economic benefit, including the individual items that a buyer obtains and is willing to pay for in a &#x201C;basket purchase&#x201D; of several items or in a business combination&#x2019; (paragraph 173).</p></body></paragraph>
