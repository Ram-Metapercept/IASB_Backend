The rebuttable presumption could have been overcome if the subsequent recognition of the tax benefits resulted from a discrete event or circumstance occurring after the acquisition date. Recognition of acquired tax benefits after the one&#x2011;year period would be accounted for in profit or loss (or, if <xref id="IFRS03_X1418" base="F16122754" href="../ias12/IAS12_TOC0001.dita#IAS12_TOC0001">IAS 12</xref> or SFAS 109 so requires, outside profit or loss). Respondents suggested particular modifications to that proposal, including removing the rebuttable presumption about subsequent recognition of acquired tax benefits within one year of the acquisition date and treating increases and decreases in deferred tax assets consistently. (IAS 12 and SFAS 109 provided guidance on accounting for decreases.) The boards agreed with those suggestions and revised the requirements of the revised standards accordingly.</p></body></paragraph>
