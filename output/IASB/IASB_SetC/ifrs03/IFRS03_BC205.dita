Thus, because goodwill is measured as a residual, the amount recognised for a non&#x2011;controlling interest in an acquiree would also have been a residual. Also, an important issue in deciding how to measure a non&#x2011;controlling interest was whether its share of goodwill should be recognised (often referred to as the &#x2018;full goodwill versus partial goodwill issue&#x2019;). In developing the 2005 Exposure Draft, the boards concluded that it should be recognised (in other words, they selected the &#x2018;full goodwill&#x2019; alternative).</p></body></paragraph>
