The FASB provided such criteria in SFAS 141 and the IASB provided similar, although not identical, criteria in <xref id="IFRS03_X1325" base="F16122419" href="../ias38/IAS38_TOC0001.dita#IAS38_TOC0001">IAS 38</xref>.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS03_FN0042" type="fn"/> One reason for providing such criteria was the boards&#x2019; conclusion that the decision&#x2011;usefulness of financial statements would be enhanced if intangible assets acquired in a business combination were distinguished from goodwill. For example, the FASB&#x2019;s Concepts Statement No. 5 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Recognition and Measurement in Financial Statements of Business Enterprises</ph></ph> says that classification in financial statements facilitates analysis by grouping items with essentially similar characteristics and separating items with essentially different characteristics. Analysis aimed at objectives such as predicting amounts, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows requires financial information segregated into reasonably homogeneous groups.</p></body></paragraph>
