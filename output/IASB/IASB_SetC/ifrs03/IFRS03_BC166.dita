Some respondents suggested that the FASB should eliminate that requirement, arguing that unless the asset is separable individually it should be included in the amount recognised as goodwill. Others asked the FASB to clarify the meaning of the term <i>group of related assets</i>, noting that even goodwill can be separated from the acquiree if the asset group sold constitutes a business.</p></body></paragraph>
