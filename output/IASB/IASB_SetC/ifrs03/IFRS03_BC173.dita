The effects of uncertainty because of a range of possible outcomes with different probabilities are reflected in measuring the asset&#x2019;s fair value; the existence of such a range does not demonstrate an inability to measure fair value reliably. IAS 38 (before amendment by the revised IFRS 3) included a rebuttable presumption that the fair value of an intangible asset with a finite useful life acquired in a business combination can be measured reliably. The IASB had concluded that it might not always be possible to measure reliably the fair value of an asset that has an underlying contractual or legal basis. However, <xref id="IFRS03_X1332" base="F16122454" href="../ias38/IAS38_TOC0001.dita#IAS38_TOC0001">IAS 38</xref> provided that the only circumstances in which it might not be possible to measure reliably the fair value of an intangible asset that arises from legal or other contractual rights acquired in a business combination were if it either:</p><ol id="IFRS03_L0104" base="F4232235" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS03_P2316" base="F4232236">is not separable; or</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS03_P2317" base="F4232238">is separable, but there is no history or evidence of exchange transactions for the same or similar assets, and otherwise estimating fair value would depend on immeasurable variables.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
