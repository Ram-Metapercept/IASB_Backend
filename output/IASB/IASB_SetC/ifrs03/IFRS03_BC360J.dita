The IASB thinks that it is appropriate for the disclosure requirements of IFRS 7 to apply to contingent consideration that is a financial instrument within the scope of IFRS 7. Consequently, the IASB decided not to make any changes to the scope of IFRS 7 to exclude such financial instruments. </p></body></paragraph>
