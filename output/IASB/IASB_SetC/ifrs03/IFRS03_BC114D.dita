At the same time, the IASB made two other amendments to       clarify aspects of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS           3</ph></ph> that it concluded would not be affected by replacing the reference to the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph>:</p><ol type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>         <p id="P0002">the IASB added paragraph 23A to <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 3</ph></ph> to clarify the requirements for           contingent assets&#x2014;that is, possible assets whose existence is uncertain. <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 3</ph></ph> prohibits           the recognition of contingent assets acquired in a business combination. This prohibition           can be inferred from the recognition principle and is confirmed in paragraph BC276 of this           Basis for Conclusions. However, the prohibition was not stated explicitly in <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 3</ph></ph> itself,           and questions arose as to how it would be affected by replacing the reference to the           <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph>. The IASB concluded it would be unaffected&#x2014;the 2018 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual             Framework</ph></ph> specifies criteria for recognising assets and liabilities, and           paragraph 5.14 says that these criteria might not be met if it is uncertain whether an           asset exists. The IASB added paragraph 23A to <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 3</ph></ph> to make its requirements for           contingent assets explicit and clarify that replacing the reference to the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph> does           not change them.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>         <p id="P0003">the IASB deleted paragraph BC125 from this Basis for Conclusions. In applying any           IFRS Standard, an entity should apply only the recognition criteria specified in that           Standard. However, paragraph BC125 referred to the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph> in a way that could be read           to mean that, in applying <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 3</ph></ph>, an acquirer of a business should apply both the           recognition criteria specified in <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 3</ph></ph> and other recognition criteria discussed in the           <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph>. The IASB deleted paragraph BC125 because of its potential to cause           misunderstanding. The IASB does not usually amend the basis for its previous conclusions,           but decided that, in this instance, the importance of reducing the risk of           misunderstanding warranted the deletion.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
