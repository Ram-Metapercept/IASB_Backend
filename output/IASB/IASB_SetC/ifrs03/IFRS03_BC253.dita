That practice was established in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 2.A.5 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Adjustments to Allowances for Loan Losses in Connection with Business Combinations</ph></ph> which states that generally the acquirer&#x2019;s estimation of the uncollectible portion of the acquiree&#x2019;s loans should not change from the acquiree&#x2019;s estimation before the acquisition. However, the FASB also observed that fair value measurement is consistent with guidance in AICPA Statement of Position 03&#x2011;3 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer</ph></ph> (AICPA SOP 03&#x2011;3), which prohibits &#x2018;carrying over&#x2019; or creating valuation allowances in the initial accounting of all loans acquired in transfers that are within its scope, including business combinations accounted for as an acquisition.</p></body></paragraph>
