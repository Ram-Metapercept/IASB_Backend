However, both boards have expressed interest in considering whether joint venture formations and some formations of new entities in multi&#x2011;party business combinations should be accounted for by the fresh start method. Depending on the relative priorities of that topic and other topics competing for their agendas when time becomes available, the boards might undertake a joint project to consider those issues at some future date.</p></body></paragraph>
