Some aspects of combinations of not&#x2011;for&#x2011;profit organisations are different from combinations of business entities. For example, it cannot be presumed that combinations of organisations that serve a public interest are necessarily exchange transactions in which willing parties exchange equal values. For that reason, the FASB is addressing the accounting for combinations of not&#x2011;for&#x2011;profit organisations in a separate project. It published an exposure draft in October 2006 that addresses accounting for combinations of not&#x2011;for&#x2011;profit organisations.</p></body></paragraph>
