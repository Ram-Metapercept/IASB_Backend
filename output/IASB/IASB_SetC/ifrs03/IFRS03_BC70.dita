Respondents objected to the use of the acquisition method for conceptual, practical and cost&#x2011;benefit reasons. For example, some said that a combination involving only mutual entities is a &#x2018;true pooling of interests&#x2019; and that the acquisition method would not reflect the economics of the transactions. Some also said that it would often be difficult to identify an acquirer. Some also noted the absence of readily measurable consideration transferred in many combinations of mutual entities, which would make it necessary to use other valuation techniques to develop the fair values needed to apply the acquisition method. For those reasons, respondents also said that using the acquisition method for combinations of mutual entities would not be cost&#x2011;beneficial. Respondents proposed other methods of accounting for mutual entities, including the pooling method, the fresh start method and a net asset method that was the same as the modified version of the acquisition method proposed by the IASB in its exposure draft mentioned in <xref id="IFRS03_X1273" base="F16122222" href="IFRS03_BC64.dita#IFRS03_BC64">paragraph BC64</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
