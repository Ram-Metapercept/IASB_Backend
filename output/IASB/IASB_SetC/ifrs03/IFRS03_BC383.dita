The guidance on combinations achieved without the transfer of consideration merely responds to a question about how to report the acquiree&#x2019;s net assets in the equity section of the acquirer&#x2019;s post&#x2011;combination statement of financial position, and this Basis for Conclusions does not discuss that guidance further.</p></body></paragraph>
