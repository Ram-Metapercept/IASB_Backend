Non&#x2011;performance risk includes but may not be limited to the reporting entity&#x2019;s own credit risk. In comparison, IFRSs do not use the term <i>non&#x2011;performance risk</i> in discussing the fair value of a liability. However, <xref base="F16122629" href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001" id="IFRS03_X1383">IAS 39</xref> requires the fair value of a financial liability to reflect its credit risk. Although the words are different, the boards believe that the underlying concepts are essentially the same.</p></body></paragraph>
