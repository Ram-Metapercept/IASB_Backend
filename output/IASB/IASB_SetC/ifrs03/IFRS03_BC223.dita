That requirement is generally consistent with the measurement requirements of IFRS 3, but it represents a change in the way entities generally applied SFAS 141. In addition, the IASB&#x2019;s measurement guidance on contingent liabilities carries forward the related guidance in IFRS 3, pending completion of the project to revise IAS 37 (<xref id="IFRS03_X1367" base="F16122589" href="IFRS03_BC272.dita#IFRS03_BC272">paragraphs BC272&#x2013;BC276</xref>). Accordingly, the FASB&#x2019;s and the IASB&#x2019;s conclusions on measuring assets and liabilities arising from contingencies are discussed separately.</p></body></paragraph>
