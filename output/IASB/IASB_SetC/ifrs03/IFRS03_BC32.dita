The former owners of each entity no longer have an exclusive interest in the net assets of the pre&#x2011;combination entities. Rather, after the business combination, the owners of the combining entities have a residual interest in the net assets of the combined entity. The information provided by the pooling method fails to reflect that and is therefore not a faithful representation.</p></body></paragraph>
