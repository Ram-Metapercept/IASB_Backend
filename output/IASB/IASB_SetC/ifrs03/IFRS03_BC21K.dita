In some cases, the acquirer integrates an acquired business with the result that it no longer generates revenue. For example, an       entity may acquire a supplier and subsequently consume all the output from the       supplier. The acquired inputs and processes are still &#x2018;capable of&#x2019; generating       revenue at the acquisition date and so could qualify as a business, if the criteria       in <xref href="ifrs03/IFRS03_B12C.dita">paragraph B12C</xref> are met. The Board concluded that this outcome was       appropriate because the assessment focuses on what the acquirer acquired, not       on what the acquirer intends to do with what it acquired. Accordingly, the       Board retained the term &#x2018;capable of&#x2019; as the basis for assessment.</p></body></paragraph>
