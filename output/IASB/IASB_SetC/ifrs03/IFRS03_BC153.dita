However, the boards observed that use of estimates and judgement, by itself, does not mean that information is unreliable; reliability does not require precision or certainty. For example, paragraph 86 of the IASB&#x2019;s <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph> says that &#x2018;In many cases, cost or value must be estimated; the use of reasonable estimates is an essential part of the preparation of financial statements and does not undermine their reliability.&#x2019; The boards also noted that the requirement to measure the fair value of in&#x2011;process research and development assets acquired in a business combination is not new&#x2014;not even in US GAAP. In accordance with FASB Interpretation 4, that amount was measured but immediately written off. Moreover, respondents to the 2005 Exposure Draft that apply IFRSs generally did not mention any problems with complying with the provisions of IFRS 3 on research and development assets, which are the same as those in the revised standards.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
