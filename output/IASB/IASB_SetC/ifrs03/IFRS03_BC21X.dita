This change enables entities to assess whether they have acquired a       substantive process when, for example, such an assessment would be more       efficient than applying the concentration test, or would result in a conclusion       that more faithfully represents the economics of a particular transaction. In line       with the purpose of the concentration test, the 2018 Amendments:</p><ol type="lower-alpha"><li id="IFRS03_BC21X_a"><li_value>(a)</li_value><p outputclass="keep_with_next">specify that the election to carry out that test is available transaction by         transaction; and</p></li><li id="IFRS03_BC21X_b"><li_value>(b)</li_value><p>do not prohibit an entity from carrying out the detailed assessment         required by <xref href="IFRS03_gB8-B11.dita">paragraphs B8&#x2013;B12D</xref> if the entity has carried out the         concentration test and concluded that the acquired set of activities and         assets is not a business. The Board decided that such a prohibition was         unnecessary, because if an entity intended to disregard the outcome of         the concentration test, it could have elected not to apply it.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
