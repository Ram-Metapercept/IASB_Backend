Many participants in the PIR       indicated that this phrase was too broad in scope to be helpful in distinguishing       businesses from assets. However, the Board concluded that it was not necessary       to change or clarify this phrase because the 2018 Amendments:</p><ol type="lower-alpha"><li id="IFRS03_BC21J_a"><li_value>(a)</li_value><p>removed the assessment of whether market participants are capable of         integrating the acquired activities and assets;</p></li><li id="IFRS03_BC21J_b"><li_value>(b)</li_value><p>clarified that the acquired processes need to be substantive;</p></li><li id="IFRS03_BC21J_c"><li_value>(c)</li_value><p>narrowed the definition of output; and</p></li><li id="IFRS03_BC21J_d"><li_value>(d)</li_value><p>added more robust guidance and illustrative examples supporting         various aspects of the definition.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
