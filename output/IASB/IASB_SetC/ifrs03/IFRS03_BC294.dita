Therefore, SFAS 141(R) amends FASB Interpretation No. 48 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes</ph></ph> (FASB Interpretation 48) to require a change to an acquired income tax uncertainty within the measurement period that results from new information about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date to be recognised through a corresponding adjustment to goodwill. If that reduces goodwill to zero, an acquirer would recognise any additional increases of the recognised income tax uncertainty as a reduction of income tax expense. All other changes in the acquired income tax uncertainties would be accounted for in accordance with FASB Interpretation 48.</p></body></paragraph>
