To target that aim, the concentration test       focuses on a single identifiable asset or a single group of similar identifiable       assets. The Board did not expect entities to carry out detailed calculations to       apply the test, because detailed calculations would have frustrated the purpose       of the test, which is to permit a simplified assessment. In addition, the Board       wanted the test to have the same outcome in most circumstances as the detailed       assessment and wanted to minimise the risk that the outcome of applying the       concentration test could deprive users of financial statements of useful       information.</p></body></paragraph>
