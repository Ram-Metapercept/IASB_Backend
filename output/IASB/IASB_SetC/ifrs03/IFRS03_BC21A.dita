Stakeholders indicated that these concerns arose for one or more of the following main reasons:</p><ol type="lower-alpha"><li id="IFRS03_BC21A_a"><li_value>(a)</li_value>         <p>IFRS 3 requires a fact-driven assessment that adopts the perspective of market participants and does not consider the business rationale, strategic considerations and objectives of the acquirer (see <xref href="IFRS03_BC21G.dita">paragraph BC21G</xref>);</p>       </li><li id="IFRS03_BC21A_b"><li_value>(b)</li_value>         <p>some sets of activities and assets might have been considered a business from the perspective of particular market participants who could integrate the set in their processes.
