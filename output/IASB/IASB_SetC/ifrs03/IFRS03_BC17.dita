Consistently with the suggestions of respondents to ED 3, the IASB decided to provide a definition of a business in IFRS 3. In developing that definition, the IASB also considered the guidance in EITF Issue 98&#x2011;3. However, the definition in IFRS 3 benefited from deliberations in this project to that date, and it differed from EITF Issue 98&#x2011;3 in some aspects. For example, the definition in IFRS 3 did not include either of the following factors, both of which were in EITF Issue 98&#x2011;3:</p><ol id="IFRS03_L0090" base="F4231614" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS03_P2097" base="F4231615">a requirement that a business be self&#x2011;sustaining; or</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS03_P2098" base="F4231617">a presumption that a transferred set of activities and assets in the development stage that has not commenced planned principal operations cannot be a business.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
