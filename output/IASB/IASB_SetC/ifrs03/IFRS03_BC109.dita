In other words, its financial position should reflect the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date&#x2014;not before or after they are obtained or assumed. Moreover, the acquirer&#x2019;s financial statements for the period should include only the cash inflows and outflows, revenues and expenses and other effects of the acquiree&#x2019;s operations after the acquisition date.</p></body></paragraph>
