Use of different accounting methods for the same set of facts and circumstances makes the resulting information less comparable and thus less useful for making economic decisions. As discussed in <xref base="F16122182" href="IFRS03_gBC29-BC54.dita#IFRS03_gBC29-BC54" id="IFRS03_X1255">paragraphs BC29&#x2013;BC35</xref>, the boards concluded that all business combinations are economically similar. Accordingly, use of the same method to account for all combinations enhances the comparability of the resulting financial reporting information. Both boards observed that the acquisition method, but not the pooling method, could reasonably be applied to all business combinations in which one party to the combination obtains control over the combined entity.</p></body></paragraph>
