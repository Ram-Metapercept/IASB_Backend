For a step acquisition, that process involved accumulating the costs or carrying amounts of earlier purchases of interests in an entity, which may have occurred years or decades ago. Those amounts were added to the current costs to purchase incremental interests in the acquiree on the acquisition date. The accumulated amounts of those purchases were then allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Allocating the accumulated amounts generally resulted in recognising the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree at a mixture of current exchange prices and carry&#x2011;forward book values for each earlier purchase rather than at their acquisition&#x2011;date fair values. Users of financial statements have long criticised those practices as resulting in information that lacks consistency, understandability and usefulness. For example, in response to the September 1991 FASB Discussion Memorandum <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Consolidation Policy and Procedures</ph></ph>, an organisation representing lending officers said:</p><lq> <p id="IFRS03_P2347" base="F4232288">[We believe] that the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary [acquiree] reported in the consolidation should reflect the full values established by the exchange transaction in which they were purchased. ... [We believe] the current practice of reporting individual assets and liabilities at a mixture of some current exchange prices and some carry&#x2011;forward book values is <b>dangerously misleading</b>.
