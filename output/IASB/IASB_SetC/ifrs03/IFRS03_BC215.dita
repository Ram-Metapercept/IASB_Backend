However, feedback from constituents and staff research indicated that it was unlikely that the term <i>undue cost or effort</i> would be applied consistently. Therefore, such a requirement would be unlikely to increase appreciably the consistency with which different entities measured non&#x2011;controlling interests.</p></body></paragraph>
