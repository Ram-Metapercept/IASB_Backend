The IASB observed that, for lessors who choose the cost option in <xref base="F16122382" href="../ias40/IAS40_TOC0001.dita#IAS40_TOC0001" id="IFRS03_X1320">IAS 40</xref>, both <xref base="F16122413" href="../ias16/IAS16_TOC.dita#IAS16_TOC0001" id="IFRS03_X1321">IAS 16</xref> and <xref base="F16122415" href="../ias38/IAS38_TOC0001.dita#IAS38_TOC0001" id="IFRS03_X1322">IAS 38</xref> require use of a depreciation or amortisation method that reflects the pattern in which the entity expects to consume the asset&#x2019;s future economic benefits. In addition, <xref base="F16122416" href="../ias16/IAS16_TOC.dita#IAS16_TOC0001" id="IFRS03_X1323">IAS 16</xref> requires each part of an item of property, plant and equipment that has a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item to be depreciated separately. Thus, an entity would be required to adjust the depreciation or amortisation method for the leased asset to reflect the timing of cash flows attributable to the underlying leases. Therefore, although the presentation of operating leases and the underlying leased assets in the statement of financial position will differ depending on whether an entity applies IFRSs or US GAAP, the IASB observed that the identifiable net assets and the depreciation or amortisation recognised in the post&#x2011;combination financial statements will be the same.</p></body></paragraph>
