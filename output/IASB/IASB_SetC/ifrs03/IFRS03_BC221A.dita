The Board decided to limit the choice to non&#x2011;controlling interests that are present ownership instruments and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the entity&#x2019;s net assets in the event of liquidation. The amendment requires the acquirer to measure all other components of non&#x2011;controlling interest at the acquisition&#x2011;date fair value, unless IFRSs require another measurement basis. For example, if a share&#x2011;based payment transaction is classified as equity, an entity measures it in accordance with <xref base="F16122553" href="../ifrs02/IFRS02_TOC.dita#IFRS02_TOC0001" id="IFRS03_X1361">IFRS 2 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Share&#x2011;based Payment</ph></ph></xref>. Without this amendment, if the acquirer chose to measure non&#x2011;controlling interest at its proportionate share of the acquiree&#x2019;s identifiable net assets, the acquirer might have measured some equity instruments at nil. In the Board&#x2019;s view, this would result in not recognising economic interests that other parties have in the acquiree. Therefore, the Board amended <xref base="F16122554" href="IFRS03_TOC.dita#IFRS03_TOC0001" id="IFRS03_X1362">IFRS 3</xref> to limit the scope of the measurement choice.</p></body></paragraph>
