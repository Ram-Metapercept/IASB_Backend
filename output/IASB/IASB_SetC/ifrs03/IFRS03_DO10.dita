Thus, purchased goodwill is the amount implicit in the acquisition transaction and excludes any goodwill attributable to non&#x2011;controlling interests. This method gives rise to more reliable measurement because it is based on the purchase consideration, which can usually be reliably measured, and it reflects faithfully the acquisition transaction to which the non&#x2011;controlling interests were not a party.</p></body></paragraph>
