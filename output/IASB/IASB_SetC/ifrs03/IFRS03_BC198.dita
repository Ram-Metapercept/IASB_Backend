Measurement at fair value also provides information that is more comparable and understandable than measurement at cost or on the basis of allocating the total cost of an acquisition. Both IFRS 3 and SFAS 141 required allocation of that cost on the basis of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. However, other guidance in those standards required measurements that were other than fair value. Moreover, SFAS 141&#x2019;s requirements for measuring identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition achieved in stages (a step acquisition) and in acquisitions of less than all of the equity interests in the acquiree resulted in another difference between fair value measurement of identifiable assets and liabilities and the process of accumulating and allocating costs. Those requirements were the same as the benchmark treatment in IAS 22, which IFRS 3 replaced. The following paragraphs discuss both the IASB&#x2019;s reasons for that change to IAS 22 and the FASB&#x2019;s reasons for the change to SFAS 141&#x2019;s requirements for step acquisitions, as well as providing additional discussion of the reasons for the fair value measurement principle in the revised standards.</p></body></paragraph>
