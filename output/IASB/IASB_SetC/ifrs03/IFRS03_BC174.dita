For that reason, the IASB decided to propose consequential amendments to <xref id="IFRS03_X1333" base="F16122455" href="../ias38/IAS38_TOC0001.dita#IAS38_TOC0001">IAS 38</xref> to remove the reliability of measurement criterion for intangible assets acquired in a business combination. In redeliberating the proposals in the 2005 Exposure Draft, the IASB affirmed those amendments to <xref id="IFRS03_X1334" base="F16122456" href="../ias38/IAS38_TOC0001.dita#IAS38_TOC0001">IAS 38</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
