The PIR       of IFRS 3 and a PIR of SFAS 141(R) identified similar difficulties in applying the definition       of a business. Moreover, the FASB received feedback from many stakeholders that the definition       of a business in US GAAP was, in practice, viewed as capturing a broader range of transactions       than the identical definition in IFRS 3. Consequently, the FASB amended US GAAP in 2017 by       issuing Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-01 <i>Clarifying the Definition of a Business</i> (FASB       2017 Amendments). The 2018 Amendments addressed the issues identified during the PIR of IFRS 3       and, though worded differently, are based on conclusions similar to those reached by the FASB.       The Board concluded that its 2018 Amendments and the FASB 2017 Amendments could together be       expected to lead to more consistency in applying the definition of a business across entities       applying US GAAP and entities applying IFRS Standards.</p></body></paragraph>
