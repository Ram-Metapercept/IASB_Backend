The objectives, which are stated in <xref id="IFRS03_X1531" base="F16382837" href="IFRS03_59.dita#IFRS03_59">paragraphs 59</xref> and <xref id="IFRS03_X1532" base="F16382838" href="IFRS03_61.dita#IFRS03_61">61</xref> of the revised IFRS 3, are, in substance, the same as those in IFRS 3 and the 2005 Exposure Draft. Respondents to the 2005 Exposure Draft who discussed the proposed disclosures generally agreed with the disclosure objectives. In reconsidering that exposure draft, however, the boards noted that the third objective in IFRS 3, to provide information that enables users of an entity&#x2019;s financial statements to evaluate changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the period, is effectively included in the objective in <xref id="IFRS03_X1533" base="F16382839" href="IFRS03_61.dita#IFRS03_61">paragraph 61</xref>. Thus, the boards combined those two objectives.</p></body></paragraph>
