In other words, the initial measurement requirements for assets and liabilities arising from contingencies recognised at the acquisition date have converged. However, the boards acknowledge that the subsequent measurement requirements differ because SFAS 5&#x2019;s measurement guidance differs from that in <xref base="F16122710" href="../ias37/IAS37_TOC.dita#IAS37_TOC0001" id="IFRS03_X1404">IAS 37</xref>.
