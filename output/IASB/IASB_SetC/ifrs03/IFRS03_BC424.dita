The FASB observed that making post&#x2011;combination distinctions might be too costly or impossible if the operations of the acquiree are integrated with those of the acquirer. Although users acknowledged that point, they indicated that information about actual post&#x2011;combination revenues and earnings is preferable to the pro forma disclosures and should be required whenever possible. Some also said that distinguishing acquired revenues from organic revenues is most important and suggested that acquirers should be required to provide that information for a twelve&#x2011;month period following an acquisition rather than only to the end of the annual period.</p></body></paragraph>
