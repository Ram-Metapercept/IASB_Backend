For reasons identified in those standards, application of the measurement methods they require generally does not result in the amount at which market participants would exchange an award at a particular date&#x2014;its fair value at that date. Therefore, the revised standards provide an exception to the measurement principle for share&#x2011;based payment awards. The reasons for that exception are essentially the same as the reasons already discussed for other exceptions to its recognition and measurement principles that the revised standards provide. For example, as with both deferred tax assets and liabilities and assets and liabilities related to employee benefit arrangements, initial measurement of share&#x2011;based payment awards at their acquisition&#x2011;date fair values would cause difficulties with the subsequent accounting for those awards in accordance with IFRS 2 or SFAS 123(R).</p></body></paragraph>
