Some respondents to the 2005 Exposure Draft favoured that alternative because they thought that changes in the fair value of contingent consideration effectively resolve differing views of the acquirer and the former owners of the acquiree about the acquisition&#x2011;date fair value of the acquiree. The boards acknowledged that a conclusive determination at the acquisition date of the fair value of a liability for contingent consideration might not be practicable in the limited circumstances in which particular information is not available at that date. As discussed in more detail in <xref href="IFRS03_gBC390-BC400.dita" scope="local" id="IFRS03_X1461">paragraphs BC390&#x2013;BC400</xref>, the boards decided that the revised standards should provide for provisional measurement of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed or incurred, including liabilities for contingent payments, in those circumstances.</p></body></paragraph>
