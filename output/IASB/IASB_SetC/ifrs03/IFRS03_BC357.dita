Rather, those subsequent changes in value are generally directly related to post&#x2011;combination events and changes in circumstances related to the combined entity. Thus, subsequent changes in value for post&#x2011;combination events and circumstances should not affect the measurement of the consideration transferred or goodwill on the acquisition date. (The boards acknowledge that some changes in fair value might result from events and circumstances related in part to a pre&#x2011;combination period. But that part of the change is usually indistinguishable from the part related to the post&#x2011;combination period and the boards concluded that the benefits in those limited circumstances that might result from making such fine distinctions would not justify the costs that such a requirement would impose.)</p></body></paragraph>
