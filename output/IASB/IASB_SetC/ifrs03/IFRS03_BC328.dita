Therefore, goodwill is measured as a residual, which is consistent with IFRS 3 and SFAS 141, in which the IASB and the FASB, respectively, concluded that direct measurement of goodwill is not possible. The boards did not reconsider measuring goodwill as a residual in the second phase of the business combinations project. However, the boards simplified the measurement of goodwill acquired in a business combination achieved in stages (a step acquisition). In accordance with IFRS 3 and SFAS 141, an entity that acquired another entity in a step acquisition measured goodwill by reference to the cost of each step and the related fair value of the underlying identifiable net assets acquired. This process was costly because it required the acquirer in a step acquisition to determine the amounts allocated to the identifiable net assets acquired at the date of each acquisition, even if those steps occurred years or decades earlier. In contrast, the revised standards require goodwill to be measured once&#x2014;at the acquisition date. Thus, the revised standards reduce the complexity and costs of accounting for step acquisitions.</p></body></paragraph>
