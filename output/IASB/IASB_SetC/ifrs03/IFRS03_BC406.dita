The requirement to disclose goodwill by reportable segment was limited to entities that are within the scope of FASB Statement No. 131 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information</ph></ph>. That exposure draft also proposed requiring disclosure of the amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes if the goodwill initially recognised in a material business combination was significant in relation to the total cost of the acquiree. After considering the comments of respondents, the FASB affirmed its conclusion that the information would be useful in estimating the amount and timing of future impairment losses, and SFAS 141 required that disclosure.</p></body></paragraph>
