Instead, it referred to EITF Issue No. 98&#x2011;3 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Determining Whether a Nonmonetary Transaction Involves Receipt of Productive Assets or of a Business</ph></ph> for guidance on whether a group of net assets constitutes a business. Some constituents said that particular aspects of the definition and the related guidance in EITF Issue 98&#x2011;3 were both unnecessarily restrictive and open to misinterpretation. They suggested that the FASB should reconsider that definition and guidance as part of this phase of the project, and it agreed to do so. In addition to considering how its definition and guidance might be improved, the FASB, in conjunction with the IASB, decided that the boards should strive to develop a joint definition of a business.</p></body></paragraph>
