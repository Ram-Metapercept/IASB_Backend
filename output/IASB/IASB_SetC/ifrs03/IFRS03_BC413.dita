Therefore, IFRS 3 carried forward the related disclosure requirements in IAS 22, amended as necessary to reflect changes IFRS 3 made to the provisions of IAS 22. For example, IAS 22 required disclosure of the amount of any adjustment during the period to goodwill or &#x2018;negative goodwill&#x2019; resulting from subsequent identification or changes in value of the acquiree&#x2019;s identifiable assets and liabilities. IFRS 3 required an acquirer, with specified exceptions, to adjust the initial accounting for a combination after that accounting was complete only to correct an error. Thus, IFRS 3 revised the IAS 22 disclosure requirement to require disclosure of information about error corrections required to be disclosed by <xref base="F16382757" href="../ias08/IAS08_TOC.dita#IAS08_TOC0001" id="IFRS03_X1526">IAS 8</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
