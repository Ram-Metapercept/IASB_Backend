As noted above, the proposal in the 2005 Exposure Draft was generally consistent with US GAAP for business combinations. However, FASB Statement No. 157 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Fair Value Measurements</ph></ph> (SFAS 157) does not provide guidance on the <i>unit of valuation</i>&#x2014;the level at which an asset or liability is aggregated or disaggregated to determine what is being measured. The IASB also does not have general guidance on determining the unit of valuation. However, <xref id="IFRS03_X1317" base="F16122379" href="../ias40/IAS40_TOC0001.dita#IAS40_TOC0001">IAS 40 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Investment Property</ph></ph></xref> provides that the fair value of investment property takes into account rental income from current leases, and the IASB understands that practice in measuring the fair value of investment property is to take into account the contractual terms of the leases and other contracts in place relating to the asset.</p></body></paragraph>
