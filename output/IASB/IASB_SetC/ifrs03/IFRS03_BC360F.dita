Consequently, the IASB decided to amend <xref id="IFRS03_X1479" base="F68305103" href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_5.7.5.dita#IFRS09_5.7.5">paragraph 5.7.5 of IFRS 9</xref> to ensure that any change in the fair value of investments in equity instruments that are contingent consideration in a business combination should be presented in profit or loss. The IASB noted that it was unlikely that contingent consideration that is an asset would meet the definition of equity. However, it decided to amend the paragraph to ensure that all contingent consideration that is made up of financial instruments is accounted for consistently.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
