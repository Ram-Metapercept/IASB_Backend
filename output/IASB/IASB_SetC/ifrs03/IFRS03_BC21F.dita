Consequently, the Board       decided that to be considered a business, an acquired set of activities and assets       must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together       significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The Board incorporated       this requirement in <xref href="ifrs03/IFRS03_B8.dita">paragraph B8</xref>. To clarify that a business can exist without       including all of the inputs and processes needed to create outputs, the Board       replaced the term &#x2018;ability to create outputs&#x2019; with &#x2018;ability to contribute to the       creation of outputs&#x2019; in <xref href="ifrs03/IFRS03_B7.dita">paragraph B7 of IFRS 3</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
