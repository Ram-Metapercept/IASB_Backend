It also       permits an entity to apply the amendments before their effective date, without disclosing that       it has done so. The IASB concluded that no significant benefits would be gained from requiring       either retrospective application or disclosure of early application. The IASB reached this       conclusion because it did not expect the amendments to change significantly the population of       assets and liabilities recognised in a business combination.</p></body></paragraph>
