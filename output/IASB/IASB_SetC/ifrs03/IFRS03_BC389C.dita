In response, the IASB clarified that an entity remeasures its entire previously held interest in the joint operation. IFRS 3 views a business combination achieved in stages as a transaction in which an acquirer exchanges its status as an owner of a non-controlling interest in a business for a controlling interest in all of the underlying assets and liabilities of that business. Accordingly, when an acquirer obtains control of a business that is a joint operation, it effectively (a) derecognises its previously held interest (ie non-controlling interest) in the joint operation, and (b) recognises a controlling interest in all of the assets and liabilities of the former joint operation. The IASB observed that remeasuring the entire previously held interest would result in an entity recognising the same gain or loss on remeasurement that it would have recognised had it otherwise disposed of its previously held interest in the joint operation in an exchange transaction.</p></body></paragraph>
