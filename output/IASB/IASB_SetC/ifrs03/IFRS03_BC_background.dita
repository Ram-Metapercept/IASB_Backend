The                 Board decided to address the accounting for business combinations in two phases.</p>               <p base="F4231545" id="IFRS03_P2070">As part of the first phase, the Board published                 in December 2002 ED 3 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Business Combinations</ph></ph>, together with an                 exposure draft of proposed related amendments to IAS 36 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Impairment of Assets</ph></ph> and <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 38</ph>                   <ph outputclass="standard_title">Intangible Assets</ph></ph>, with a comment                 deadline of 4 April 2003. The Board received 136 comment letters.</p>               <p base="F4231549" id="IFRS03_P2071">The Board concluded the first phase in March 2004                 by issuing simultaneously IFRS 3 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Business Combinations</ph></ph> and revised                 versions of IAS 36 and <xref base="F16122072" href="../ias38/IAS38_TOC0001.dita#IAS38_TOC0001" id="IFRS03_X1228">IAS 38</xref>. The Board&#x2019;s                 primary conclusion in the first phase was that virtually all business combinations                 are acquisitions. Accordingly, the Board decided to require the use of one method of                 accounting for business combinations&#x2014;the acquisition method.</p>               <p base="F4231551" id="IFRS03_P2072">The US Financial Accounting Standards Board                 (FASB) also conducted a project on business combinations in multiple phases. The                 FASB concluded its first phase in June 2001 by issuing FASB Statements No. 141 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Business Combinations</ph></ph> (SFAS 141) and                 No. 142 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets</ph></ph>.                 The scope of that first phase was similar to IFRS 3 and the FASB reached similar                 conclusions on the major issues.</p>               <p base="F4231554" id="IFRS03_P2073">The two boards began deliberating the second                 phase of their projects at about the same time. They decided that a significant                 improvement could be made to financial reporting if they had similar standards for                 accounting for business combinations. They therefore agreed to conduct the second                 phase of the project as a joint effort with the objective of reaching the same                 conclusions.</p>               <p base="F4231555" id="IFRS03_P2074">The second phase of the project addressed the                 guidance for applying the acquisition method. In June 2005 the boards published an                 exposure draft of revisions to IFRS 3 and SFAS 141, together with exposure drafts of                 related amendments to IAS 27 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Consolidated and Separate Financial                     Statements</ph></ph> and Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Consolidated Financial Statements</ph></ph>, with                 a comment deadline of 28 October 2005. The boards received more than 280 comment                 letters.</p>               <p base="F4231558" id="IFRS03_P2075">The boards concluded the second phase of the                 project by issuing their revised standards, <xref base="F16122073" href="IFRS03_TOC.dita#IFRS03_TOC0001" id="IFRS03_X1229">IFRS 3 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Business Combinations</ph></ph></xref> (as                 revised in 2008) and FASB Statement No. 141 (revised 2007) <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Business Combinations</ph></ph> and the related                 amendments to IAS 27 and FASB Statement No. 160 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated                     Financial Statements</ph></ph>.</p>             </entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></body></topic>
