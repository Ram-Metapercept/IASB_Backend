This transaction results in a significant change in the nature of, and economic circumstances surrounding, any interest in the joint operation; remeasuring the previously held interest at fair value is therefore warranted. Accordingly, the IASB added <xref base="F74056368" href="IFRS03_42A.dita#IFRS03_42A/IFRS03_42A_V1" id="IFRS03_X1516">paragraph 42A</xref> to clarify that, when obtaining control of a business that is a joint operation, the acquirer applies the requirements for a business combination achieved in stages, including remeasuring its previously held interest in the joint operation at its acquisition-date fair value.</p></body></paragraph>
