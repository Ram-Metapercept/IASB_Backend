The boards concluded that essentially the same considerations discussed in <xref id="IFRS03_X1424" base="F16122791" href="IFRS03_BC280.dita#IFRS03_BC280">paragraph BC280</xref> for deferred tax assets and liabilities also apply to employee benefits. In addition, the FASB observed that FASB Statements No. 43 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Accounting for Compensated Absences</ph></ph> and 112 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Employers&#x2019; Accounting for Postemployment Benefits</ph></ph> require recognition of a liability for compensated absences or post&#x2011;employment benefits, respectively, only if payment is probable. Arguably, a liability for those benefits exists, at least in some circumstances, regardless of whether payment is probable. Accordingly, to make it clear that the acquirer should apply the recognition and measurement requirements of <xref id="IFRS03_X1425" base="F77794158" href="../ias19/IAS19_TOC0001.dita#IAS19_TOC0001">IAS 19</xref> or applicable US GAAP without separately considering the extent to which those requirements are consistent with the principles in the revised standards, the boards exempted employee benefit obligations from both the recognition and the measurement principles.</p></body></paragraph>
