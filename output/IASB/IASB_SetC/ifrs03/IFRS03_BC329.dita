Thus, SFAS 141(R) eliminates the past practice of not recognising the portion of goodwill related to the non&#x2011;controlling interests in subsidiaries that are not wholly&#x2011;owned. However, as discussed in <xref id="IFRS03_X1441" base="F16122866" href="IFRS03_BC209.dita#IFRS03_BC209">paragraphs BC209&#x2013;BC211</xref>, the IASB concluded that the revised IFRS 3 should permit entities to measure any non&#x2011;controlling interest in an acquiree as its proportionate share of the acquiree&#x2019;s identifiable net assets. If an entity chooses that alternative, only the goodwill related to the acquirer is recognised.</p></body></paragraph>
