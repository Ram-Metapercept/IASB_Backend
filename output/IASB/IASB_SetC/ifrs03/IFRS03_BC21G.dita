Some participants in the PIR of IFRS 3 noted that adopting that       perspective requires a fact-driven assessment that does not consider the business rationale,       strategic considerations and objectives of the acquirer. They expressed concerns that       excluding those factors would not result in the most useful information for users of financial       statements. Nevertheless, the Board concluded that the assessment should continue to be made       from a market participant&#x2019;s perspective and to be driven by facts that indicate the current       state and condition of what has been acquired, rather than by considering what the acquirer       might intend to do with the acquired set of activities and assets. Basing this determination       on facts, rather than on the intentions of the acquirer, helps to prevent similar transactions       being accounted for differently. In the Board&#x2019;s view, bringing the business rationale,       strategic considerations and objectives of the acquirer into the determination would have made       the determination more subjective and thus would have increased diversity in practice.       Consequently, the Board did not change <xref href="ifrs03/IFRS03_B11.dita">paragraph         B11</xref> in this regard.</p></body></paragraph>
