To avoid this problem, the IASB added paragraph 21B to <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 3</ph></ph>. This       paragraph makes an exception from the requirements of paragraph 11 for liabilities and       contingent liabilities that would be within the scope of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 37</ph></ph> or <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRIC 21</ph></ph> if incurred separately, rather than       assumed in a business combination. The exception requires an entity to apply criteria in <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 37</ph></ph> or <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRIC 21</ph></ph> respectively       to determine whether a present obligation exists at the acquisition date. The exception refers       to <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRIC 21</ph></ph> as well       as <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 37</ph></ph> because,       although <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRIC 21</ph></ph>       is an interpretation of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS           37</ph></ph>, it also applies to levies whose timing and amount are certain and so are       outside the scope of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS           37</ph></ph>.</p></body></paragraph>
