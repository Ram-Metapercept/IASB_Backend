Costs associated with restructuring or exiting an acquiree&#x2019;s activities that are not liabilities at that date are recognised as post&#x2011;combination activities or transactions of the combined entity when the costs are incurred. In considering acquired restructuring or exit activities the FASB and the IASB began at different points because the requirements of SFAS 141 and IFRS 3 on the issue differed.</p></body></paragraph>
