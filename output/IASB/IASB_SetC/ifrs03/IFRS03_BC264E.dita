This will be the case if it is not probable that an       outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, or       if the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. The IASB added       paragraph 21C to <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 3</ph></ph> to clarify that, if the present obligation identified applying       paragraph 21B meets the definition of a contingent liability, paragraph 23 of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 3</ph></ph> also       applies to that contingent liability.</p></body></paragraph>
