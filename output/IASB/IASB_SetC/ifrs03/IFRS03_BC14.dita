Accordingly, the boards decided to replace the term <i>purchase method</i>, which was previously used to describe the method of accounting for business combinations that the revised standards require, with the term <i>acquisition method</i>. To avoid confusion, this Basis for Conclusions uses that term throughout, including when it refers to IFRS 3 and SFAS 141 (and earlier exposure drafts or other documents), which used the term <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">purchase method</ph></ph>.</p></body></paragraph>
