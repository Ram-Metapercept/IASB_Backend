It required those definitions to be used when deciding whether to recognise assets and liabilities as part of a business combination. In developing the revised <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting</ph></ph>, issued in 2018 (2018 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph>), the IASB considered whether it should replace that reference with a reference to the revised definitions in the 2018 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph>. In some cases, applying the revised definitions could change which assets and liabilities qualify for recognition in a business combination. In some such cases, the post-acquisition accounting required by other IFRS Standards could then lead to immediate derecognition of assets or liabilities recognised in a business combination, resulting in so-called <i>Day 2 gains or losses</i> that do not depict an economic gain or loss.</p></bodydiv></body></paragraph>
