Previously, FASB Interpretation No. 4 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method</ph></ph> (FASB Interpretation 4) required an acquirer to measure and immediately recognise as expense tangible and intangible assets to be used in research and development that had no alternative future use. A research and development asset was recognised as such only if it had an alternative future use. In contrast, IFRS 3 did not require a research and development asset to have an alternative future use for it to be recognised. The revised standards therefore do not change the provisions of IFRS 3 on that issue. Accordingly, most of the discussion in <xref id="IFRS03_X1324" base="F16122417" href="IFRS03_BC150.dita#IFRS03_BC150">paragraphs BC150&#x2013;BC156</xref> pertains to the FASB&#x2019;s consideration of this issue.</p></body></paragraph>
