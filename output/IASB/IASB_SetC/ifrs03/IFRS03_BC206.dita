The result of those mechanics would have been that the non&#x2011;controlling interest was effectively measured as the &#x2018;final residual&#x2019; in a business combination. That is to say, the reported amount of the non&#x2011;controlling interest depended on the amount of goodwill attributed to it, and goodwill is measured as a residual. Thus, in a sense, a non&#x2011;controlling interest would have been the residual after allocating the residual, or the residual of a residual.</p></body></paragraph>
