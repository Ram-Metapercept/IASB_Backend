They decided to address that concern by limiting the extent of gain that can be recognised. Thus, the revised standards provide that a gain on a bargain purchase is measured as the excess of:</p><ol id="IFRS03_L0122" base="F4232784" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS03_P2612" base="F4232785">the net of the acquisition&#x2011;date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed; over</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS03_P2613" base="F4232787">the acquisition&#x2011;date fair value of the consideration transferred plus the recognised amount of any non&#x2011;controlling interest in the acquiree and, if the transaction is an acquisition achieved in stages, the acquisition&#x2011;date fair value of the acquirer&#x2019;s previously held equity interest in the acquiree.</p></li></ol><p id="IFRS03_P2614" base="F4232788">That means that a gain on a bargain purchase and goodwill cannot both be recognised for the same business combination. The 2005 Exposure Draft defined a bargain purchase as a transaction in which the fair value of the acquirer&#x2019;s interest in the acquiree exceeds the consideration transferred for it, but it would have required that any resulting goodwill should be written off before a gain was recognised. The result of the revised standards&#x2019; requirement is the same, but there will be no goodwill to write off if the gain is measured with reference to the identifiable net assets acquired rather than the fair value of the acquirer&#x2019;s interest in the acquiree. In addition, the revised standards require (<xref id="IFRS03_X1508" base="F16382638" href="IFRS03_B64.dita#IFRS03_B64">paragraph B64(n)</xref> of the revised IFRS 3) the acquirer to disclose information about a gain recognised on a bargain purchase.</p></body></paragraph>
