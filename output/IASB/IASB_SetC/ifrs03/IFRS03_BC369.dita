<paragraph id="IFRS03_BC369" base="F4232749" principles="no"><paranum>BC369</paranum><prolog><data name="standard_number" value="IFRS 3"/><data name="paranum" value="BC369"/></prolog><body><p id="IFRS03_P2594">The boards acknowledge that the cost&#x2011;accumulation models in IFRS 3 and SFAS 141 included some acquisition&#x2011;related costs as part of the carrying amount of the assets acquired. The boards also acknowledge that all asset acquisitions are similar transactions that, in concept, should be accounted for similarly, regardless of whether assets are acquired separately or as part of a group of assets that may meet the definition of a business. However, as noted in <xref id="IFRS03_X1502" base="F16382533" href="IFRS03_BC20.dita#IFRS03_BC20">paragraph BC20</xref>, the boards decided not to extend the scope of the revised standards to all acquisitions of groups of assets. Therefore, the boards accept that, at this time, accounting for most acquisition&#x2011;related costs separately from the business combination, generally as an expense as incurred for services received in connection with a combination, differs from some standards or accepted practices that require or permit particular acquisition&#x2011;related costs to be included in the cost of an asset acquisition. The boards concluded, however, that the revised standards improve financial reporting by eliminating inconsistencies in accounting for acquisition&#x2011;related costs in connection with a business combination and by applying the fair value measurement principle to all business combinations. The boards also observed that in practice under IFRS 3 and SFAS 141, most acquisition&#x2011;related costs were subsumed in goodwill, which was also not consistent with accounting for asset acquisitions.</p></body></paragraph>
