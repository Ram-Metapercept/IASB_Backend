The objective of that project was to develop guidance for combinations of two or more mutual entities. In October 2001 the FASB and the AcSB held a round&#x2011;table discussion with representatives of mutual banks, credit unions, co&#x2011;operatives and other mutual entities. In January 2004 the FASB met representatives of organisations of co&#x2011;operative and other mutual entities to discuss its tentative conclusions and specific concerns raised by constituents. In addition, the FASB conducted field visits to three mutual entities in 2004.</p></body></paragraph>
