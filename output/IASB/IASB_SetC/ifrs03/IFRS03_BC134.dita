The criteria in IAS 22 were similar to those in EITF Issue 95&#x2011;3. In developing ED 3 and IFRS 3, the IASB considered the view that a restructuring provision that was not a liability of the acquiree at the acquisition date should nonetheless be recognised by the acquirer as part of allocating the cost of the combination if the specified conditions were met. Those supporting this view, including some respondents to ED 3, argued that:</p><ol id="IFRS03_L0100" base="F4231992" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS03_P2264" base="F4231993">the estimated cost of terminating or reducing the activities of the acquiree would have influenced the price paid by the acquirer for the acquiree and therefore should be taken into account in measuring goodwill.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS03_P2265" base="F4231995">the acquirer is committed to the costs of terminating or reducing the activities of the acquiree because of the business combination. In other words, the combination is the past event that gives rise to a present obligation to terminate or reduce the activities of the acquiree.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
