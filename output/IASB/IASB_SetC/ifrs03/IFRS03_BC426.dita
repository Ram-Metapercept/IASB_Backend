In considering the responses to the exposure draft and opportunities for further convergence, the FASB decided to revise its disclosures to focus on revenues and earnings, which is consistent with the related requirements of the IASB. The boards observed that the term <i>results of operations</i> is not used or defined in IFRSs; it would thus have been more difficult for the IASB to converge with the disclosures initially proposed by the FASB.</p></body></paragraph>
