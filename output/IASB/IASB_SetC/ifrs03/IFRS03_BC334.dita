That illustrative guidance drew on related guidance in the FASB&#x2019;s exposure draft that preceded SFAS 157. Because SFAS 157 provides guidance on using valuation techniques such as the market approach and the income approach for measuring fair value, the FASB decided that it is unnecessary for SFAS 141(R) to provide the same guidance.</p></body></paragraph>
