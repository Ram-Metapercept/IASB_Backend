In addition, the IASB concluded that to provide a definitive basis for identifying and recognising intangible assets separately from goodwill, the concept of identifiability needed to be articulated more clearly. As a result of that consideration, which is discussed in <xref id="IFRS03_X1329" base="F16122452" href="IFRS03_BC163.dita#IFRS03_BC163">paragraphs BC163&#x2013;BC165</xref>, the IASB developed more definitive criteria for distinguishing between identifiable intangible assets and goodwill and included those criteria in both IFRS 3 and <xref id="IFRS03_X1330" base="F16122451" href="../ias38/IAS38_TOC0001.dita#IAS38_TOC0001">IAS 38</xref> (as revised in 2004).</p></body></paragraph>
