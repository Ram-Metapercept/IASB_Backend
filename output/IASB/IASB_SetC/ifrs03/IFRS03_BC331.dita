However, that is not the case if the acquirer either makes a bargain purchase or pays more than the acquiree is worth at the acquisition date if the acquirer underpays or overpays. The revised standards provide for recognising a gain in the event of a bargain purchase, but they do not provide for recognising a loss in the event of an overpayment (<xref id="IFRS03_X1445" base="F16122870" href="IFRS03_BC382.dita#IFRS03_BC382">paragraph BC382</xref>). Therefore, the boards concluded that focusing directly on the fair value of the consideration transferred rather than on the fair value of the acquirer&#x2019;s interest in the acquiree, with a presumption that the two amounts are usually equal, would be a more straightforward way of describing how to measure goodwill. (The same conclusion applies to measuring the gain on a bargain purchase, which is discussed in <xref id="IFRS03_X1446" base="F16122871" href="IFRS03_BC371.dita#IFRS03_BC371">paragraphs BC371&#x2013;BC381</xref>.) That change in focus will also avoid unproductive disputes in practice about whether the consideration transferred or another valuation technique provides the best evidence for measuring the acquirer&#x2019;s interest in the acquiree in a particular situation.</p></body></paragraph>
