Specifically, <xref base="F19767886" href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001" id="IFRS03_X1382">IAS 39</xref><xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS03_FN0054" type="fn"/> and other IFRSs define fair value as &#x2018;the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm&#x2019;s length transaction&#x2019; and the revised IFRS 3 uses that definition. SFAS 157, on the other hand, defines fair value as &#x2018;the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date&#x2019; and that definition is used in SFAS 141(R).<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS03_FN0055" type="fn"/></p></variant></body></paragraph>
