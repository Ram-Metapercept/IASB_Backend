The conflict arises because paragraph 58 refers to changes in the fair value of contingent consideration but paragraph 58(b) refers to Standards that do not require fair value as a measurement basis, for example, IAS 37. Consequently, the IASB deleted the reference to &#x201C;IAS 37 or other IFRSs as appropriate&#x201D; from paragraph 58(b). This, therefore, maintains fair value as the subsequent measurement basis for all non equity contingent consideration to which IFRS 3 applies. The IASB thinks that this clarifies the original intention for subsequent measurement of contingent consideration as explained in <xref id="IFRS03_X1482" base="F35271245" href="IFRS03_BC355.dita#IFRS03_BC355">paragraph BC355</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
