Some advocated an exception on the basis that they did not have sufficient evidence to assess the marginal benefits of reporting the acquisition&#x2011;date fair value of non&#x2011;controlling interests. Those members concluded that, generally, the fair value of the non&#x2011;controlling interest could be measured reliably, but they noted that it would be more costly to do so than measuring it at its proportionate share of the acquiree&#x2019;s identifiable net assets. Those members observed that many respondents had indicated that they saw little information of value in the reported non&#x2011;controlling interest, no matter how it is measured.</p></body></paragraph>
