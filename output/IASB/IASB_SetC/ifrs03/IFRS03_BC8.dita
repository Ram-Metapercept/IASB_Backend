That definition would encompass all transactions or other events that are within the scope of the revised standards. The FASB concluded, however, that the definition of a business combination in IFRS 3 was too broad for its purposes because it would allow for the inclusion in a business combination of one or more businesses that the acquirer does not control.</p></body></paragraph>
