The IASB&#x2019;s <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph><xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS03_FN0037" type="fn"/> <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements</ph></ph> says that &#x2018;The economic decisions that are taken by users of financial statements require an evaluation of the ability of an entity to generate cash and cash equivalents and of the timing and certainty of their generation&#x2019; (<xref id="IFRS03_X1252" base="F74965531" href="IFRS03_15.dita#IFRS03_15">paragraph 15</xref>). FASB Concepts Statement No. 1 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Objectives of Financial Reporting by Business Enterprises</ph></ph> indicates that &#x2018;... financial reporting should provide information to help investors, creditors, and others assess the amounts, timing, and uncertainty of prospective net cash inflows to the related enterprise&#x2019; (<xref id="IFRS03_X1253" base="F74965534" href="IFRS03_37.dita#IFRS03_37">paragraph 37</xref>; footnote reference omitted). Neither the cash&#x2011;generating abilities of the combined entity nor its future cash flows generally are affected by the method used to account for the combination. However, fair values reflect the expected cash flows associated with acquired assets and assumed liabilities. Because the pooling method records the net assets acquired at their carrying amounts rather than at their fair values, the information that the pooling method provides about the cash&#x2011;generating abilities of those net assets is less useful than that provided by the acquisition method.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
