Entities will need to evaluate the nature of those inputs to assess whether that       process is substantive. The Board observed that many entities in the       development stage will meet this criterion because technology, intellectual       property, or other assets are being developed into a good or service. Conversely,       if a set is producing outputs at the acquisition date, the set already contains       inputs that are being converted into outputs, and, therefore, there is no need to       consider specifically the type of inputs to which the acquired process is applied.</p></body></paragraph>
