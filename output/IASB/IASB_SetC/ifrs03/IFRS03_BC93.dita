The IASB observed that using the control concept as the basis for identifying the acquirer is consistent with using the control concept in <xref id="IFRS03_X1283" base="F16164824" href="../ias27/IAS27_TOC0001.dita#IAS27_TOC0001">IAS 27 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements</ph></ph></xref> to define the boundaries of the reporting entity and to provide the basis for establishing the existence of a parent&#x2011;subsidiary relationship.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS03_FN0039" type="fn"/> IFRS 3 also carried forward the guidance in IAS 22 that control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the other entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. IFRS 3 also provided the same guidance as IAS 22 for identifying the acquirer if one of the combining entities might have obtained control even if it does not acquire more than one&#x2011;half of the voting rights of another combining entity.</p></body></paragraph>
