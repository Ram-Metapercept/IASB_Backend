The IASB and the FASB considered those concerns in the context of related requirements in their standards on share&#x2011;based payments (<xref base="F16122906" href="../ifrs02/IFRS02_TOC.dita#IFRS02_TOC0001" id="IFRS03_X1453">IFRS 2</xref> and SFAS 123(R), respectively), neither of which requires performance conditions that are not market conditions to be included in the market&#x2011;based measure of an award of share&#x2011;based payment at the grant date. For example, remuneration cost is recognised for a share option with vesting requirements that depend on achievement of an earnings target based on the number of equity instruments expected to vest and any such cost recognised during the vesting period is reversed if the target is not achieved. Both <xref base="F16122907" href="../ifrs02/IFRS02_TOC.dita#IFRS02_TOC0001" id="IFRS03_X1454">IFRS 2</xref> and SFAS 123(R) cite constituents&#x2019; concerns about the measurability at the grant date of the expected outcomes associated with performance conditions as part of the reason for that treatment.</p></body></paragraph>
