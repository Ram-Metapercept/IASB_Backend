The conclusions carried forward include, among others, the requirement to apply the <i>purchase method</i> (which the revised standards refer to as the <i>acquisition method</i>) to account for all business combinations and the identifiability criteria for recognising an intangible asset separately from goodwill. This Basis for Conclusions includes the reasons for those conclusions, as well as the reasons for the conclusions the boards reached in their joint deliberations that led to the revised standards. Because the provisions of the revised standards on applying the acquisition method represent a more extensive change to SFAS 141 than to the previous version of IFRS 3, this Basis for Conclusions includes more discussion of the FASB&#x2019;s conclusions than of the IASB&#x2019;s in the second phase of their respective business combinations projects.</p></body></paragraph>
