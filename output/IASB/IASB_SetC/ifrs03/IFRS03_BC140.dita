They observed that the view described in <xref id="IFRS03_X1311" base="F16122374" href="IFRS03_BC139.dita#IFRS03_BC139">paragraph BC139(a)</xref> is essentially the same as the view of some respondents to ED 3 discussed in <xref id="IFRS03_X1312" base="F16122375" href="IFRS03_BC134.dita#IFRS03_BC134">paragraph BC134(a)</xref>. In addition, the boards noted that the acquirer does not pay the acquiree or its owners for the anticipated costs to restructure or exit activities and the acquirer&#x2019;s plans to do so do not give rise to an obligation and associated liability at the acquisition date. The acquirer ordinarily incurs a liability associated with such costs after it gains control of the acquiree&#x2019;s business.</p></body></paragraph>
