This difference arises because an entity       might recognise a liability earlier applying the 2018 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph>. Applying <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRIC 21</ph></ph>, an entity       recognises a liability to pay a levy only when it conducts the activity that triggers the       payment of the levy, whereas applying the 2018 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph>, an entity recognises a       liability when it conducts an earlier activity if:</p><ol type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>         <p id="P0002">conducting that earlier activity means the entity may have to pay a levy it would not           otherwise have had to pay; and</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>         <p id="P0003">the entity has no practical ability to avoid the later activity that will trigger payment           of the levy.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
