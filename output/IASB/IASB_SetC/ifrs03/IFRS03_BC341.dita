Some supported the proposal to measure equity securities at their fair value on the acquisition date, generally for the same reasons given in that exposure draft. Others, however, favoured use of the agreement date. They generally cited one or more of the following as support for their view:</p><ol id="IFRS03_L0117" base="F4232676" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS03_P2541" base="F4232677">An acquirer and a target entity both consider the fair value of a target entity on the agreement date in negotiating the amount of consideration to be paid. Measuring equity securities issued as consideration at fair value on the agreement date reflects the values taken into account in negotiations.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS03_P2542" base="F4232679">Changes in the fair value of the acquirer&#x2019;s equity securities between the agreement date and the acquisition date may be caused by factors unrelated to the business combination.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS03_P2543" base="F4232692">Changes in the fair value of the acquirer&#x2019;s equity securities between the agreement date and the acquisition date may result in inappropriate recognition of either a bargain purchase or artificially inflated goodwill if the fair value of those securities is measured at the acquisition date.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
