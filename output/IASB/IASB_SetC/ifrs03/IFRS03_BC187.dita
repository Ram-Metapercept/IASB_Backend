They observed that application of the acquisition method results in the initial recognition in the acquirer&#x2019;s financial statements of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Therefore, in concept, the acquirer should classify and designate all items acquired in a business combination at the acquisition date in the context of the contractual terms, economic conditions and other pertinent factors at that date. That concept underlies the classification and designation principle (<xref id="IFRS03_X1346" base="F16382524" href="IFRS03_15.dita#IFRS03_15">paragraph 15</xref> of the revised IFRS 3).</p></body></paragraph>
