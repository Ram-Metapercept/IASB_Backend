Because paragraph 58 referred to IFRS 9 (or IAS 39), which allows amortised cost measurement in some circumstances, contingent consideration that is a financial liability might be classified as being measured at amortised cost.  This would conflict with the requirement in paragraph 58 that such contingent consideration should be subsequently measured at fair value. Consequently, the IASB amended the classification requirements of IFRS 9 (and IAS 39) to ensure that the subsequent measurement requirement for contingent consideration that is a financial liability is fair value. The IASB thinks that this clarifies the original intention for subsequent measurement of contingent consideration as explained in paragraph BC355.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
