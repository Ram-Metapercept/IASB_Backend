Given that these combinations were not within the scope of IFRS 3, they may have been accounted for differently from what IFRS 3 required. The transitional provisions in IFRS 3 took into consideration that entities may have used a range of alternatives in accounting for combinations in the past. The IASB concluded that the transitional provisions for these combinations should incorporate the transitional provisions in IFRS 3 for other business combinations. In addition, the IASB concluded that the transitional provisions should provide that an entity should continue to classify prior combinations in accordance with its previous accounting for such combinations. This is consistent with the prospective approach. Those provisions are contained in <xref id="IFRS03_X1560" base="F16383126" href="IFRS03_gB68-B69.dita#IFRS03_gB68-B69">paragraphs B68 and B69</xref> of the revised IFRS 3.</p></body></paragraph>
