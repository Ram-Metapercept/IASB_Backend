In addition, some who objected to the recognition prohibition in the 2005 Exposure Draft apparently consider that an assembled workforce represents the intellectual capital of the skilled workforce&#x2014;the (often specialised) knowledge and experience that employees of an acquiree bring to their jobs. However, the boards view an assembled workforce as an existing collection of employees that permits an acquirer to continue to operate an acquired business from the acquisition date and they decided to include that definition in the revised standards (<xref id="IFRS03_X1338" base="F16122490" href="IFRS03_B37.dita#IFRS03_B37">paragraph B37</xref> of the revised IFRS 3).</p></body></paragraph>
