However, they concluded that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to identify that portion. In addition, an acquirer would not pay more for an acquiree because of tax synergies unless another bidder would also pay more; an acquirer would not knowingly pay more than necessary for the acquiree. Therefore, in some situations none (or only a very small portion) of the tax synergies are likely to be factored into the price paid. The boards also observed that the revised standards (<xref id="IFRS03_X1414" base="F16122750" href="IFRS03_51.dita#IFRS03_51">paragraph 51 of the revised IFRS 3</xref>) require only the portion of the consideration transferred for the acquiree and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the exchange for the acquiree to be included in applying the acquisition method. Excluding effects on the acquirer&#x2019;s ability to utilise its deferred tax asset is consistent with that requirement. Therefore, the boards decided to retain the treatment of changes in an acquirer&#x2019;s tax assets and liabilities proposed in the 2005 Exposure Draft.</p></body></paragraph>
