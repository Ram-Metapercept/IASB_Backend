It is also less complete because it does not reflect assets acquired or liabilities assumed that were not included in the pre&#x2011;combination financial statements of the combining entities. The pooling method also provides a less faithful representation of the combined entity&#x2019;s performance in periods after the combination. For example, by recording assets and liabilities at the carrying amounts of predecessor entities, post&#x2011;combination revenues may be overstated (and expenses understated) as the result of embedded gains that were generated by predecessor entities but not recognised by them.</p></body></paragraph>
