Measurement period adjustments result from information about assets, liabilities and non&#x2011;controlling interests <b>as of</b> the acquisition date that becomes available only after that date. In contrast, adjustments for changes in estimates generally result from changes in facts and circumstances that affect an estimate, for example, a change in technology that affects the useful life of an asset.</p></body></paragraph>
