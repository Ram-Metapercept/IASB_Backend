Professor Barth and Mr Smith support the Board&#x2019;s general view that exceptions should be avoided because they undermine principle&#x2011;based standards, but understand that they are necessary in well&#x2011;justified circumstances. Professor Barth and Mr Smith do not believe that an exception to this principle, with a free choice in applying it, is justified in this situation.</p></body></paragraph>
