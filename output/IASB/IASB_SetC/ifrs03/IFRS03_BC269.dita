An example cited by some respondents involved an acquiree&#x2019;s negotiations with another party at the acquisition date for reimbursement of costs incurred on the other party&#x2019;s behalf. How should the acquirer determine whether that contingency gave rise to an asset that should be recognised as part of the accounting for the business combination? Respondents suggested several means of dealing with element uncertainty, which generally involved introducing a threshold either for all contingencies or for the non&#x2011;contractual contingencies an acquirer is required to recognise at the acquisition date. Other respondents suggested requiring recognition of only those assets and liabilities arising from contingencies whose fair values can be reliably determined, which would be similar to the requirements of SFAS 141.</p></body></paragraph>
