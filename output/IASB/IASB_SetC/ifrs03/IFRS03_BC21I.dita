Therefore, the Board deleted the reference to such integration. Instead, as       discussed in <xref href="ifrs03/IFRS03_BC21F.dita">paragraph BC21F</xref>, the 2018 Amendments focus on whether       acquired inputs and acquired substantive processes together significantly       contribute to the ability to create outputs.</p></body></paragraph>
