To avoid the problem, the IASB decided to add a further exception to the       recognition principle in IFRS 3. The reasons for making this exception are explained in       paragraphs BC264A&#x2013;BC264E. The IASB noted that adding this exception to the recognition       principle would not only avoid <i>Day 2 gains or losses</i>; it would also avoid any changes to the       assets and liabilities recognised in a business combination ahead of any future amendments to       align <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 37</ph></ph> and <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRIC 21</ph></ph> with the 2018 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph>.</p></body></paragraph>
