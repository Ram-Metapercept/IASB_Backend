First, the amounts recognised in a business combination for non&#x2011;controlling interests and goodwill are likely to be lower (and these should be the only two items affected on initial recognition). Second, if a cash&#x2011;generating unit is subsequently impaired, any resulting impairment of goodwill recognised through income is likely to be lower than it would have been if the non&#x2011;controlling interest had been measured at fair value (although it does not affect the impairment loss attributable to the controlling interest).</p></body></paragraph>
