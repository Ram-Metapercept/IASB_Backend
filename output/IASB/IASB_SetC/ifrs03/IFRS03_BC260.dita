Combining those efforts would be a more efficient use of resources. Accordingly, the FASB decided to include disclosures that should be made in a business combination in the scope of its project on disclosures related to valuation allowances and credit quality, and the IASB will monitor that project. In the interim, the disclosures required by the revised standards (<xref id="IFRS03_X1388" base="F16122633" href="IFRS03_B64.dita#IFRS03_B64">paragraph B64(h)</xref> of the revised IFRS 3) will provide at least some, although perhaps not all, of the information users need to evaluate the credit quality of receivables acquired.</p></body></paragraph>
