The boards concluded that it was not feasible to require all employee benefit obligations assumed in a business combination to be measured at their acquisition&#x2011;date fair values. To do so would effectively require the boards to reconsider comprehensively the relevant standards for those employee benefits as a part of their business combinations projects.
