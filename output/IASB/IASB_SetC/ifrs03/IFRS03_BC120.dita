<paragraph id="IFRS03_BC120" base="F4231949" principles="no"><paranum>BC120</paranum><prolog><data name="standard_number" value="IFRS 3"/><data name="paranum" value="BC120"/></prolog><body><p id="IFRS03_P2249">The boards also concluded that the focus of the principle should be on identifying whether a business combination includes separate transactions that should be accounted for separately in accordance with their economic substance rather than solely on assessing whether a transaction is part of the exchange for the acquiree (<xref id="IFRS03_X1295" base="F16122300" href="IFRS03_B51.dita#IFRS03_B51">paragraph 51</xref> of the revised IFRS 3). Focusing solely on whether assets or liabilities are part of the exchange for the acquiree might not result in all transactions being accounted for in accordance with their economic substance. For example, if an acquirer asks the acquiree to pay some or all of the acquisition&#x2011;related costs on its behalf and the acquiree has paid those costs before the acquisition date, at the acquisition date the acquiree will show no liability for those costs. Therefore, some might think that the principle as stated in the 2005 Exposure Draft does not apply to the transactions giving rise to the acquisition&#x2011;related costs. The boards concluded that focusing instead on whether a transaction is separate from the business combination will more clearly convey the intention of the principle and thus will provide users with more relevant information about the financial effects of transactions and events entered into by the acquirer. The acquirer&#x2019;s financial statements will reflect the financial effects of all transactions for which the acquirer is responsible in accordance with their economic substance.</p></body></paragraph>
