They contended that the exchange of member interests in at least some forms of mutual entities does not constitute consideration because the interests the acquirer transfers have no economic value. The boards disagreed, noting that one mutual entity&#x2014;the acquiree&#x2014;would presumably not be willing to transfer its net assets to the control of another&#x2014;the acquirer&#x2014;in exchange for nothing of value.</p></body></paragraph>
