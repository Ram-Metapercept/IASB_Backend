Many respondents who commented on the proposed definition said that it would exclude certain transactions covered by APB Opinion No. 16 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Business Combinations</ph></ph> (APB Opinion 16), in particular, transactions in which none of the former shareholder groups of the combining entities obtained control over the combined entity (such as roll&#x2011;ups, put&#x2011;togethers and so&#x2011;called mergers of equals). During its redeliberations of the 1999 Exposure Draft, the FASB concluded that those transactions should be included in the definition of a business combination and in the scope of SFAS 141. Therefore, paragraph 10 of SFAS 141 indicated that it also applied to business combinations in which none of the owners of the combining entities as a group retain or receive a majority of the voting rights of the combined entity. However, the FASB acknowledged at that time that some of those business combinations might not be acquisitions and said that it intended to consider in another project whether business combinations that are not acquisitions should be accounted for using the fresh start method rather than the purchase method.</p></body></paragraph>
