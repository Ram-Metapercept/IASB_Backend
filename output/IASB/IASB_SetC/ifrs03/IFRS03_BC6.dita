It did not do so because that definition excluded some forms of combinations encompassed in IAS 22 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Business Combinations</ph></ph> (which IFRS 3 replaced), such as those described in <xref id="IFRS03_X1234" base="F16122110" href="IFRS03_BC5.dita#IFRS03_BC5">paragraph BC5</xref> in which none of the former shareholder groups of the combining entities obtained control over the combined entity. Accordingly, IFRS 3 essentially retained the definition of a business combination from IAS 22.</p></body></paragraph>
