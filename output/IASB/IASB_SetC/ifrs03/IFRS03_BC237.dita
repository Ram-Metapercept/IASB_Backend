Unlike liabilities, it could not require assets to be measured at the lower of their acquisition&#x2011;date fair values or <i>the amounts that would be recognised if applying</i> SFAS 5. Because SFAS 5 does not allow recognition of gain contingencies, the amount that would be recognised by applying SFAS 5 to an asset would be zero. Thus, the FASB decided that an asset arising from a contingency should be measured at the lower of its acquisition&#x2011;date fair value or <i>the best estimate of its future settlement amount</i>. The FASB believes that that measure is similar to the measure required by SFAS 5 for liabilities (loss contingencies). The FASB also observed that the approach for assets allows for the recognition of impairments to the asset; it requires an asset to be decreased to the current estimate of the amount the acquirer expects to collect.</p></body></paragraph>
