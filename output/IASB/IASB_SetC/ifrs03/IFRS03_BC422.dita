The disclosure is required only from public business entities for the current year, the current interim period and cumulative interim periods from the acquisition date to the end of the current year. IFRS 3 already required disclosure of the amount of the acquiree&#x2019;s profit or loss included in the acquirer&#x2019;s profit or loss for the period, unless that was impracticable; the IASB added revenues to that disclosure.

The disclosure is required only from public entities and only if practicable. The IASB decided not to add that disclosure.

SFAS 141(R) no longer permits the alternative practice of reporting revenues and expenses of the acquiree as if the acquisition occurred as of the beginning of the year (or a designated date) with a reduction to eliminate the acquiree&#x2019;s pre&#x2011;acquisition period earnings.
