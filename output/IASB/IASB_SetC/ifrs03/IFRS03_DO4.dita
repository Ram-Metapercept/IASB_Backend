Second, Professor Barth and Mr Smith believe that the benefits of consistently measuring all assets acquired and liabilities assumed outweigh the costs involved in conducting the measurement. To address concerns about costs exceeding benefits in particular acquisitions, they would have supported an exception to the principle based on undue cost or effort. Such an exception would not have been a free choice, but would have required assessment of the facts and circumstances associated with the acquisition. Professor Barth and Mr Smith disagree with the Board&#x2019;s decision to permit a free choice, rather than to adopt such an exception. They also disagree with the Board&#x2019;s decision not to require fair value measurement even for acquisitions of listed acquirees, for which the cost would be nil. Third, a consequence of failure to measure non&#x2011;controlling interests at fair value is that acquired goodwill is not measured at fair value. In addition to being an exception to the IFRS&#x2019;s measurement principle, this has several undesirable effects beyond the initial accounting for goodwill. The Board acknowledges these in <xref id="IFRS03_X1597" base="F16383273" href="IFRS03_BC217.dita#IFRS03_BC217">paragraphs BC217 and BC218</xref>. In particular, if goodwill is impaired the impairment loss is understated, and if the acquirer subsequently purchases more of the non&#x2011;controlling interests equity is reduced more than it would be had goodwill been measured initially at fair value. Fourth, based on staff research, the choice will benefit only a minority of acquirers because most acquisitions are for 100 per cent of the acquiree. As noted above, any benefit is reduced if such acquirers subsequently impair goodwill or acquire more of the non&#x2011;controlling interest because of the resulting anomalous accounting results.</p></body></paragraph>
