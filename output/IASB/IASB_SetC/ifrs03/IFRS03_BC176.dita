Instead, SFAS 141 precluded separate recognition of an assembled workforce because of the FASB&#x2019;s conclusion that techniques to measure the value of an assembled workforce with sufficient reliability were not currently available. IFRS 3 and <xref id="IFRS03_X1335" base="F16122457" href="../ias38/IAS38_TOC0001.dita#IAS38_TOC0001">IAS 38</xref>, on the other hand, did not explicitly preclude separate recognition of an assembled workforce. However, <xref id="IFRS03_X1336" base="F16122459" href="../ias38/IAS38_15.dita#IAS38_15">paragraph 15 of IAS 38</xref> noted that an entity would not usually have sufficient control over the expected future economic benefits arising from an assembled workforce for it to meet the definition of a separate intangible asset.</p></body></paragraph>
