That is a consequence of entering into contingent consideration arrangements related to future changes in the value of a specified asset or liability or earnings of the acquiree after the acquisition date. For example, if a contingent consideration arrangement relates to the level of future earnings of the combined entity, higher earnings in the specified periods may be partially offset by increases in the liability to make contingent payments based on earnings because the acquirer has agreed to share those increases with former owners of the acquiree.</p></body></paragraph>
