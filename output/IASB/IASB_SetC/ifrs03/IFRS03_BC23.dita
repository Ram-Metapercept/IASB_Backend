In assessing those methods, both boards were mindful of the disadvantages of having more than one method of accounting for business combinations, as evidenced by the experience with IAS 22 and APB Opinion 16. The boards concluded that having more than one method could be justified only if the alternative method (or methods) could be demonstrated to produce information that is more decision&#x2011;useful and if unambiguous and non&#x2011;arbitrary boundaries could be established that unequivocally distinguish when one method is to be applied instead of another. The boards also concluded that most business combinations are acquisitions and, for the reasons discussed in <xref id="IFRS03_X1249" base="F16122149" href="IFRS03_gBC24-BC28.dita#IFRS03_gBC24-BC28">paragraphs BC24&#x2013;BC28</xref>, that the acquisition method is the appropriate method for those business combinations. Respondents to ED 3 and the 1999 Exposure Draft generally agreed. Therefore, neither the pooling method nor the fresh start method could be appropriately used for all business combinations.</p></body></paragraph>
