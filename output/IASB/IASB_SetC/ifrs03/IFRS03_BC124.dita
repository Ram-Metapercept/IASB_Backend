Although those factors are neither mutually exclusive nor individually conclusive, the boards decided that the factors could help in considering whether a transaction or event is arranged primarily for the economic benefit of the acquirer or the combined entity or primarily for the benefit of the acquiree and its former owners before the business combination.</p></body></paragraph>
