The primary reason for those changes is the boards&#x2019; decision to focus on measuring the components of the business combination, including any non&#x2011;controlling interest in the acquiree, rather than measuring the fair value of the acquiree as a whole. The boards observed that neither the requirements of the 2005 Exposure Draft nor those of the revised standards for applying the acquisition method result in a fair value measure of either the acquiree as a whole or the acquirer&#x2019;s interest in the acquiree. For example, the revised standards do not provide for recognising a loss if the acquirer overpays for the acquiree, ie if the acquisition&#x2011;date fair value of the consideration transferred exceeds the acquisition&#x2011;date fair value of the acquirer&#x2019;s interest in the acquiree. The IASB&#x2019;s decision to allow an acquirer to choose to measure any non&#x2011;controlling interest in the acquiree at fair value or on the basis of its proportionate interest in the acquiree&#x2019;s identifiable net assets adds another potential difference between the results of applying the requirements of the revised IFRS 3 and measuring the acquisition&#x2011;date fair value of the acquiree as a whole.
