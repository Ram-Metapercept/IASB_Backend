<paragraph id="IFRS03_BC114" base="F4231925" principles="no"><paranum>BC114</paranum><prolog><data name="standard_number" value="IFRS 3"/><data name="paranum" value="BC114"/></prolog><body><p id="IFRS03_P2240">The boards observed that in accordance with both IFRS 3 and SFAS 141, and their predecessors and the related interpretative guidance, particular items were recognised <b>as if</b> they were assets acquired or liabilities assumed at the acquisition date even though they did not meet the definition of an asset or a liability. That practice was related to the previous emphasis on measuring the cost of (or investment in) the acquiree rather than the acquisition&#x2011;date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For example, as discussed in <xref id="IFRS03_X1293" base="F16122298" href="IFRS03_BC365.dita#IFRS03_BC365">paragraphs BC365&#x2013;BC370</xref>, some expenses for services received in connection with a business combination were capitalised as part of the cost of the acquiree (and recognised as part of goodwill) <b>as if</b> they were an asset at the acquisition date. In addition, some future costs that an acquirer expected to incur often were viewed as a cost of the acquiree and recognised <b>as if</b> they were a liability at the acquisition date&#x2014;expected restructuring costs were an example. The boards concluded that the representational faithfulness, consistency and understandability of financial reporting would be improved by eliminating such practices.</p></body></paragraph>
