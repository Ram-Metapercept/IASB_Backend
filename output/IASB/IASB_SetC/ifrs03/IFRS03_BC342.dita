However, they also observed that the parties to a business combination are likely to take into account expected changes between the agreement date and the acquisition date in the fair value of the acquirer and the market price of the acquirer&#x2019;s securities issued as consideration. The argument against acquisition date measurement of equity securities noted in <xref id="IFRS03_X1450" base="F16122903" href="IFRS03_BC341.dita#IFRS03_BC341">paragraph BC341(a)</xref> is mitigated if acquirers and targets generally consider their best estimates at the agreement date of the fair values of the amounts to be exchanged on the acquisition dates. The boards also noted that measuring the equity securities on the acquisition date avoids the complexities of dealing with situations in which the number of shares or other consideration transferred can change between the agreement date and the acquisition date. The boards therefore concluded that equity instruments issued as consideration in a business combination should be measured at their fair values on the acquisition date. </p></body></paragraph>
