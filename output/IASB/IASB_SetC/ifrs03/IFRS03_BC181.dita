Examples of such rights include a right to use the acquirer&#x2019;s trade name under a franchise agreement or a right to use the acquirer&#x2019;s technology under a technology licensing agreement. The 2005 Exposure Draft proposed, and the revised standards require, an acquirer to recognise such a reacquired right as an identifiable intangible asset (<xref id="IFRS03_X1339" base="F16122491" href="IFRS03_B35.dita#IFRS03_B35">paragraph B35</xref> of the revised IFRS 3). The fair value of a reacquired right is to be amortised over the remaining term of the contract that gave rise to the right. For entities applying US GAAP, that guidance is not new; it is the same as the related guidance in EITF Issue 04&#x2011;1. (Paragraphs BC308&#x2013;BC310 discuss the measurement of reacquired rights.)</p></body></paragraph>
