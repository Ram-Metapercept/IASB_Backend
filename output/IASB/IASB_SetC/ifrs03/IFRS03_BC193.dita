For example, for most short&#x2011;duration contracts such as property and liability insurance contracts, US GAAP claims liabilities are not discounted, so amortising the intangible asset like a discount using an interest method could be an appropriate method. For particular long&#x2011;duration contracts such as most traditional life insurance contracts, using a basis consistent with the measurement of the liability would be similar to the guidance provided in paragraph 31 of FASB Statement No. 60 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises</ph></ph> (SFAS 60).</p></body></paragraph>
