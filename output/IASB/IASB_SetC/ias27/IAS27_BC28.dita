IAS 27 (as amended in 2008) had previously required the disclosure of the country of incorporation or residence of such entities. The clarification of the disclosure requirement is more consistent with those requirements in other IFRSs (eg <xref base="F16161549" href="../ifrs12/IFRS12_TOC.dita#IFRS12_TOC0001" id="IAS27_X0266">IFRS 12</xref> and <xref base="F16161550" href="../ias01/IAS01_TOC.dita#IAS01_TOC0001" id="IAS27_X0267">IAS 1 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Presentation of Financial Statements</ph></ph></xref>) that also require disclosure of the principal place of business and country of incorporation.</p></body></paragraph>
