This required an entity to recognise distributions as income only if they came from post&#x2011;acquisition retained earnings. Distributions received in excess of such retained earnings were regarded as a recovery of investment and were recognised as a reduction in the cost of the investment. To apply that method retrospectively upon first&#x2011;time adoption of IFRSs in its separate financial statements, an investor would need to know the subsidiary&#x2019;s pre&#x2011;acquisition retained earnings in accordance with IFRSs.</p></body></paragraph>
