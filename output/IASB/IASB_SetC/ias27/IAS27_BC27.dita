Accordingly, <xref id="IAS27_X0264" base="F16161547" href="IAS27_13.dita#IAS27_13">paragraphs 13 and 14</xref> apply only when the criteria in those paragraphs are satisfied. Therefore, the Board expects that entities would continue to account for transactions that do not satisfy the criteria in <xref id="IAS27_X0265" base="F16161548" href="IAS27_13.dita#IAS27_13">paragraphs 13 and 14</xref> in accordance with their accounting policies for such transactions. The Board plans to consider the definition of common control and the accounting for business combinations under common control in a future project on common control transactions.</p></body></paragraph>
