In addition, the owners of the original parent have the same relative and absolute interests in the net assets of the new group immediately after the reorganisation as they had in the net assets of the original group before the reorganisation. Finally, this type of reorganisation involves an existing entity and its shareholders agreeing to create a new parent between them. In contrast, many transactions or events that result in a parent&#x2011;subsidiary relationship are initiated by a parent over an entity that will be positioned below it in the structure of the group.</p></body></paragraph>
