The Board is or will be discussing related issues in the reporting entity phase of its <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> project and in its project on common control transactions. Accordingly, these Board members believe that the Board should have permitted a new parent to measure the cost of its investment in the original parent either at the carrying amount of its share of the equity items shown in the separate financial statements of the original parent or at the fair value of the equity instruments that it issues until the Board discusses the related issues in its projects on reporting entity and common control transactions.</p></body></paragraph>
