<paragraph id="IAS27_BC10D" base="F37046977"><paranum>BC10D</paranum><prolog><data name="standard_number" value="IAS 27"/><data name="paranum" value="BC10D"/></prolog><body><p id="IAS27_P0344">The Board noted that the financial statements of an investor that has no investments in subsidiaries, and has investments in associates or joint ventures that are required by IAS 28 to be accounted for using the equity method, are not separate financial statements. Consequently, in those financial statements, such an investor is required to comply with the disclosure requirements in IFRS 12. As a logical consequence, such an investor is less likely to prepare separate financial statements in which investments in associates or joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. If such an investor presents separate financial statements, the Board expects that the investor is likely to account for its investments in associates or joint ventures either at cost or in accordance with IFRS 9.</p></body></paragraph>
