Respondents generally supported the proposed amendments to IAS 27, except for the proposal to require impairment testing of the related investment when an investor recognises a dividend. In the light of the comments received, the Board revised its proposal and identified specific indicators of impairment. This was done to narrow the circumstances in which impairment testing of the related investment would be required when an investor recognises a dividend (see <xref id="IAS27_X0259" base="F16161365" href="../ias36/IAS36_12.dita#IAS36_12">paragraph 12(h) of IAS 36</xref>). The Board included the amendments in <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate</ph></ph> issued in May 2008.</p></body></paragraph>
