The concept &#x2018;retired from active use&#x2019; would have been simple to apply and management intentions would be removed from the Standard. The classification would equally apply to any form of disposal (sale, abandonment, exchange, spin&#x2011;off etc); no detailed (anti&#x2011;abuse) rules and no illustrations would be necessary and the Standard would be simple and based on a clear and unambiguous principle. Mr Schmid, on this point, does not agree with the conclusions in <xref id="IFRS05_X0516" base="F15830954" href="IFRS05_BC18.dita#IFRS05_BC18">paragraph BC18</xref> that a classification &#x2018;retired from active use&#x2019; would not require fewer criteria to support it than the category &#x2018;assets held for sale&#x2019;.</p></body></paragraph>
