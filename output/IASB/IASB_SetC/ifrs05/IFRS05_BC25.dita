They are regarded as disposed of only when exchanged. The Basis for Conclusions on SFAS 144 explains that this is because the exchange of such assets is accounted for at amounts based on the carrying amount of the assets, not at fair value, and that using the carrying amount is more consistent with the accounting for a long&#x2011;lived asset to be held and used than for a long&#x2011;lived asset to be sold.</p></body></paragraph>
