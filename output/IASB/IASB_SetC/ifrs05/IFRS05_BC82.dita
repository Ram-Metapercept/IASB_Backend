SFAS 144 defines fair value of an asset as &#x2018;the amount at which that asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties, that is, other than in a forced or liquidation sale&#x2019;, and costs to sell as &#x2018;the incremental direct costs to transact a sale, that is, the costs that result directly from and are essential to a sale transaction and that would not have been incurred by the entity had the decision to sell not been made.&#x2019; <xref id="IFRS05_X0502" base="F15830674" href="../ias36/IAS36_TOC0001.dita#IAS36_TOC0001">IAS 36</xref> defines net selling price as the amount obtainable from the sale of an asset in an arm&#x2019;s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, less the costs of disposal. Costs of disposal are incremental costs directly attributable to the disposal of an asset, excluding finance costs and income tax expenses.</p></body></paragraph>
