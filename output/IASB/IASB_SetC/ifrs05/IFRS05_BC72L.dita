This is because this requirement is consistent with the transition requirements provided by IFRIC 17 when it amended IFRS 5 (see paragraph 44D of IFRS 5). The Board considered that prospective application is also required to avoid the potential use of hindsight, because an entity might not have collected all the relevant information at the time of the change in the plan to allow the entity to account for this change.</p></body></paragraph>
