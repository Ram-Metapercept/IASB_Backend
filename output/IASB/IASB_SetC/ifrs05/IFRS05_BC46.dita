SFAS 144 requires the recognition of a subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell, but not in excess of the cumulative loss previously recognised for a write&#x2011;down to fair value less costs to sell. The Board decided that, under IFRSs, a gain should be recognised to the extent that it reverses any impairment of the asset, either in accordance with the IFRS or previously in accordance with <xref id="IFRS05_X0445" base="F15830426" href="../ias36/IAS36_TOC0001.dita#IAS36_TOC0001">IAS 36</xref>.  Recognising a gain for the reversal of an impairment that occurred before the classification of the asset as held for sale is consistent with the requirement in <xref id="IFRS05_X0447" base="F15830427" href="../ias36/IAS36_TOC0001.dita#IAS36_TOC0001">IAS 36</xref> to recognise reversals of impairment.</p></body></paragraph>
