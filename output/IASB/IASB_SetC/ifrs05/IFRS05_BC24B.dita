Loss of control is a significant economic event that changes the nature of an investment. The parent&#x2011;subsidiary relationship ceases to exist and an investor&#x2011;investee relationship begins that differs significantly from the former parent&#x2011;subsidiary relationship. Therefore, the new investor&#x2011;investee relationship is recognised and measured initially at the date when control is lost.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
