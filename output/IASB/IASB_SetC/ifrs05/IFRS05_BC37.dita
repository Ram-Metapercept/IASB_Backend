The question arises whether classification as held for sale should trigger the recycling of any exchange differences. Under US GAAP (EITF 01&#x2011;5 <i>Application of FASB Statement No. 52 to an Investment Being Evaluated for Impairment That Will Be Disposed Of</i>) the accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments previously recognised in other comprehensive income that are expected to be recycled in income at the time of sale are included in the carrying amount of the asset (or disposal group) being tested for impairment.</p></body></paragraph>
