Some commentators suggested that the categorisation &#x2018;assets held for sale&#x2019; is unnecessary, and that if the focus were changed to &#x2018;assets <i>retired</i> from active use&#x2019; much of the complexity could be eliminated, because the latter classification would be based on actuality rather than what they perceive as management intent. They assert that it is the potential abuse of the classification that necessitates many of the detailed requirements in SFAS 144. Others suggested that, if existing IFRSs were amended to specify that assets retired from active use are measured at fair value less costs to sell and to require additional disclosure, some convergence with SFAS 144 could be achieved without creating a new IFRS.</p></body></paragraph>
