The Board concluded that it would be simplest to require the same allocation as is required by <xref id="IFRS05_X0441" base="F15830433" href="../ias36/IAS36_TOC0001.dita#IAS36_TOC0001">IAS 36</xref> for cash&#x2011;generating units.  Although this is different from SFAS 144, the disposal group as a whole will be measured at the same amount.</p></body></paragraph>
