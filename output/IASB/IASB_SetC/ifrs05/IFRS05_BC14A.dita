Some believed that IFRS 5 and other IFRSs that specifically refer to non&#x2011;current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale or discontinued operations set out all the disclosures required in respect of those assets or operations. Others believed that all disclosures required by IFRSs whose scope does not specifically exclude non&#x2011;current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale or discontinued operations apply to such assets (or disposal groups).<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS05_FN0030" type="fn"/></p></body></paragraph>
