Assets to be abandoned are classified as held and used until disposed of, and thus are depreciated. The Board agrees with the FASB&#x2019;s observation that a distinction can be drawn between an asset that is to be sold and an asset that is to be abandoned, because the former will be recovered principally through sale and the latter through its continuing use. Therefore, it is logical that depreciation should cease in the former but not the latter case.</p></body></paragraph>
