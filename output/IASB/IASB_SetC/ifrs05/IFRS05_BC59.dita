A component is widely drawn, the criterion being that it comprises &#x2018;operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest of the entity&#x2019;. SFAS 144 states that a component may be a segment, a reporting unit, a subsidiary or an asset group.</p></body></paragraph>
