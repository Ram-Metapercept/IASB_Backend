The Board considered the issues raised and decided that assets that were already carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss should not be subject to the measurement requirements of the IFRS.  The Board believes that, for such assets, continued measurement at fair value gives better information than measurement at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The Board did not, however, believe that such treatment was appropriate for assets that had been revalued in accordance with <xref base="F15830315" href="../ias16/IAS16_TOC.dita#IAS16_TOC0001" id="IFRS05_X0450">IAS 16</xref> and <xref base="F15830317" href="../ias38/IAS38_TOC0001.dita#IAS38_TOC0001" id="IFRS05_X0451">IAS 38</xref>, because those standards require depreciation to continue and the revaluation change would not necessarily be recognised in profit or loss. The Board concluded that assets that had been revalued in accordance with <xref base="F15830316" href="../ias16/IAS16_TOC.dita#IAS16_TOC0001" id="IFRS05_X0452">IAS 16</xref> and <xref base="F15830318" href="../ias38/IAS38_TOC0001.dita#IAS38_TOC0001" id="IFRS05_X0453">IAS 38</xref> should be treated in the same way as any assets that, before classification as held for sale, had not been revalued. Such an approach results in a consistent treatment for assets that are within the scope of the measurement requirements of the IFRS and, hence, a simpler standard.</p></body></paragraph>
