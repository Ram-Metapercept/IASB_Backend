The Board concluded that it is sufficient to show a single net figure for discontinued operations on the face of the income statement because of the limited future cash flows expected to arise from the operations. The IFRS therefore permits an analysis of the single net amount to be presented either in the notes or in the income statement.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS05_FN0045" type="fn"/> </p></body></paragraph>
