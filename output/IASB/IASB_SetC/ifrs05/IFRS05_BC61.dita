The trigger in IAS 35 for classifying the operation as discontinuing is the earlier of (a) the entity entering into a binding sale agreement and (b) the board of directors approving and announcing a formal disposal plan. Although IAS 35 refers to <xref base="F15830195" href="../ias37/IAS37_TOC.dita#IAS37_TOC0001" id="IFRS05_X0472">IAS 37</xref> for further guidance on what constitutes a plan, the criteria are less restrictive than those in SFAS 144.</p></body></paragraph>
