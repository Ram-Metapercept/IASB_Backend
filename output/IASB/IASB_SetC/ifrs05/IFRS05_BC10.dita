The Board decided to clarify in IFRS 5 that assets classified as non&#x2011;current are not reclassified as current assets until they meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale in accordance with the IFRS.  Further, assets of a class that an entity would normally regard as non&#x2011;current and are acquired exclusively with a view to resale are not classified as current unless they meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale in accordance with the IFRS. </p></body></paragraph>
