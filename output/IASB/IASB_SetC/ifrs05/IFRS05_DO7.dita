(Most of these problems seem to be with the guidance concerning the definition in SFAS 144, rather than the definition itself.) In <xref id="IFRS05_X0515" base="F15830953" href="IFRS05_BC71.dita#IFRS05_BC71">paragraph BC71</xref>, the Board describes its action as an interim measure, and plans to work with the FASB to arrive promptly at a converged solution. In Mr Cope&#x2019;s view, it would have been much preferable to have converged first, and then dealt with any implementation problems jointly with the FASB.</p></body></paragraph>
