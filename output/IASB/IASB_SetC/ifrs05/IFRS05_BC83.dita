However, it noted that &#x2018;fair value&#x2019; is used in many IFRSs. The Board concluded that it would be preferable to use the same phrase as SFAS 144 so that it is clear that convergence on this point had been achieved and to amend IAS 36 so that the terminology in IAS 36 is consistent with other IFRSs. Therefore, a consequential amendment made by IFRS 5 replaces &#x2018;net selling price&#x2019; with &#x2018;fair value less costs to sell&#x2019; throughout <xref id="IFRS05_X0503" base="F15830677" href="../ias36/IAS36_TOC0001.dita#IAS36_TOC0001">IAS 36</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
