However, the Board does not agree with that view. Rather, the Board believes that the internally generated goodwill provides a buffer against the recognition of an impairment loss on the disposal group. The same effect arises from the impairment requirements in <xref id="IFRS05_X0434" base="F15830473" href="../ias36/IAS36_TOC0001.dita#IAS36_TOC0001">IAS 36</xref>. The non&#x2011;depreciation of the non&#x2011;current assets in the disposal group is, as with individual assets, a consequence of the basic principle underlying the separate classification, that the carrying amount of the asset will be recovered principally through sale, not continuing use, and that amounts recovered through continuing use will be incidental.</p></body></paragraph>
