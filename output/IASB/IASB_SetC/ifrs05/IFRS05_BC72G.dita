Instead, it should be treated as a continuation of the original plan. This means that an entity moves from one method of disposal to the other without any time lag, so that there is no interruption of the application of the requirements in IFRS 5. This would involve applying the classification, presentation and measurement requirements required for each type of disposal in IFRS 5.</p></body></paragraph>
