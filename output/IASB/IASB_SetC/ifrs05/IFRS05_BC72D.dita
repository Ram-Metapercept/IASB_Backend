However, this amendment did not provide guidance for when an entity reclassifies an asset (or disposal group) from held for sale to held for distribution to owners (or vice versa), or when held-for-distribution accounting is discontinued. The Board noted that paragraphs 27&#x2013;29 of IFRS 5 should have been considered for amendment by IFRIC 17 and the fact that they were not amended at the time was an oversight.</p></body></paragraph>
