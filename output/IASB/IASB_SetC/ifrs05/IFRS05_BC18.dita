Some might argue that the criteria are too specific. However, the Board believes that the criteria should be specific to achieve comparability of classification between entities. The Board does not believe that a classification &#x2018;retired from active use&#x2019; would necessarily require fewer criteria to support it. For example, it would be necessary to establish a distinction between assets retired from active use and those that are held as back&#x2011;up spares or are temporarily idle.</p></body></paragraph>
