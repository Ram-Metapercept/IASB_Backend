The Board concluded that to be consistent with the principle of SFAS 144 and also to be consistent with the requirements of <xref id="IFRS05_X0455" base="F15830376" href="../ias36/IAS36_TOC0001.dita#IAS36_TOC0001">IAS 36</xref>, an asset that ceases to be classified as held for sale should be measured at the lower of (a) the carrying amount that would have been recognised had the asset not been classified as held for sale and (b) its recoverable amount at the date of reclassification. Whilst this is not full convergence, the difference arises from differences in the US GAAP and IFRS impairment models.</p></body></paragraph>
