The Committee noted that <xref base="F59117583" href="../ifrs03/IFRS03_TOC.dita#IFRS03_TOC0001/IFRS03_TOC0001_V2" id="IFRIC23_X0101"><ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 3</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Business Combinations</ph></ph></xref> applies to all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.
