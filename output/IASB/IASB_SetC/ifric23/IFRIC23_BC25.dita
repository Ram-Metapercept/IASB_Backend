Consequently, the Committee decided not to require the restatement of comparative information when an entity first applies the Interpretation. However, the Committee concluded that an entity should not be prevented from applying the Interpretation retrospectively if it is able to do so without the use of hindsight. Consequently, the Committee decided to permit retrospective application if that is possible without the use of hindsight.</p></body></paragraph>
