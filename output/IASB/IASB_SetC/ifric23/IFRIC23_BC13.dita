Almost all respondents to the draft Interpretation supported the examination assumption. The Committee also noted that the assumption of examination by the taxation authority, in isolation, would not require an entity to reflect the effects of uncertainty. The threshold for reflecting the effects of uncertainty is whether it is probable that the taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment. In other words, the recognition of uncertainty is not determined based on whether a taxation authority examines a tax treatment.</p></body></paragraph>
