For example, the timing of deductibility of the cost of an intangible asset under tax law may be uncertain and this may affect both taxable profit and the tax base of the asset, which in turn affects the determination of current and deferred tax respectively. The Committee decided to require a consistent approach to reflecting the effect of uncertainty for both current and deferred tax; therefore, the Interpretation applies in determining both current and deferred tax.</p></body></paragraph>
