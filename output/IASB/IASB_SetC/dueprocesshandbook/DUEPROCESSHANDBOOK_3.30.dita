Such         changes are permitted as long as the technical decisions are unaffected. The technical staff         reports to the Board or the Interpretations Committee after the ballot or prepares and         circulates to the Board or the Interpretations Committee a post-ballot draft showing the         final changes.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
