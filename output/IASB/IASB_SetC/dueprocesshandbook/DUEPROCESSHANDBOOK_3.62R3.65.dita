Papers discussed by the consultative group are made         publicly available. Meetings are recorded and, when possible, webcast live. Recordings of         meetings are made available on the IFRS Foundation website. If the Board were to decide that         a particular meeting of a consultative group should be private, a summary of each such         meeting would usually be posted on the relevant project page.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
