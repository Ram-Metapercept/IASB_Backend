In addition, it           shares information with and consults international and regional bodies such as the           International Forum of Accounting Standard Setters, the Asian-Oceanian Standard-Setters Group,           the Group of Latin American Standard Setters, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group           and the Pan African Federation of Accountants as well as jurisdictional (national)           standard-setters. Board members meet with representatives of these regional and national           bodies. Close co-ordination between the Board&#x2019;s due process and the due process of other           accounting standard-setters is important to achieving the Board&#x2019;s objectives.</p>       </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
