Because of their nature, it is not necessary         to undertake consultation or outreach for annual improvements beyond the comment letter         process. The Board needs to be cautious and avoid including in the annual improvements         package an amendment that merits separate consultation and outreach.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
