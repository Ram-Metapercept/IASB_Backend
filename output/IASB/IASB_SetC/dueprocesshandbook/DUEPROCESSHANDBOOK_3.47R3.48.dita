These         additional steps could include surveys, private meetings, webcasts and meetings with         representative groups, such as the Capital Markets Advisory Committee. Feedback from this         consultation with investors is summarised in a staff paper and is considered and assessed         along with comment letters. The reporting of this feedback is as transparent as possible,         while respecting requests for confidentiality.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
