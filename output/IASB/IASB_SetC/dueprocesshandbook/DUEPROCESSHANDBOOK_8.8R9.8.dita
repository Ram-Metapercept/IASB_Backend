As stated in <xref href="DUEPROCESSHANDBOOK_8.5R9.5.dita" scope="local">paragraph 9.5</xref>, a breach of due process does not invalidate a pronouncement issued by the Board. Accordingly, if the matter relates to a Standard, an amendment to a Standard or an IFRIC Interpretation that has been issued by the Board, that pronouncement shall remain valid in all respects until the due process complaint has been addressed by the DPOC or the Trustees. In such cases the DPOC or the Trustees should address the complaint as expeditiously as possible, taking into consideration the effective date of the pronouncement.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
