In the event         of a tied vote on a decision to be made by a simple majority of the members present at a         meeting in person or by telecommunications, the Chair has an additional casting vote. The         technical staff will need to determine whether any Board members who disagree with a         tentative decision might dissent from the whole proposal because of that decision.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
