This report is posted on the IFRS Foundation website and is then considered by         the DPOC at one of its meetings at which the Chair and/or the Vice-Chair of the Board are         present. The DPOC may request additional information from the Trustee staff member before         finalising a response. The response of the DPOC, usually in the form of a letter to the         complainant, is also posted on the IFRS Foundation website.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
