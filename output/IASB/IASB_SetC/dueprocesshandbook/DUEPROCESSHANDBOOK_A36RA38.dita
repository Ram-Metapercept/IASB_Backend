The technical staff assesses the necessity of any planned changes and develop any such required changes in consultation with the ITCG while also conducting targeted outreach, for example with regulators and software vendors. When the changes are expected to be substantial or alternative options exist, it may be appropriate to issue a request for information before finalising a proposal to change the IFRS Taxonomy.</p>   </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
