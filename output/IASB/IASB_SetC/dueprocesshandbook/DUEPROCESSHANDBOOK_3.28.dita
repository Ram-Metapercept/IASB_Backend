As part of the balloting process the technical staff liaises with the         IFRS Foundation Translations and IFRS Taxonomy staff to ensure that the proposed document         can be translated into other languages and incorporated easily into the IFRS Taxonomy. All         documents undergo editorial review.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
