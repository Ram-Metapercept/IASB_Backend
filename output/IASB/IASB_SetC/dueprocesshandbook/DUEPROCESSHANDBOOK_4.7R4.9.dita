This analysis will help the Board decide whether it         should undertake a standard-setting project to develop a proposal for a new IFRS Standard or         to amend or replace a Standard. The research programme might also include the consideration         of broader financial reporting matters, such as how financial reporting is evolving, to         encourage international debate on financial reporting matters.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
