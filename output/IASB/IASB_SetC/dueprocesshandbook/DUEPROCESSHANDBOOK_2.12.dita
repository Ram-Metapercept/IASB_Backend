The         conclusions of that review and evaluation, including whether due process concerns are         identified or not, are included in the reports referred to in paragraph 2.15(d). Before any         new or amended IFRS Standard is finalised, the DPOC will confirm that it has completed its         review of the due process. In reaching its decisions, the DPOC operates on a simple majority         basis.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
