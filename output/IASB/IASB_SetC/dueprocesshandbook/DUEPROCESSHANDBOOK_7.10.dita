If four or more Board         members object to the release of the draft Interpretation during the balloting process, the         draft Interpretation is not released. If a draft Interpretation is not released because of         Board members&#x2019; objections, the Board decides whether the draft Interpretation should be         published with amendments, whether the matter should be referred back to the Interpretations         Committee or considered further by the Board, or if there should be no further action.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
