These might include publishing educational materials, such as articles and webcasts (see         paragraphs 8.8&#x2013;8.10). Board members and technical staff may also hold meetings with         interested parties, including other standard-setting bodies, to help understand unexpected         matters that have arisen from the implementation of the Standard and the potential effect of         its requirements.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
