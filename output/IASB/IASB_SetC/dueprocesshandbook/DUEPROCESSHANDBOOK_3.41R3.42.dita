This consultation can be carried out through various means including, but not         limited to, invitations to comment, individual meetings or fieldwork. Some consultation         procedures are mandatory. Other procedures are not mandatory but are considered by the Board         and, if it is decided that the process is not necessary, the Board gives the DPOC its         reasons for not taking that step.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
