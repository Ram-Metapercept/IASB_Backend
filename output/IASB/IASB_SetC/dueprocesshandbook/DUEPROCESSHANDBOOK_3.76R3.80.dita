The Board has regard to the effects on financial stability when assessing the effects of new         financial reporting requirements to the extent appropriate and when relevant. For example,         in explaining to a broad stakeholder audience the expected benefits of a new Standard, the         Board may consider it useful to explain the link between increased transparency in financial         reporting and a potential positive effect on financial stability. The introduction by an         IFRS Standard of a current value measurement basis could, for instance, be a circumstance in         which the Board concludes such explanation is appropriate and relevant. In addition, while         it is generally impossible to quantitively assess the possible broader economic consequences         of new financial reporting requirements, the Board may assess specific economic effects when         relevant. The Board is not required to make a formal quantitative assessment of the overall         effect of a new or amended IFRS Standard. Initial and ongoing costs and benefits are likely         to affect different parties in different ways.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
