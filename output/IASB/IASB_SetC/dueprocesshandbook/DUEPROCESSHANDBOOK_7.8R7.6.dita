It considers the principles established in the relevant IFRS Standards         to develop an interpretation and to determine that the interpretation does not change or         conflict with the Standards. If the Interpretations Committee concludes that the         requirements of a Standard differ from the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph>, it obtains direction from         the Board. In developing IFRIC Interpretations, the Interpretations Committee is not seeking         to create an extensive rule-oriented environment, nor does it act as an urgent issues         group.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
