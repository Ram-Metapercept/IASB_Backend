In all cases the documents will state clearly whether the         material is an integral part of the Standard or whether it accompanies it but is not         integral. Material that is integral to a Standard is provided to governments, or the         relevant authorities, that have adopted the Standards and have an agreement with the IFRS         Foundation to receive such material.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
