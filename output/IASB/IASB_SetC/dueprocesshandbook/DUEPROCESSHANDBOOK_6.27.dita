However, the Board needs         to weigh the cost of delaying improvements to financial reporting against the relative urgency         for the need to change and what additional steps it has taken to consult since the exposure         draft was published. The use of consultative groups or targeted consultation can give the         Board information to support a decision to finalise a proposal without the need for         re-exposure.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
