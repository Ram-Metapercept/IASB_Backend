The Advisory Council also         serves as a sounding board for the Board and can be used to gather views that supplement the         normal consultative process. When the Board is considering adding a major project to the         work plan not contemplated in the previous consultation on the work plan, it consults the         Advisory Council (see paragraph 4.6). The Board also presents updates to the Advisory         Council on the work plan periodically.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
