The Board and the Interpretations Committee         will often perform steps and procedures over and above those described here because they are         continually striving to improve how they consult and operate. From time to time the Board         and the Trustees&#x2019; Due Process Oversight Committee (DPOC) (see section 2) review how the         Board and the Interpretations Committee are operating to determine whether some of these new         and additional steps should be embedded into their due process. Similarly, such reviews         could remove or amend due process steps that impede, rather than enhance, the efficient and         effective development of the Standards and material to support the consistent application of         the Standards. The DPOC seeks to ensure that the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Handbook</ph></ph> achieves a balance between timely         development of high-quality Standards and a thorough due process.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
