It is likely that some fieldwork will be undertaken on each standard-setting           project, except for minor or narrow-scope amendments. The Board and the technical staff will           need to assess which, if any, activities are appropriate and proportionate for a project,           weighing the costs of the activity and what the Board is likely to learn from the           fieldwork.</p>       </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
