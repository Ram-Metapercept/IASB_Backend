The level and format of the analysis is tailored to and reflects the       nature of the change to financial reporting and the stage of development of the new or amended       Standard. For instance, in the research phase, an analysis of the perceived financial       reporting shortcoming being addressed and the possible solutions are an integral part of the       discussion paper. In the standard-setting phase, the Board explains why it is proposing a       particular change to financial reporting requirements, including referring to the evidence it       has collected and any outreach it has undertaken, in the basis for conclusions accompanying       the exposure draft. When a major Standard is issued, the Board publishes a separate effect       analysis report that summarises the likely effects and how the Board made its assessments.       This report is included as part of the documents accompanying the Standard balloted by the       Board. For other new requirements, the Board presents its views as part of the basis for       conclusions accompanying the new requirements.</p></body></paragraph>
