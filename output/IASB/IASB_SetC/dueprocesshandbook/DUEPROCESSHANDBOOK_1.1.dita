The IFRS Foundation Trustees (Trustees) believe that, in carrying out the IFRS Foundation&#x2019;s         mission as its standard-setting body, the International Accounting Standards Board (Board)         should develop financial reporting standards that result in an entity providing useful         information about its financial position and performance in its financial statements. Those         standards should serve investors and other primary users of financial statements<xref keyref="footnotes/DUEPROCESSHANDBOOK_1.1_FN0001" type="fn"/> in making informed resource allocation and         other economic decisions. The confidence of all users of financial statements in the         transparency and integrity of those statements is critically important for the effective         functioning of capital markets, efficient capital allocation, global financial stability and         sound economic growth.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
