These materials do not constitute a proposed IFRS Taxonomy update and therefore do not need to be approved by the Board. Their aim is to facilitate the understanding of the proposed presentation and disclosure requirements. A proposed IFRS Taxonomy update is developed for the final IFRS Standard only.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
