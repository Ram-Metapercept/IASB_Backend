However, before adding a major       project to the work plan that was not contemplated in the previous consultation, the Board       consults the Advisory Council and ASAF on the potential project. The Board&#x2019;s discussion of       potential projects to be added to the work plan takes place in public Board meetings.</p></body></paragraph>
