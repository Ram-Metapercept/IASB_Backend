Research papers may also be prepared by other accounting         standard-setters or bodies, normally at the request of the Board. A research paper published         by the Board includes a clear statement of the extent of the Board&#x2019;s involvement in the         development or endorsement of that paper. In some cases, the Board will not have discussed         the paper in a public meeting and will not, therefore, have developed any views on the         matters set out in the paper.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
