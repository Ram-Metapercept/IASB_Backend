Small group meetings cannot         undermine the principle that full and open consideration of technical matters take place         during public meetings. The number of Board members attending a small group meeting is         restricted to ensure that the Board members attending could not form a potential blocking         minority for balloting (see paragraph 3.14).</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
