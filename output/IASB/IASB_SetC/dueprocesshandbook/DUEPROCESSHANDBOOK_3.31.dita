For convenience, a draft of such documents is         referred to as a <i>draft for editorial review</i>. A draft for editorial review might be         distributed to a selected group of reviewers, such as members of a consultative group, the         Interpretations Committee, other standard-setters or parties that have provided feedback on         the project. It may also be made available on the IFRS Foundation website while it is with         the selected group of reviewers.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
