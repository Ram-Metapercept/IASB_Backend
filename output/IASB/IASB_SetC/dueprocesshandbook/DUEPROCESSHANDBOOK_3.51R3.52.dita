The Board interacts with a wide range of interested parties throughout a         project, which can include practical business analysis by way of fieldwork. The Board also         liaises with the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board, which comments on         matters relating to the auditability of proposed new IFRS Standards and amendments to         Standards. Board members and technical staff also regularly hold educational sessions, attend         meetings and conferences of interested parties, invite interested organisations to voice their         views, and announce major events of the IFRS Foundation on the IFRS Foundation website.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
