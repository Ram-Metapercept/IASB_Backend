Such amendments are called &#x2018;annual improvements&#x2019;.         Annual improvements follow the same due process as other amendments to the Standards, except         that annual improvements consist of unrelated amendments that are exposed together, rather         than separately.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
