They do so by, among other things, issuing narrow-scope         amendments to the Standards, issuing IFRIC Interpretations and publishing agenda decisions         to address application questions. The Board and Interpretations Committee seek to achieve a         balance between maintaining the principle-based nature of the Standards and adding or         changing requirements in response to emerging application questions.</p></body></paragraph>
