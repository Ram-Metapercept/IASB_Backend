Before the Board asks         the technical staff to prepare a discussion paper for ballot, the Board confirms that it has         completed all of the steps necessary to ensure that the discussion paper is likely to meet         its purpose. Research papers and requests for information require the support of a simple         majority of the Board, with approval given in a public meeting.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
