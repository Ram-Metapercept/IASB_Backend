Meetings are recorded and, when         possible, webcast live. Recordings of meetings are made available on the IFRS Foundation         website. The Board and the Interpretations Committee can meet privately to discuss         administrative and other non-technical matters. Acknowledging that the boundary between         technical and non-technical matters is sometimes difficult to define, the Board and the         Interpretations Committee use their best endeavours not to undermine the principle that full         and open consideration of technical matters needs to take place during public meetings.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
