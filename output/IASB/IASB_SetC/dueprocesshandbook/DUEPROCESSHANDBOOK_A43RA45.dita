These additional steps could include, for example, private meetings with regulators and other IFRS Taxonomy users, field testing of proposed technology changes by software vendors or the setting up of a taskforce to test tag proposed content changes. Feedback from this additional consultation is considered and assessed along with public comment letters.</p>   </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
