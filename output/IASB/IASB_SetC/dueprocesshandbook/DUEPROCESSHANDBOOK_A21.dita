For other reviews, and in cases in which no editorial review of the related Standard takes place, the ITCG normally has a 14-day period in which to conduct its reviews. If the matter is considered narrow in scope or urgent, the period may be reduced, but may not be less than seven days.</p>   </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
