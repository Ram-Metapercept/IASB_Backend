Discussion papers and research papers are designed to         elicit comments from interested parties that can help the Board decide whether to add a         standard-setting project to the work plan. Discussion papers and research papers typically         include a comprehensive overview of the issues, possible approaches to addressing the         issues, the preliminary views of the Board and an <i>invitation to comment</i>.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
