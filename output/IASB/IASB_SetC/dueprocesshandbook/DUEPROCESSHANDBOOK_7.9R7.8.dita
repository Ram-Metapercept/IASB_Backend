General agreement is reached when no         more than four members have voted against the proposal. Because Interpretations are         developed on the basis of the Interpretations Committee reaching general agreement on the         particular matter, a draft Interpretation does not include any dissenting opinions. However,         the invitation to comment and the basis for conclusions identifies whether any members do         not agree with the draft Interpretation.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
