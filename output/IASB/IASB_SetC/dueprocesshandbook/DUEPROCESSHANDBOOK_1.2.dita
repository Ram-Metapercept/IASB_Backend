The Trustees and the Board have established consultative procedures with the objective of         ensuring that, in exercising its independent decision-making, the Board conducts its         standard-setting in a transparent manner, considering a wide range of views from interested         parties throughout all stages of the development of International Financial Reporting         Standards (<i>IFRS Standards</i>). (Note that when this document refers to the development         of an IFRS Standard or an amendment to an IFRS Standard, the same process also applies to         the development of an <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">IFRS             for SMEs</ph></ph> Standard or an amendment to the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">IFRS for SMEs</ph></ph> Standard.) The Board uses these         procedures to gain a better understanding of different accounting alternatives and the         potential effect of the proposals on affected parties. A comprehensive and effective due         process is essential to developing high-quality IFRS Standards that serve investors and         other primary users of financial statements.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
