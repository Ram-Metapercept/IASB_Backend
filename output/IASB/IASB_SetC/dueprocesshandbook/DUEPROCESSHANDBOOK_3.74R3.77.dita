Therefore, the Board assesses the likely effects throughout the         development of a new or amended IFRS Standard, tailoring its assessment to the stage of         development of the new or amended Standard. For example, at the research phase, the Board         focuses on assessing the nature of the financial reporting deficiency being addressed, seeks         to define the problem and proposes possible solutions, focusing particularly on the likely         benefits of developing new financial reporting requirements. At the standard-setting phase,         the Board is developing a specific proposal for a new or amended Standard. Accordingly, the         Board focuses on assessing the potential costs and benefits of implementing that proposal,         and on assessing any alternatives. The Board tailors the level of analysis to the nature of         the proposed change to financial reporting. The format of the analysis is also tailored to         the type of due process document being published. </p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
