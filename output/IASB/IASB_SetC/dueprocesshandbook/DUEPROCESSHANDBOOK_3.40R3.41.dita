For major projects, specific Board members are typically assigned to the         project as Board advisors. Board advisors provide strategic and technical advice on the         project to the technical staff. However, the recommendations made in staff papers do not         necessarily reflect the views of the Board advisors and the technical staff has ultimate         responsibility for the staff papers and their recommendations. The number of Board advisors         is restricted to ensure that the Board members so assigned could not form a potential         blocking minority for balloting (see paragraph 3.14).</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
