Sometimes a problem identified with current         financial reporting can be remedied with a relatively minor amendment to an IFRS Standard. In         other cases, the problem might require a more significant change to financial reporting         requirements, such as a major change to a Standard or the development of a new Standard.         Consequently, the first step in developing a new financial reporting requirement is to assess         and define the problem within the existing reporting practice. For how the Board assesses the         likely effects at this stage of a project see <xref href="DUEPROCESSHANDBOOK_3.74R3.77.dita">paragraph 3.77</xref>.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
