The purpose of         these consultations is to inform the Board so that it can establish an appropriate scope for         the review. How extensive the consultations need to be in this phase will depend on the         Standard being reviewed and on what the Board already knows about the implementation of that         Standard. The Board needs to be satisfied that it has sufficient information to establish         the scope of the review.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
