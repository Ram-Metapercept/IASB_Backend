The first involves an initial identification and assessment of         the matters to be examined, which are then the subject of a public consultation by the Board         in the form of a request for information. In the second phase, the Board considers the         comments it has received from the request for information along with the information it has         gathered through other consultative activities. On the basis of that information, the Board         presents its findings and sets out the steps it plans to take, if any, as a result of the         review.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
