The         objective of including such explanatory material is to improve the consistency of         application of IFRS Standards. An agenda decision typically includes explanatory material         when the reason for not adding a standard-setting project to the work plan is the         Interpretations Committee&#x2019;s conclusion that the principles and requirements in the Standards         provide an adequate basis for an entity to determine the required accounting. Explanatory         material included as part of a tentative agenda decision is subject to comment.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
