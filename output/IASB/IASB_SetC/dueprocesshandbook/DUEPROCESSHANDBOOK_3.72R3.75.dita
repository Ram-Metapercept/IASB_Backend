Public hearings include round-table meetings and         discussion forums. Round-table meetings are primarily consultative, providing participants         with the opportunity to present and discuss their analysis of Board proposals. Discussion         forums tend to have more of an educational focus, with Board members or technical staff         explaining the Board&#x2019;s proposals before discussing them with the participants.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
