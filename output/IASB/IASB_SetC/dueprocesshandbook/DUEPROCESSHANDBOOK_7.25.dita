If         an Interpretation is not ratified by the Board, the Board provides the Interpretations         Committee with reasons for the objection. On the basis of these reasons, the Board will decide         whether to refer the matter back to the Interpretations Committee, whether to consider it         further or whether to take no further action. The Board may make editorial changes to the         IFRIC Interpretation or change the effective date, and it informs the Interpretations         Committee of any changes it makes.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
