Specifically, Board members are asked whether they object         to (a) the Interpretations Committee&#x2019;s decision that a standard-setting project should not         be added to the work plan, and (b) the Interpretations Committee&#x2019;s conclusion that the         agenda decision does not add or change requirements in IFRS Standards. If four or more Board         members object, the agenda decision is not published and the Board decides how to         proceed.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
