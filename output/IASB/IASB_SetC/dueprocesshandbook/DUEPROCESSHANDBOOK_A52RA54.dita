Editorial corrections do not alter the intended accounting meaning of IFRS Taxonomy elements or change the technology of the IFRS Taxonomy. For example, editorial corrections may fix specific XBRL attributes such as debit or credit or element label spelling errors. The technical staff may also make maintenance-type changes to the IFRS Taxonomy, such as, for example, an update to the effective and expiry dates of the IFRS Taxonomy elements to reflect the passage of time. Editorial corrections and maintenance-type amendments are considered post-publication procedures, and do not need to be approved, reviewed or exposed for public consultation.</p>   </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
