The technical staff         provides a summary of the comment letters, giving a general overview of the comments received         and the major points raised in the letters. The analysis helps the Board to identify the main         topics for consideration during the deliberations&#x2014;or whether the Board should even proceed         with the project.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
