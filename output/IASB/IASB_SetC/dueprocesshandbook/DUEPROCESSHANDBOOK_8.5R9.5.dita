Retrospective steps can be taken to remedy such a situation if it arises and the DPOC         may decide that no additional action is required if it concludes that no harm has been done as         a result of the breach. In this circumstance the DPOC will make public its conclusions and         discussions in line with the reporting requirements set out in <xref href="DUEPROCESSHANDBOOK_2.15.dita" scope="local">paragraph 2.15</xref>.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
