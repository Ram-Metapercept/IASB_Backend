During such meetings Board members are often asked to         indicate to the staff which technical alternative they support. These tentative votes on         particular technical matters provide the technical staff with direction from the Board to         develop the relevant due process document, but are not part of the formal approval process.         Individual Board members may prefer an alternative financial reporting treatment to that         supported by a majority of the Board, but nevertheless consider that the project proposals         as a whole would improve financial reporting.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
