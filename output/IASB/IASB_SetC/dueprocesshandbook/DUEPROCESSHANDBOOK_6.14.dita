The Board assesses proposed annual improvements against the criteria set         out in paragraphs 6.10&#x2013;6.13 before they are published in an exposure draft. As a guide, if         the Board takes several meetings to reach a conclusion it is an indication that the cause of         the issue is more fundamental than can be resolved within the annual improvements         process.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
