The DPOC receives this information in the periodic           technical update report and the review of due process at the end of a project (see paragraph           2.12). The Board needs to be satisfied that it has gathered sufficient information from           investors to make informed decisions about the proposed new requirements.</p>       </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
