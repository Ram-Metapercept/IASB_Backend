A decision to publish an           exposure draft or issue an IFRS Standard requires a supermajority (see paragraph 3.14). Board           members who disagree with the proposals or the final Standard are required to explain why they           have a dissenting opinion. Such dissenting opinions are published with the basis for           conclusions.</p>       </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
