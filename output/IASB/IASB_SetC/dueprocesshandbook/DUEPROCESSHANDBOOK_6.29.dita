If the Board decides that         re-exposure is necessary, the due process to be followed is the same as for the first         exposure draft. However, because it is not the first exposure of the proposed IFRS Standard,         it may be appropriate to have a shortened comment period, particularly if the Board is         seeking comments on only specific aspects of the revised exposure draft, while recognising         that respondents may not limit their comments to these aspects. The public comment period         for such documents will normally be at least 90 days.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
