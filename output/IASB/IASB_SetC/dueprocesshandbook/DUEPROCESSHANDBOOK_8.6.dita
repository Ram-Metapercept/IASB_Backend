Because of this, an entity might determine that it needs to change an accounting policy<xref keyref="footnotes/DUEPROCESSHANDBOOK_8.6_FN0001" type="fn"/> as a result of an agenda decision. It is         expected that an entity would be entitled to sufficient time to make that determination and         implement any necessary accounting policy change (for example, an entity may need to obtain         new information or adapt its systems to implement a change). Determining how much time is         sufficient to make an accounting policy change is a matter of judgement that depends on an         entity&#x2019;s particular facts and circumstances. Nonetheless an entity would be expected to         implement any change on a timely basis and, if material, consider whether disclosure related         to the change is required by IFRS Standards.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
