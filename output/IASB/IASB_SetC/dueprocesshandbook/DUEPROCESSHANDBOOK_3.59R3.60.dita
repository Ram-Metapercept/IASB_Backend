It is not mandatory to have such a group, but if the Board decides not to do so, it         explains that decision on the project page and informs the DPOC. The composition of a         consultative group reflects the purpose for which the group is being formed, bearing in mind         the need to ensure that it draws on a diverse and geographically balanced membership. The         composition of a consultative group may change over time, reflecting the need for different         types of expertise at different stages of a project.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
