It is the strength of the analysis provided in comment letters, and the evidence         supporting the analysis, that is important. An analysis of the type of respondent and their         geographical origin can help the Board assess whether there are any areas or types of         respondent for which additional outreach might be appropriate. For some technical matters it         can be helpful if the technical staff provides the Board with an analysis of the extent to         which the views of particular sectors are shared or divided&#x2014;for example, the extent to which         investors have a common view or whether views differ between the types of respondent or         regions.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
