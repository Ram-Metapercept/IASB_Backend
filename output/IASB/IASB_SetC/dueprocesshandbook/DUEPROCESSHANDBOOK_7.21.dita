The mandatory effective date is set so that         jurisdictions have sufficient time to incorporate the new requirements into their legal         systems and those applying the Standards have sufficient time to prepare for the new         requirements. Interpretations generally address matters of a narrower scope than a major         amendment to a Standard so the time necessary to prepare for the new requirements is also         likely to be shorter.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
