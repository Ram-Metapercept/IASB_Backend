During the development phase of a surface mine (before production begins), stripping costs are usually capitalised as part of the depreciable cost of building, developing and constructing the mine if it is probable that these costs will be recovered through future mining activity. These capitalised costs are depreciated or amortised on a systematic basis, usually by using the units of production method, once production begins.</p></body></paragraph>
