The Committee decided that the subsequent measurement basis of the stripping activity asset should follow that of the existing asset of which it is a part, that is, if the existing asset is measured using a cost basis, then the stripping activity asset would also be measured using a cost basis. The Committee also decided that there was no need for specific impairment guidance to be given and expects that the principles in <xref id="IFRIC20_X0085" base="F17326252" href="../ias36/IAS36_TOC0001.dita#IAS36_TOC0001">IAS 36 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Impairment of Assets</ph></ph></xref> would be applied to the existing asset of which the stripping activity asset is a part, and not at the level of the stripping activity asset itself.</p></body></paragraph>
