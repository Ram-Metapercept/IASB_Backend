Therefore the Board decided to define &#x2018;an interest in an entity&#x2019; as contractual or non&#x2011;contractual involvement that exposes the entity to variability of returns.  In addition, the Board decided to state explicitly that the disclosures about an entity&#x2019;s exposure to risk should include risk that arises from previous involvement with a structured entity even if an entity no longer has any contractual involvement with the structured entity at the end of the reporting period. </p></body></paragraph>
