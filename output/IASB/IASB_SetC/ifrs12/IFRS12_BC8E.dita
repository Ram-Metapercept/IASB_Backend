Although acknowledging that some requirements in IFRS 12 might be more relevant to interests within the <xref id="IFRS12_X0429" base="F60693493" href="../ifrs05/IFRS05_g2-5B.dita#IFRS05_g2-5B/IFRS05_g2-5B_TI">scope of IFRS 5</xref> than others, the Board noted that this is also true for interests not within the scope of IFRS 5. This is because the relevance of each disclosure requirement for particular interests depends on the specific facts and circumstances relating to such interests. This is implicit in the requirements in <xref id="IFRS12_X0430" base="F60693494" href="IFRS12_4.dita#IFRS12_4">paragraph 4</xref>, which require an entity to apply judgement in determining the amount of information to disclose about its interests in other entities to satisfy the disclosure objective.</p></body></paragraph>
