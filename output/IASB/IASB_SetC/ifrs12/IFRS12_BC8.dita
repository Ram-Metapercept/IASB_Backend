A joint operation is a joint arrangement that is not necessarily structured through an entity that is separate from the parties to the joint arrangement. Therefore, an interest in a joint operation does not necessarily represent an interest in another entity. The Board decided to include disclosure requirements for joint operations in IFRS 12 because it believes that the benefits of having all disclosure requirements for joint arrangements in one place outweighs the disadvantages of including disclosure requirements about interests in joint operations in a standard that otherwise deals with an entity&#x2019;s interests in other entities.</p></body></paragraph>
