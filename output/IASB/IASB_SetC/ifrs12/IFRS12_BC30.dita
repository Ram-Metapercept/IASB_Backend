Users of financial statements noted that, in addition to legal requirements, the existence of non&#x2011;controlling interests in a subsidiary might restrict the subsidiary&#x2019;s ability to transfer funds to the parent or any of its other subsidiaries. However, the disclosure requirement in IAS 27 regarding significant restrictions did not refer explicitly to non&#x2011;controlling interests.</p></body></paragraph>
