Consequently, the Board decided to replace &#x2018;significant&#x2019; with &#x2018;material&#x2019;, which is also used in <xref base="F75018319" href="../ifrs03/IFRS03_TOC.dita#IFRS03_TOC0001" id="IFRS12_X0487">IFRS 3</xref>. The Board noted that materiality should be assessed in relation to an entity&#x2019;s consolidated financial statements or other primary financial statements in which joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method.</p>     </variant></body></paragraph>
