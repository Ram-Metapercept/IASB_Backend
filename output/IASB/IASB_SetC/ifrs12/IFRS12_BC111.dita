Rather, the Board thought that all the proposed disclosures had the potential to provide important information. Depending on a particular set of facts and circumstances, some of the proposed disclosures would be very relevant whereas others would not. Therefore, an entity might be expected to provide some, but not all, of the disclosures included in the list.</p></body></paragraph>
