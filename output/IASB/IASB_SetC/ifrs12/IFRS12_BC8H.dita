Because the requirements in IFRS 12 generally apply only to annual financial statements, an effective date of 1 January 2017 would typically mean that the earliest an entity would be required to apply the amendments would be within financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017. Accordingly, an effective date of 1 January 2017 provides an entity with more than a year to prepare to implement the amendments. In addition, the Board noted that the amendments are clarifying in nature.</p></body></paragraph>
