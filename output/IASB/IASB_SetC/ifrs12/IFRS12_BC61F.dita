The Board decided that some (eg summarised financial information and information about non-controlling interests) are not applicable to investment entities and are inconsistent with the assertion that fair value information is the most relevant information for investment entities. Consequently, the Board decided to specify the IFRS 12 requirements applicable to the unconsolidated subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures held by investment entities.</p>  </variant></body></paragraph>
