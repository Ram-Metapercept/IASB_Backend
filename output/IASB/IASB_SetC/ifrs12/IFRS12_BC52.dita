Assets and liabilities arising from joint operations are an entity&#x2019;s assets and liabilities and consequently are recognised in the entity&#x2019;s financial statements. Those assets and liabilities would be accounted for in accordance with the requirements of applicable IFRSs, and would be subject to the relevant disclosure requirements of those IFRSs. Therefore the Board concluded that entities should not be required to provide summarised financial information separately for joint operations.</p></body></paragraph>
