Some had concerns about confidentiality when providing summarised financial information on an individual basis for some joint ventures that were established to implement a single project. Others, including users of financial statements, were concerned that the elimination of proportionate consolidation would result in a loss of information. They therefore requested more detailed disclosures so that the effect of joint ventures on the activities of an entity could be better understood. They stated that there was a need for a detailed breakdown of current assets and current and non&#x2011;current liabilities (in particular, cash and financial liabilities excluding trade payables and provisions), which would help users understand the net debt position of joint ventures. These users also highlighted the need for a more detailed breakdown of amounts presented in the statement of comprehensive income (such as depreciation and amortisation) that would help when valuing an entity&#x2019;s investment in a joint venture.</p></body></paragraph>
