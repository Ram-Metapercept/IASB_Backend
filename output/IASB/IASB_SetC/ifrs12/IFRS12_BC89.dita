This would be particularly useful to help understand the likely effect on the performance of an entity attributable to either a loss of income or a restriction on the entity&#x2019;s ability to carry out its usual business activities if there were a significant decrease in the use of structured entities for investing or financing purposes. They noted that during the global financial crisis that started in 2007 investors became concerned about the extent to which entities had been involved with structured investment vehicles. However, few entities disclosed information about the extent of their involvement in establishing such vehicles. It was, therefore, difficult to assess the potential exposure an entity might have. Those users also confirmed that their request for such information precedes the global financial crisis, and is not simply a reaction to it.</p></body></paragraph>
