Consequently, &#x2018;capital&#x2019; could potentially be interpreted to restrict the disclosures only to those commitments that would result in the capitalisation of assets. Instead, the Board concluded that the objective of the disclosure requirement was to provide information about all unrecognised commitments that could result in future operating, investing or financing cash outflows, or in any other type of outflow of resources from the entity in relation to its interests in joint ventures. Consequently, the Board decided to remove &#x2018;capital&#x2019; from the requirement to disclose commitments.</p></body></paragraph>
