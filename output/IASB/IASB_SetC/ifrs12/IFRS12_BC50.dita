This is because presenting the financial information on a &#x2018;100 per cent&#x2019; basis when aggregating that information for all joint ventures or associates would not result in useful information when the entity holds different percentage ownership interests in its joint ventures or associates. In addition, some users and respondents to ED 9 recommended that the disclosures for associates should be aligned with those for joint ventures because investments in associates can be material and are often strategic to an investor with significant influence. Accordingly, the Board decided that summarised financial information should also be provided for each material associate.</p></body></paragraph>
