Moreover, the requirement for such disclosures should not be limited to particular scenarios. Instead, disclosure should be required for all situations in which an entity applies significant judgement in assessing the nature of its interest in another entity. The disclosure requirements formerly in IAS 27 and IAS 28 in this respect were included as examples of situations for which significant judgement might need to be applied. </p></body></paragraph>
