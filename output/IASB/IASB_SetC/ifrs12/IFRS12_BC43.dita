Although joint control is different from significant influence, the Board concluded that the disclosure requirements for joint arrangements and associates could share a common disclosure objective&#x2014;to disclose information that enables users of financial statements to evaluate the nature, extent and financial effects of an entity&#x2019;s interests in joint arrangements and associates, and the nature of the risks associated with those interests. </p></body></paragraph>
