To support that objective, the exposure draft proposed that an entity should disclose the carrying amounts of its assets and liabilities relating to its interests in structured entities, its maximum exposure to loss and the reported amount of assets of structured entities. ED 10 also listed other information (such as information about the assets and funding of structured entities) that might be useful to an assessment of the risks to which an entity is exposed.</p></body></paragraph>
