The Basis for Conclusions was subsequently updated to reflect amendments to the standard. For convenience, the Board has incorporated into its Basis for Conclusions on IFRS 12 material from the Basis for Conclusions on IAS 27 that discusses the requirements in <xref id="IFRS12_X0442" base="F16229462" href="IFRS12_18.dita#IFRS12_18">paragraphs 18 and 19</xref> that the Board has not reconsidered. That material is contained in <xref id="IFRS12_X0443" base="F16229505" href="IFRS12_BC37.dita#IFRS12_BC37">paragraphs BC37&#x2013;BC41</xref>. In those paragraphs cross&#x2011;references to the IFRS have been updated accordingly and minor necessary editorial changes have been made.</p></body></paragraph>
