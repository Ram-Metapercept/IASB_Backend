The disclosures proposed were never intended to compensate for weaknesses in the control definition. <xref base="F16229671" href="../ifrs10/IFRS10_TOC.dita#IFRS10_TOC0001" id="IFRS12_X0521">IFRS 10</xref> documents the Board&#x2019;s determination to develop appropriate and robust consolidation criteria. Rather, the disclosure proposals were intended to complement the consolidation criteria, focusing on an entity&#x2019;s exposure to risk from interests in structured entities that the entity rightly does not consolidate because it does not control them.</p></body></paragraph>
