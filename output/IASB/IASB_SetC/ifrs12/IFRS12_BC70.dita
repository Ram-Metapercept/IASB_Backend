However, the Board noted that when it proposed the disclosure requirements in ED 10, it intended to provide a timely response to particular information needs identified during the global financial crisis that started in 2007. More specifically, users and regulators had expressed concerns about the lack of disclosure relating to investment and securitisation activities that an entity conducts through structured entities. They asked the Board to introduce specific risk disclosures for an entity&#x2019;s interests in unconsolidated structured entities because those particular interests had exposed entities to significant risks in the past. The proposed disclosure requirements in ED 10 were intended to meet those requests. To go beyond structured entities would delay addressing the concerns raised, which would not be beneficial to users.</p></body></paragraph>
