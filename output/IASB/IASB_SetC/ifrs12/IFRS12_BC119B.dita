Feedback from interested parties informed the Board that the changes to their accounting and reporting systems that are needed to capture this information were more onerous than originally envisaged, particularly in respect of comparative periods prior to the effective date of IFRS 12. Consequently, the Board decided to provide additional transition relief by eliminating the requirement to present comparatives for this information for periods beginning before the first year that IFRS 12 is applied.</p></body></paragraph>
