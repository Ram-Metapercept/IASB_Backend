The requirements in <xref base="F16229454" href="IFRS12_11.dita#IFRS12_11" id="IFRS12_X0433">paragraphs 11</xref>, <xref base="F16229455" href="IFRS12_18.dita#IFRS12_18" id="IFRS12_X0434">18 and 19</xref> relate to disclosures about some of the accounting requirements in <xref base="F16229453" href="../ifrs10/IFRS10_TOC.dita#IFRS10_TOC0001" id="IFRS12_X0435">IFRS 10 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Consolidated Financial Statements</ph></ph></xref>, which were carried forward from IAS 27 to IFRS 10 without being reconsidered by the Board. Consequently, the Board did not reconsider the requirements in those paragraphs. In addition, the requirements in <xref base="F16229456" href="IFRS12_22.dita#IFRS12_22" id="IFRS12_X0436">paragraph 22</xref> relate to disclosures about the application of the equity method and restrictions on the ability of joint ventures and associates to transfer funds to the reporting entity. The Board did not reconsider the equity method as part of its joint ventures project. Consequently, and with the exception of its decision to align the requirements for joint ventures and associates as stated in <xref base="F16229457" href="IFRS12_BC6.dita#IFRS12_BC6" id="IFRS12_X0437">paragraph BC6</xref>, the requirements in <xref base="F16229458" href="IFRS12_22.dita#IFRS12_22" id="IFRS12_X0438">paragraph 22</xref> were carried forward from IAS 28 without being reconsidered by the Board. Accordingly, when the Board approved IFRS 12 for issue, it brought forward from IAS 27 and IAS 28 without reconsideration the requirements now in <xref base="F16229459" href="IFRS12_11.dita#IFRS12_11" id="IFRS12_X0439">paragraphs 11</xref>, <xref base="F16229460" href="IFRS12_18.dita#IFRS12_18" id="IFRS12_X0440">18, 19</xref> and <xref base="F16229461" href="IFRS12_22.dita#IFRS12_22" id="IFRS12_X0441">22 of IFRS 12</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
