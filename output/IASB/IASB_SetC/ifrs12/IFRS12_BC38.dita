The Board noted that IFRSs require this information to be provided in the statement of changes in equity or in the notes to the financial statements. This is because <xref base="F16229618" href="../ias01/IAS01_TOC.dita#IAS01_TOC0001" id="IFRS12_X0477">IAS 1</xref> requires an entity to present, within the statement of changes in equity, a reconciliation between the carrying amount of each component of equity at the beginning and end of the period, disclosing separately each change. </p></body></paragraph>
