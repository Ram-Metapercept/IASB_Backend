However, if IFRS 12 required the disclosure of expected losses only, the Board was concerned that an entity might often identify a positive expected value of returns from its interests in unconsolidated structured entities and, as a consequence, would not disclose any loss exposure. Accordingly, the Board retained the requirement to disclose an entity&#x2019;s maximum exposure to loss from interests in unconsolidated structured entities. </p></body></paragraph>
