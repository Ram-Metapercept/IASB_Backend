The Board was convinced by comments received from US preparers, auditors and users about their experience with the US GAAP requirements to disclose information about involvement with variable interest entities. Involvement is not defined by US GAAP but is interpreted in a way similar to how &#x2018;interest in&#x2019; is defined in IFRS 12. US preparers and users generally agreed with the scope of the disclosure requirements&#x2014;US users of financial statements thought that the revised disclosure requirements provided them with an appropriate degree of detail; US preparers and accountants thought that the disclosure requirements allow entities to focus on presenting information that is considered relevant for users of financial statements. US preparers and accountants also noted that both the aggregation guidance and the requirement that an entity should determine, in the light of facts and circumstances, how much detail it must give to satisfy the disclosure requirements provide sufficient flexibility for preparers.</p></body></paragraph>
