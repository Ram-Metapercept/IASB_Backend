This is because the information will provide users with a better understanding of the differences between the maximum loss exposure and the expectation of whether it is likely that an entity will bear all or only some of those losses. In the past, maximum exposure to loss information (when it was provided) was often accompanied by a statement that the information did not in any way represent the losses to be incurred. The Board reasoned that this disclosure requirement should help an entity explain why the maximum exposure to loss is unrepresentative of its actual exposure if that is the case.</p></body></paragraph>
