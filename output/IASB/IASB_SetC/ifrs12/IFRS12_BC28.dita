Although users have requested financial information about all subsidiaries that are material to the group, the Board decided to require financial information only for those subsidiaries with material non&#x2011;controlling interests. A requirement to disclose information about subsidiaries with immaterial or no non&#x2011;controlling interests might prove to be onerous to prepare without any significant benefit for users, who are expected to benefit most from having financial information about subsidiaries with material non&#x2011;controlling interests. Summarised financial information about subsidiaries with material non&#x2011;controlling interests helps users predict how future cash flows will be distributed among those with claims against the entity including the non&#x2011;controlling interests.</p></body></paragraph>
