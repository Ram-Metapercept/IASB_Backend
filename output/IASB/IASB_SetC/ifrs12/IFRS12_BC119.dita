In reaching that decision, the Board observed that if an entity chooses to apply some, but not all, of the requirements of IFRS 12 early, the entity would be required to continue to apply the disclosure requirements of IAS 27, IAS 28 and IAS 31 until such time that it applies all the requirements of IFRS 12.</p></body></paragraph>
