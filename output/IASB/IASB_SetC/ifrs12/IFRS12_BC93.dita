However, other respondents to ED 10, although agreeing that risk disclosures were required, thought that the proposed disclosure requirements were too prescriptive. In their view, an entity should be allowed to disclose its risk exposure on the basis of the information generated by its internal risk reporting system rather than on the basis of the information proposed in ED 10.</p></body></paragraph>
