There are two reasons for this. The first is that such a definition would require extensive application guidance to help determine the sufficiency of the equity, similar to US GAAP, to which the Board was opposed for the reasons noted in <xref id="IFRS12_X0532" base="F16229738" href="IFRS12_BC83.dita#IFRS12_BC83">paragraph BC83</xref>. The second is that the Board feared that some traditional operating entities might be caught by such a definition when it had no intention of doing so. For example, a traditional operating entity whose financing had been restructured following a downturn in activities might be deemed to be a structured entity, which was not what the Board intended.</p></body></paragraph>
