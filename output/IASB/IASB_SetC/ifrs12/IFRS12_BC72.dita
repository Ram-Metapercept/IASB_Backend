What is different is how the disclosure requirements describe an entity&#x2019;s risk exposure. IFRS 7 requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures about the credit, liquidity, market and other risks associated with financial instruments. IFRS 12 adopts a different perspective and requires an entity to disclose its exposure to risk from its interest in a structured entity.</p></body></paragraph>
