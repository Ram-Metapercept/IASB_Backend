The Board concluded that an entity should provide information that meets both sets of disclosure requirements if it has interests in joint ventures or associates that are structured entities. In reaching this conclusion, the Board noted that an entity should capture most, and in some cases all, of the disclosures required for interests in unconsolidated structured entities by providing the disclosures for interests in joint ventures and associates. Accordingly, the Board does not think that this conclusion should significantly increase the amount of information that an entity would be required to provide.</p></body></paragraph>
