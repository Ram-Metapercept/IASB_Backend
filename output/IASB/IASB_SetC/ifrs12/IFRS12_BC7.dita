The Board observed that the disclosure requirements of IAS 27 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements</ph></ph>, IAS 28 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Investments in Associates</ph></ph> and IAS 31 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Interests in Joint Ventures</ph></ph> overlapped in many areas. In addition, many respondents to ED 10 commented that the disclosure requirements for interests in unconsolidated structured entities should not be located in a consolidation standard. Therefore, the Board concluded that a combined disclosure standard for interests in other entities would make it easier to understand and apply the disclosure requirements for subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and unconsolidated structured entities.</p></body></paragraph>
