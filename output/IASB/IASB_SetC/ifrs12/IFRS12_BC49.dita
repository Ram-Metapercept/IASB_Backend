The Board reconsidered the proposal, noting that it would be confusing to present the entity&#x2019;s share of the assets, liabilities and revenue of a joint venture or associate when the entity has neither rights to, nor obligations for, the assets and liabilities of the joint venture or associate. Rather, the entity has an interest in the net assets of the joint ventures or associates. Consequently, the Board concluded that an entity should present the summarised financial information for each material joint venture on a &#x2018;100 per cent&#x2019; basis, and reconcile that to the carrying amount of its investment in the joint venture or associate.</p></body></paragraph>
