For example, the exceptions specify the assumptions to make about the interest rate benchmark-based cash flows. Nevertheless, the Board observed that if an entity makes significant assumptions or judgements in applying the exceptions in those amendments (for example, to determine when the uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform is no longer present), that would be useful information for the users of financial statements. Accordingly, the Board decided to require entities to disclose information about any significant assumptions or judgements that the entity makes in applying the exceptions in the amendments.</p></body></paragraph>
