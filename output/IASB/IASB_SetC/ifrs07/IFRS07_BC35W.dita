They commented that this would result in the disclosure of commercially sensitive information (ie the risk exposure and the hedged rate). They believed that those who do not elect to apply hedge accounting would potentially have an unfair advantage because although they do not have to disclose anything, they could nonetheless gain insight into their competitor&#x2019;s hedge positions. Commercial sensitivity was also of concern to those entities whose competitors are not listed companies or who do not report under IFRSs.</p></body></paragraph>
