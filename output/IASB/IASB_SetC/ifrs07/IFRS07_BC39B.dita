The fair value hierarchy for disclosures is the same as that in SFAS 157 but uses IFRS language pending completion of the fair value measurement project. Although the implicit fair value hierarchy for measurement in <xref base="F43926550" href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_TOC.dita#IFRS09_TOC0001" id="IFRS07_X1552">IFRS 9</xref> is different from the fair value hierarchy in SFAS 157, the Board recognised the importance of using a three-level hierarchy for disclosures that is the same as that in SFAS 157.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
