To prevent an entity from inappropriately obscuring under&#x2011;collateralised financial instruments with others that are over&#x2011;collateralised, <xref id="IFRS07_X1477" base="F17328315" href="IFRS07_13D.dita#IFRS07_13D">paragraph 13D</xref> of IFRS 7 restricts the amounts of cash and/or financial instrument collateral to be disclosed in respect of a recognised financial instrument to more accurately reflect an entity&#x2019;s exposure. However, if rights to collateral can be enforced across financial instruments, such rights can be included in the disclosure provided in accordance with <xref id="IFRS07_X1478" base="F17328314" href="IFRS07_13D.dita#IFRS07_13D">paragraph 13D</xref> of IFRS 7. At no point in time should under&#x2011;collateralisation be obscured.</p></body></paragraph>
