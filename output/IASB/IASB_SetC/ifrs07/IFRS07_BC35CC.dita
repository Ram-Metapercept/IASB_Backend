Hedge accounting disclosures should therefore increase the transparency of how an entity has mitigated these recognition and measurement anomalies. Doing so will help users identify how hedge accounting has affected the entity&#x2019;s statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and statement of financial position.</p></body></paragraph>
