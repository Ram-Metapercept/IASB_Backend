An entity would have been required to group financial assets and financial liabilities separately into classes that were appropriate to the nature of the information disclosed, taking into account the characteristics of those financial instruments and the applicable rights of set&#x2011;off. Many preparers were concerned that the cost of disclosing amounts related to rights of set&#x2011;off in the events of default and insolvency or bankruptcy by class of financial instrument would outweigh the benefit. They also indicated that they often manage credit exposure by counterparty and not necessarily by class of financial instrument.</p></body></paragraph>
