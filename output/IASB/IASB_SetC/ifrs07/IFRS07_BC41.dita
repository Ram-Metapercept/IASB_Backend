<paragraph id="IFRS07_BC41" base="F95306" principles="no"><paranum>BC41</paranum><prolog><data name="standard_number" value="IFRSÂ 7"/><data name="paranum" value="BC41"/></prolog><body><p id="IFRS07_P3185">The Board decided to balance these two objectives by developing an IFRS that sets out principles and minimum requirements applicable to all entities, supported by guidance on implementing the IFRS. The requirements in <xref id="IFRS07_X1565" base="F16459310" href="IFRS07_33.dita#IFRS07_33">paragraphs 33&#x2013;42</xref> combine qualitative disclosures of the entity&#x2019;s exposure to risks arising from financial instruments, and the way in which management views and manages these risks, with quantitative disclosures about material risks arising from financial instruments. The extent of disclosure depends on the extent of the entity&#x2019;s exposure to risks arising from financial instruments. The guidance on implementing the IFRS illustrates how an entity might apply the IFRS. This guidance is consistent with the disclosure requirements for banks developed by the Basel Committee (known as Pillar 3), so that banks can prepare, and users receive, a single co&#x2011;ordinated set of disclosures about financial risk.</p></body></paragraph>
