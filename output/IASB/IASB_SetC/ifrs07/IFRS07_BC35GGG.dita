Respondents to the 2020 Exposure Draft agreed that providing quantitative information about the magnitude of remaining financial instruments that still need to transition to alternative benchmark rates would be useful for understanding the entity&#x2019;s progress towards completing the implementation of the reform. However, respondents said that the requirement to provide this quantitative information based on the carrying amounts of the relevant non-derivative financial instruments may require an entity to make costly enhancements to its reporting systems and implement additional controls and reconciliations. In the light of a limited time frame, this would be challenging for preparers, in particular those preparers that plan to early apply the Phase 2 amendments. These respondents asked the Board to permit entities to disclose quantitative information on alternative bases&#x2014;for example, if information about the carrying amounts of relevant non-derivative financial instruments is not available without undue cost or effort, an entity would be able to disclose the quantitative information on the basis that is reported internally to management as part of implementing the reform.</p></body></paragraph>
