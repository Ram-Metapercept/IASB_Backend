Because entities manage risk in different ways, the Board did not think that users of financial statements would necessarily understand an entity&#x2019;s risk management strategy if it required a specific list of information to be disclosed. Instead, the Board decided to add additional guidance on the type of information that should be included in a risk management description.</p></body></paragraph>
