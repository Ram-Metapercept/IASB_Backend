This is particularly the case for hedges of open portfolios. The Board noted that, because the general hedge accounting model allows hedge accounting for hedges of groups and net positions in relation to closed portfolios, entities need to use a &#x2018;dynamic&#x2019; hedging process for an open portfolio. This means that entities designate hedging relationships for an open portfolio as if it were a closed portfolio for a short period and at the end of that period look at the open portfolio as the next closed portfolio for another short period. The dynamic nature of this process involves frequent discontinuations and restarts of hedging relationships.</p></body></paragraph>
