While some users of financial statements said the proposed disclosure could be useful for understanding the extent of changes to financial instruments to which the practical expedient is being applied, others were sceptical about whether entities would be able to disclose information in sufficient detail for it to be meaningful. In particular, they highlighted the risk that the disclosures would be summarised at such an aggregated level that the information would not be useful. They also said that they would regard a requirement for an entity to explain how it has determined that it met the conditions to apply the practical expedient in <xref href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_5.4.7.dita" scope="local">paragraph 5.4.7 of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 9</ph></ph></xref> to be an audit or regulatory enforcement matter, rather than a matter for disclosure in the financial statements. The Board therefore decided to omit this proposed disclosure requirement from the final amendments to <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 7</ph></ph>.</p></body></paragraph>
