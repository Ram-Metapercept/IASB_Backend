For instance, an entity with more heavily collateralised loans will, all other things being equal, record a smaller loss allowance for credit losses than an entity with unsecured loans. The previous requirements of paragraph 36(b) of IFRS 7 required the disclosure of information similar to that proposed in the 2013 Impairment Exposure Draft. However, the Board received feedback that these collateral disclosures were too onerous and costly to prepare, and therefore proposed to limit the quantitative collateral disclosure requirements to those financial instruments that become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition.</p></body></paragraph>
