Such an approach is consistent with the approach taken in <xref id="IFRS07_X1618" base="F19328258" href="IFRS07_29.dita#IFRS07_29">paragraph 29(a)</xref>, which states that disclosure of fair value is not required when the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value. Moreover, the Board concluded that the requirement might be duplicative for assets that are presented in the statement of financial position because the carrying amount of these assets often represents the maximum exposure to credit risk. In the Board&#x2019;s view, the disclosure requirement should focus on the entity&#x2019;s exposure to credit risk that is not already reflected in the statement of financial position.</p></body></paragraph>
