The Board reasoned that a combination of disclosures about the strike price or repurchase price to repurchase assets,  the fair value of its continuing involvement,  the maximum exposure to loss  and qualitative information about an entity&#x2019;s obligations to provide financial support  are relevant in understanding an entity&#x2019;s exposure to risks.</p></body></paragraph>
