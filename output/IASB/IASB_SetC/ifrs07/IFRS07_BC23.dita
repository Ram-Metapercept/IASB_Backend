The Board extended this requirement to include disclosure of the reason for reclassifications and of the amount reclassified into and out of each category. As noted in <xref id="IFRS07_X1446" base="F15834323" href="IFRS07_BC14.dita#IFRS07_BC14">paragraph BC14</xref>, the Board regards such information as useful because the categorisation of financial instruments has a significant effect on their measurement.</p></body></paragraph>
