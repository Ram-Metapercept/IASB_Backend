The Board concluded that in those situations, users of financial statements need to understand the relationship between those transferred financial assets and the associated liabilities that an entity recognises. Understanding that relationship helps users of financial statements in assessing an entity&#x2019;s cash flow needs and the cash flows available to the entity from its assets.</p></body></paragraph>
