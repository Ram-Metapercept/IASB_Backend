The Board noted during redeliberations on the 2013 Impairment Exposure Draft that default can be interpreted in various ways, ranging from broad judgemental definitions based on qualitative factors to narrower non&#x2011;judgemental definitions focusing only on non&#x2011;payment. The appropriate definition also depends on the nature of the financial instrument in question. Given the various interpretations of default, the Board decided to require the disclosure of an entity&#x2019;s definition of default and the reasons for its selection.</p></body></paragraph>
