The Board expects that, for financial instruments,             information about the measurement basis (or bases) used for the recognition and             measurement of financial instruments is likely to be material to an entity&#x2019;s financial             statements. Consequently, the Board decided to retain the reference in <xref href="IFRS07_21.dita#IFRS07_21">paragraph 21</xref> to &#x2018;measurement basis (or             bases)&#x2019; in describing what accounting policy information relating to financial             instruments could be assessed as material to an entity&#x2019;s financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
