Most respondents to the 2020 Exposure Draft supported the proposed disclosure objectives and broadly agreed with the proposed disclosures. However, respondents suggested that the Board should simplify aspects of the disclosure required by <xref href="IFRS07_24J.dita" scope="local">paragraph 24J(b) of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 7</ph></ph></xref>. Furthermore, respondents asked the Board to reconsider whether disclosure of information about how an entity applied the requirements in <xref href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_5.4.6.dita" scope="local">paragraphs 5.4.6&#x2013;5.4.8 of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 9</ph></ph></xref> would provide useful information to users of financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
