Therefore, the Board decided to require disclosure of this information. The Board also decided to balance two objectives:</p><ol id="IFRS07_L0170" base="SL166282" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS07_P3183" base="SL166284">consistent requirements should apply to all entities so that users receive comparable information about the risks to which entities are exposed.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS07_P3184" base="SL166286">the disclosures provided should depend on the extent of an entity&#x2019;s use of financial instruments and the extent to which it assumes associated risks. Entities with many financial instruments and related risks should provide more disclosure to communicate those risks to users of financial statements. Conversely, entities with few financial instruments and related risks may provide less extensive disclosure.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
