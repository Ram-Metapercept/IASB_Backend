As explained in paragraph BC44 of the Basis for Conclusions on the 2019 Exposure Draft, the Board noted that <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 7</ph></ph> already requires specific disclosures about hedge accounting. The Board proposed that for some specifically identified disclosures, information be provided separately for hedging relationships to which the proposed exceptions apply. Specifically, the Board proposed that an entity provide separately the information required by paragraphs <xref href="IFRS07_24A.dita">24A(a)</xref>, <xref href="IFRS07_24A.dita">24A(c)&#x2013;(d)</xref>, <xref href="IFRS07_24B.dita">24B(a)(i)&#x2013;(ii)</xref>, <xref href="IFRS07_24B.dita">24B(a)(iv)</xref> and <xref href="IFRS07_24B.dita">24B(b) of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 7</ph></ph></xref> for hedging relationships affected by interest rate benchmark reform.</p></body></paragraph>
