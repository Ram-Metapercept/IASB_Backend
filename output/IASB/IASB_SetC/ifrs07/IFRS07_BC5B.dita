This was in response to requests from users of financial statements and recommendations from the Financial Stability Board to achieve convergence of the boards&#x2019; requirements for offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities. The different requirements result in a significant difference between amounts presented in statements of financial position prepared in accordance with IFRSs and amounts presented in statements of financial position prepared in accordance with US GAAP, particularly for entities that have large amounts of derivative activities. The proposals in the exposure draft would have replaced the requirements for offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities and would have established a common approach with the FASB. After considering the responses to the exposure draft, the boards decided to maintain their respective offsetting models. However, to meet the needs of users of financial statements, the boards agreed jointly on additional disclosures to enable users of financial statements to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements, including rights of set&#x2011;off associated with an entity&#x2019;s recognised financial assets and recognised financial liabilities, on the entity&#x2019;s financial position. <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Disclosures&#x2014;Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities</ph></ph> (Amendments to IFRS 7) was issued in December 2011 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 and interim periods within those annual periods.</p><variants id="IFRS07_E0236">  </variants></body></paragraph>
