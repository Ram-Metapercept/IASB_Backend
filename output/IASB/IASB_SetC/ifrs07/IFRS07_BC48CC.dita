To provide users of financial statements with information about the changes in the loss allowance and the entity&#x2019;s exposure to credit risk on financial instruments, the 2013 Impairment Exposure Draft proposed a disaggregation of the carrying amounts of financial instruments into credit risk categories, for both 12-month and lifetime expected credit losses.</p></body></paragraph>
