An entity should apply judgement when it determines the appropriate level of aggregation or disaggregation. However, the Board proposed that an entity should consider other disclosure requirements in IFRS 7 when it considers the appropriate level of aggregation or disaggregation. For example, users should be able to take amounts that are disclosed and measured at fair value and make comparisons between the fair value disclosures and the proposed hedge accounting disclosures.</p></body></paragraph>
