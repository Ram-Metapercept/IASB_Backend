However, if such information is already presented elsewhere the Board decided that, in order to avoid duplication, an entity should be allowed to incorporate that information by cross-reference, which is similar to the approach used by IFRS 7 for some disclosures that can be incorporated by reference. The Board thinks that the information will be more transparent and easier to understand if it is presented in one location within the entity&#x2019;s financial statements. </p></body></paragraph>
