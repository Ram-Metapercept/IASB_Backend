Some entities might be required by regulatory authorities to provide in a separate report information similar to that required by the IFRS. Accordingly, the Board decided these disclosures should be given in the financial statements or incorporated by cross&#x2011;reference from the financial statements to some other statement that is available to users of the financial statements on the same terms as the financial statements and at the same time.</p></body></paragraph>
