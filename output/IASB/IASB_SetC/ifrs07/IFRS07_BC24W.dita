In addition, <xref id="IFRS07_X1482" base="F17328350" href="IFRS07_34.dita#IFRS07_34">paragraph 34</xref> of IFRS 7 requires the disclosure of concentrations of risk for each type of risk. Consequently, the Board noted that, irrespective of whether the disclosures were required to be provided by type or by class of financial instrument or by counterparty, entities are already required to disclose information about risks and how they are managed, including information about concentrations of credit risk.</p></body></paragraph>
