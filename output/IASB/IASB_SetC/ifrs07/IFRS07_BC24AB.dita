The boards did not believe that this was the case with the proposed disclosure requirements. Retrospective transition would require an entity to apply the new requirements to all periods presented. This would maximise consistency of financial information between periods. Retrospective transition would enable analysis and understanding of comparative accounting information among entities. In addition, the scope of the disclosures was reduced and the disclosures amended to require less detailed information than originally proposed, which would make them less burdensome for preparers to apply retrospectively.</p></body></paragraph>
