Respondents to the 2020 Exposure Draft said that in the light of the regulatory nature of the reform, entities might be unable to provide this information in a way that would be sufficiently detailed and entity-specific for it to be useful to users of financial statements. Respondents often described the potential challenges in disclosing this information in a meaningful way by reference to multinational entities that are exposed to different alternative benchmark rates. These respondents said that if the proposed disclosure was intended to confirm that the changes were economically equivalent, then the disclosure was unnecessary. The fact that an entity has applied the practical expedient would automatically inform users of financial statements that the entity has assessed that the conditions for applying the practical expedient were met. These respondents also said that, if applying those conditions required significant judgement, <xref href="../ias01/IAS01_122.dita" scope="local">paragraph 122 of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 1</ph></ph></xref> would require an entity to disclose those judgements.</p></body></paragraph>
