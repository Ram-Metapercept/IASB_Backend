For example, a payable related to a repurchase agreement may be measured at amortised cost, while a derivative asset or derivative liability subject to the same disclosure requirements (for example, in <xref id="IFRS07_X1460" base="F17328242" href="IFRS07_13C.dita#IFRS07_13C">paragraph 13C(a)</xref> of IFRS 7) will be measured at fair value. In addition, the fair value amount of any financial instrument collateral received or pledged and subject to <xref id="IFRS07_X1461" base="F17328273" href="IFRS07_13C.dita#IFRS07_13C">paragraph 13C(d)(ii)</xref> of IFRS 7 should be included in the disclosures to provide users of financial statements with the best information about an entity&#x2019;s exposure. Consequently, a financial asset or financial liability disclosure table may include financial instruments measured at different amounts. To provide users of financial statements with the information they need to evaluate the amounts disclosed in accordance with <xref id="IFRS07_X1462" base="F17328274" href="IFRS07_13C.dita#IFRS07_13C">paragraph 13C</xref> of IFRS 7, the boards decided that an entity should describe any resulting measurement differences in the related disclosures. </p></body></paragraph>
