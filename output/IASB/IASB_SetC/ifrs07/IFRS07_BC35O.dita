In the Board&#x2019;s view an entity should apply judgement and categorise risks on the basis of how it manages its risks through hedging. For example, an entity manages its floating interest rate risk using interest rate swaps (to change it to a fixed interest rate) for some hedging relationships (cash flow hedges), while it also uses cross-currency interest rate swaps to manage both the floating interest rate and foreign exchange risk of other hedging relationships (cash flow hedges). Consequently, the entity would have one risk category for floating interest rate risk and another risk category for foreign exchange risk combined with floating interest rate risk. However, an entity should apply its risk categories consistently throughout all the proposed hedge accounting disclosures.</p></body></paragraph>
