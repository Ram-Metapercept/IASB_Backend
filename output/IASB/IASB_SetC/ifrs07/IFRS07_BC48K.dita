In the Board&#x2019;s view, users of financial statements would further benefit from a qualitative explanation of changes in estimates of expected credit losses. Estimates of expected credit losses may change, for example, because of changes in the volume of financial instruments, changes in overall market conditions or as a result of a significant event (for example, a sovereign debt crisis, weather-related events or other disasters). The disclosures should therefore include a qualitative narrative describing how significant events have affected the entity&#x2019;s estimate of expected credit losses.</p></body></paragraph>
