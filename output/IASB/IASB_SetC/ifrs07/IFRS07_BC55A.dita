Within a class of assets some might be over&#x2011;collateralised while others might be under&#x2011;collateralised. Hence, aggregate disclosure of the fair value might be misleading. Therefore, the Board removed from <ph>paragraph 37(c)</ph> the requirement to disclose the fair value of collateral and other credit enhancements. However, the Board believes that information on the financial effect of such assets is useful to users. Hence, the Board included in <xref base="F15833944" href="IFRS07_36.dita" scope="local" id="IFRS07_X1631">paragraph 36(b)</xref> a requirement to disclose a description of collateral held as security and of other credit enhancements and to disclose their financial effect.</p></body></paragraph>
