The Board maintained the view that information about the financial effect of collateral is useful. However, the Board noted that it did not intend to require providing information about the fair value of collateral. In addition, the Board decided that qualitative information should be disclosed about how collateral and other credit enhancements have been incorporated into the measurement of expected credit losses on all financial instruments.</p></body></paragraph>
