Users of financial statements indicated that they were concerned about the relative nature of the disclosure that is based on the range of credit risk relevant to the entity&#x2019;s portfolio and that it would lack comparability as a result (ie a high risk for one entity may only be a medium risk for another). Furthermore, without vintage information, a user would not be able to determine whether changes in the risk profile are a result of changes in the credit risk of existing financial instruments or a result of the credit risk of new instruments recognised during the period. However, they believed that risk disaggregation would still provide insight into an entity&#x2019;s exposure to credit risk and were therefore in favour of including it in the notes to the financial statements. The Board required the disclosure because changes in risk will affect the measurement of expected credit losses and it would therefore provide users of financial statements with information about the drivers of the change in the measurement. The Board also noted that this disclosure, particularly when considered together with the reconciliation of the gross carrying amount and loss allowance, provides relevant and useful information about credit risk migration and changes in overall credit risk over time.</p></body></paragraph>
