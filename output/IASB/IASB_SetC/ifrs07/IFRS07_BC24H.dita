Such rights are often a result of statute, and entities do not typically manage their credit risk related to such amounts based on these rights of set&#x2011;off. In addition, entities that have contractual rights to set off customer deposits with loans only in situations such as events of default see these rights as a credit enhancement and not as the primary source of credit mitigation. Respondents argued that the cost of including these amounts in the amended disclosures would outweigh the benefit because users of financial statements did not request information related to these instruments when discussing the offsetting disclosure requirements.</p></body></paragraph>
