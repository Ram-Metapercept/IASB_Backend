However, as noted in <xref id="IFRS07_X1593" base="F43926599" href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_B5.5.2.dita#IFRS09_B5.5.2">paragraph B5.5.2 of IFRS 9</xref>, an entity may not have access to reasonable and supportable information that enables it to identify significant increases in credit on an individual basis prior to financial assets becoming past due. Furthermore, an entity may only be able to incorporate forward-looking information in its estimates of expected credit losses on a collective basis. The Board therefore decided instead to require the disclosure of information about how an entity has grouped financial instruments if they are assessed or measured on a collective basis.</p></body></paragraph>
