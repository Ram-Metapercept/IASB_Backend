However, there was consensus that both gross and net information are useful and necessary for analysing financial statements. Users of financial statements supported achieving convergence of the IFRS and US GAAP requirements, and also supported improving disclosures so that financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRSs and US GAAP would be more comparable. Comparable information is important to investors for calculating their ratios and performing their analyses.</p></body></paragraph>
