The deferred amounts are reflected in the statement of changes in equity in the cash flow hedge reserve. <xref base="F34942678" href="../ias01/IAS01_TOC.dita#IAS01_TOC0001" id="IFRS07_X1530">IAS 1</xref> requires an entity to prepare a reconciliation for each component of equity between the carrying amount at the beginning and at the end of the period. In conformity with its objectives for hedge accounting disclosures, the Board proposed that the reconciliation required by <xref base="F34942679" href="../ias01/IAS01_TOC.dita#IAS01_TOC0001" id="IFRS07_X1531">IAS 1</xref> should have the same level of detail as the information that identifies the effects of hedge accounting on the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. The Board also proposed that the reconciliation should be by type of risk. The Board considered that such a disclosure would allow users of financial statements to evaluate the effects of hedge accounting on equity and the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.</p></body></paragraph>
