Consequently, the Board decided to amend paragraph 44R of IFRS 7 within the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012&#x2013;2014 Cycle</ph></ph> in order to clarify that the additional disclosure required by the amendments to IFRS 7 concerning offsetting is not specifically required for all interim periods. However, when considering this amendment, the Board noted that the additional disclosure is required to be given in condensed interim financial statements prepared in accordance with IAS 34 when its inclusion would be required in accordance with the general requirements of that IFRS. IAS 34 requires the disclosure of information in condensed interim financial statements when its omission would make the condensed interim financial statements misleading. The Board noted that in accordance with paragraph 15 of IAS 34 &#x201C;an entity shall include in its interim financial report an explanation of events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in financial position and performance of the entity since the end of the last annual reporting period&#x201D;. The Board further noted that in accordance with paragraph 25 of IAS 34: &#x201C;The overriding goal is to ensure that an interim financial report includes all information that is relevant to understanding an entity&#x2019;s financial position and performance during the interim period&#x201D;.</p></body></paragraph>
