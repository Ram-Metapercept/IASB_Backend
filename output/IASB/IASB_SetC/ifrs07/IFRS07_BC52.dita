In these circumstances, netting the fair value of the two types of collateral would under&#x2011;report the amount of credit risk. The Board agreed with respondents that the information useful to users is not the total amount of credit exposure less the total amount of collateral, but rather is the amount of credit exposure that is left after available collateral is taken into account.</p></body></paragraph>
