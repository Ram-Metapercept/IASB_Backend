The following diagram illustrates the joint value arising from the interaction between a call option and an equity conversion option in a callable convertible bond. Circle L represents the value of the liability component, ie the value of the straight debt and the embedded call option on the straight debt, and Circle E represents the value of the equity component, ie the equity conversion option on the straight debt.</p><image href="graphics/IFRS07_BC29-graphic.pdf" id="IFRS07_BC29-graphic-pdf" otherprops="print" placement="inline"/><p base="F13754339" id="IFRS07_P3082">The total area of the two circles represents the value of the callable convertible bond. The difference between the value of the callable convertible bond as a whole and the sum of the separately determined values for the liability and equity components is the joint value attributable to the interdependence between the call option feature and the equity conversion feature. It is represented by the intersection between the two circles.</p></body></paragraph>
