The boards recognised that the amounts disclosed in accordance with <xref id="IFRS07_X1483" base="F17328351" href="IFRS07_13C.dita#IFRS07_13C">paragraph 13C(b), (c) and (d)</xref> of IFRS 7 will probably be different for financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRSs and those prepared in accordance with US GAAP. However, the amounts disclosed in accordance with <xref id="IFRS07_X1484" base="F17328352" href="IFRS07_13C.dita#IFRS07_13C">paragraph 13C(a) and (e)</xref> of IFRS 7 are generally not affected by the offsetting criteria applied in the statement of financial position. These amounts are important for users of financial statements to understand the effects of netting arrangements on an entity&#x2019;s financial position in the normal course of business and in the events of default and insolvency or bankruptcy.</p></body></paragraph>
