This is because it would require an entity to maintain parallel systems in order to       determine the amount of the adjustment for each financial statement line item affected.       Furthermore, disclosing this information would be inconsistent with the Board&#x2019;s observation in         <xref href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_BC6.550.dita">paragraph BC6.550 of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 9</ph></ph></xref> and         <xref href="../ias39/IAS39_BC227.dita">paragraph BC227 of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 39</ph></ph></xref>, that discontinuing hedge       accounting solely due to uncertainties arising from the reform would not provide useful       information to users of financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
