The Board also considered that an explanation of how an entity has applied the requirements in <xref base="F68305792" href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_5.5.12.dita#IFRS09_5.5.12" id="IFRS07_X1587">paragraph 5.5.12 of IFRS 9</xref> for the modification of contractual cash flows of financial assets, including how an entity determines whether the credit risk of modified financial assets has improved so that is not considered to be significantly increased compared to initial recognition, would enhance the understanding of how an entity manages credit risk through modifications and restructurings.</p></body></paragraph>
