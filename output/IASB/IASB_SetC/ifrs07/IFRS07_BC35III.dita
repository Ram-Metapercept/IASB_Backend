Quantitative information about financial assets and financial liabilities that&#x2014;as at the end of the reporting period&#x2014;reference interest rate benchmarks that are subject to the reform would therefore assist users of financial statements to assess an entity&#x2019;s progress towards implementing the reform. The Board also considered that for this disclosure to be useful, the quantitative information about non-derivative financial assets, non-derivative financial liabilities and derivatives that continue to reference interest rate benchmarks subject to the reform should be provided in the context of the total non-derivative financial assets, total non-derivative financial liabilities and total derivatives as at the end of the reporting period.</p></body></paragraph>
