The Board observed that the reduction in regulatory barriers in many countries and increasing competition between banks, non&#x2011;bank financial services firms, and financial conglomerates have resulted in many entities providing financial services that were traditionally provided only by entities regulated and supervised as banks. The Board concluded that this development would make it inappropriate to limit this project to banks and similar financial institutions.</p></body></paragraph>
