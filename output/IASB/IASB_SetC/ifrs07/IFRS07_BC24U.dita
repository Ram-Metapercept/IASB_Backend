In evaluating whether the disclosures should be provided by type or by class of financial instrument or by counterparty, the boards noted that the objective of these disclosures (<xref id="IFRS07_X1479" base="F17328318" href="IFRS07_13B.dita#IFRS07_13B">paragraph 13B</xref> of IFRS 7) is that an entity should disclose information to enable users of its financial statements to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on the entity&#x2019;s financial position.</p></body></paragraph>
