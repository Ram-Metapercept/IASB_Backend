This information would be disaggregated by significant interest rate benchmark. An entity would select the basis for disclosing the quantitative information and explain which basis was applied. For example, the quantitative information may be based on:</p><ol type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>         <p>the carrying amounts of non-derivative financial assets, the carrying amount of non-derivative financial liabilities and the nominal amount of derivatives;</p>       </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>         <p>the amounts related to recognised financial instruments (for example, the contractual par amount of non-derivative financial assets and non-derivative financial liabilities, and nominal amounts of derivatives); or</p>       </li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value>         <p>the amounts provided internally to key management personnel (as defined in <xref href="../ias24/IAS24_TOC0001.dita#IAS24_TOC0001" scope="local">IAS 24</xref>) of the entity about these financial instruments, for example, the entity&#x2019;s board of directors or chief executive officer.</p>       </li></ol></body></paragraph>
