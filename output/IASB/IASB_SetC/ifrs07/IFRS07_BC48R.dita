They held the view that the reconciliation of the gross carrying amount of financial instruments would greatly enhance transparency of an entity&#x2019;s financial asset portfolio. While these disclosures would require systems changes and the cost of providing the information would be high, the Board noted that such reconciliations provide key information about movements between 12-month and lifetime loss allowances and about the causes of changes in expected credit losses and about the effect of changes in volume and credit quality.</p></body></paragraph>
