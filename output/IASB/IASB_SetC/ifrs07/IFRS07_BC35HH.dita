However, some respondents raised concerns that the proposal seems too prescriptive. Some also commented that they did not think that the tabular disclosure, as proposed, provided a clear enough link between hedged items and hedging instruments for the purpose of explaining hedge ineffectiveness. A few respondents also commented that the disclosures did not allow them to differentiate between financial instruments that have been designated as hedging instruments and those that have not. These respondents believe that it is helpful to understand the purpose and effect of financial instruments if their designation is made clear through disclosures.</p></body></paragraph>
