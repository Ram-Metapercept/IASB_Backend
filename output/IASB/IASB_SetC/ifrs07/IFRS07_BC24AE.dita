However, the Board did not believe that the IFRS 9 project would change the offsetting disclosures. Aligning the effective date of these amendments with the effective date of the financial instruments project could result in postponing the effective date of the common disclosure requirements, which would mean a delay in providing users of financial statements the information that they need. For users of financial statements to benefit from the increased comparability, and because the offsetting and IFRS 9 projects are independent of one another, the boards decided that common disclosures should be effective as early as possible.</p></body></paragraph>
