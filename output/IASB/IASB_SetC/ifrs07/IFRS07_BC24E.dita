However, the boards noted that requiring common disclosures of gross and net amounts of recognised financial instruments that are (a) set off in the statement of financial position and (b) subject to enforceable master netting arrangements and similar agreements, even if not set off in the statement of financial position, would be helpful for users of financial statements. Accordingly, the boards agreed on common disclosure requirements by amending and finalising the disclosures initially proposed in the exposure draft.</p></body></paragraph>
