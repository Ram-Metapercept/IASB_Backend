In contrast, the disclosure requirement related to the terms and conditions of the hedging instrument was designed to provide information for situations in which an entity hedges a risk that remains broadly the same over the entire hedged period. Consequently, the Board decided to exempt entities from the requirement to disclose the terms and conditions of the hedging instruments in situations in which they use a &#x2018;dynamic&#x2019; hedging process that involves frequent discontinuations and restarts of hedging relationships.</p></body></paragraph>
