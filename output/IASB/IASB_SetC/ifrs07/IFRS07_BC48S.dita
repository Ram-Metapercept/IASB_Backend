However, in the light of the feedback about the operational burden of reconciling the changes in the gross carrying amount of financial assets, the Board clarified that the objective of that reconciliation is to provide information about the key drivers for changes in the gross carrying amount to the extent that it contributes to changes in the loss allowance during the period. Examples of such key drivers for change could include new originations and purchases, deterioration of existing financial instruments resulting in the loss allowance changing to lifetime expected credit losses and financial assets being written off during the period. The Board also acknowledged that although the most relevant and useful information will be provided by disclosing the gross movements between loss allowance measurement categories, in some circumstances, or for some types of financial assets, information will be more useful if the movements are disclosed on a net basis (for example trade receivables accounted for in accordance with the general approach in <xref base="F43926601" href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_TOC.dita#IFRS09_TOC0001" id="IFRS07_X1596">IFRS 9</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
