The boards indicated that they would use such feedback, as well as the responses in their <i>Request for Views on Effective Dates and Transition Methods</i>, and the timing of other planned accounting and reporting standards, to determine an appropriate effective date for the proposals in the exposure draft.</p></body></paragraph>
