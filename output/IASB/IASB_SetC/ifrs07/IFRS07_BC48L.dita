Many entities already disclose the loan balance and loss allowance amount for both collectively and individually assessed credit-impaired loans. Consequently, the 2013 Impairment Exposure Draft proposed amendments to those requirements to limit them to financial instruments that an entity assesses individually for recognition of lifetime expected credit losses.</p></body></paragraph>
