For example, <xref base="F60693587" href="../ifrs07/IFRS07_TOC.dita#IFRS07_TOC0001/IFRS07_TOC0001_V2" id="IAS28_X0459">IFRS 7 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Financial Instruments: Disclosures</ph></ph></xref> uses &#x2018;category&#x2019; to refer to groupings of financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured in different ways&#x2014;for example, financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss is one category of financial asset and financial assets measured at amortised cost is another category of financial asset. The Board observed that <xref base="F60693588" href="../ias27/IAS27_10.dita#IAS27_10/IAS27_10_V3" id="IAS28_X0460">paragraph 10 of IAS 27</xref> should not be read to mean that, in all circumstances, all investments in associates are one &#x2018;category&#x2019; of investment and all investments in joint ventures are one &#x2018;category&#x2019; of investment. The issue raised by respondents arises only if the requirement in paragraph 10 of IAS 27 were to be interpreted in that way. An entity that elects to measure some associates or joint ventures at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with <xref base="F60693589" href="IAS28_18.dita#IAS28_18" id="IAS28_X0461">paragraph 18 of IAS 28</xref> would retain that measurement basis for those associates and joint ventures in its separate financial statements, as required by <xref base="F60693590" href="../ias27/IAS27_11.dita#IAS27_11" id="IAS28_X0462">paragraph 11 of IAS 27</xref>. The entity could then choose to measure its remaining associates and joint ventures either at cost, in accordance with <xref base="F70459370" href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_TOC.dita#IFRS09_TOC0001" id="IAS28_X0463">IFRS 9</xref> or using the equity method in accordance with paragraph 10 of IAS 27.</p></body></paragraph>
