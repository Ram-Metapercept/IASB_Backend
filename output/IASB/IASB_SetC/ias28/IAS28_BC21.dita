The first view identifies all direct and indirect interests held in the associate either by the parent or through any of its subsidiaries, and then applies IAS 28 to the entire investment in the associate. In accordance with this view, there is only one investment in the associate and it should be accounted for as a single unit. The second view identifies all direct and indirect interests held in an associate, but then allows the use of the measurement exemption to portions of an investment in an associate if the portion is held by a venture capital organisation, or a mutual fund, unit trust and similar entities including investment-linked insurance funds, regardless of whether those entities have significant influence over their portion of the investment in the associate. The Board agreed with the second view and therefore amended IAS 28. The Board decided that equivalent guidance on the partial use of fair value for the measurement of investments in joint ventures should not be provided because the Board thought that such events would be unlikely in practice.</p></body></paragraph>
