SIC&#x2011;13 established three exceptions for the recognition of gains or losses attributable to the equity interests of the other parties. In response to comments raised by some respondents to ED 9, the Board redeliberated the need to incorporate into IAS 28 the exceptions included in SIC&#x2011;13 for the recognition by an entity of the portion of a gain or loss attributable to the interests of other unrelated investors in the investee.</p></body></paragraph>
