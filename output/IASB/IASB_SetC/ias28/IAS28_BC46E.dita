This would mean that the subsidiaries of those investment entity associates and joint ventures should be consolidated into the financial statements of those associates and joint ventures prior to the equity method being applied. The Board noted that this is conceptually consistent with the requirement in IFRS 10 for a non-investment entity parent to consolidate subsidiaries held through an investment entity subsidiary.</p></body></paragraph>
