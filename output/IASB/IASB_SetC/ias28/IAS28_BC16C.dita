<paragraph id="IAS28_BC16C" base="F65373990"><paranum>BC16C</paranum><prolog><data name="standard_number" value="IAS 28"/><data name="paranum" value="BC16C"/></prolog><body><p id="IAS28_P0414">The Board concluded that with respect to interests in an associate or joint venture, <xref id="IAS28_X0435" base="F70459317" href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_2.1.dita#IFRS09_2.1">paragraph 2.1(a) of IFRS 9</xref> excludes from the scope of IFRS 9 only interests to which the equity method is applied. Accordingly, the scope exclusion in that paragraph does not include long-term interests (as described in <xref id="IAS28_X0436" base="F68118757" href="IAS28_38.dita#IAS28_38">paragraph 38 of IAS 28</xref>). In reaching this conclusion, the Board noted that IAS 28 mentions long-term interests and the net investment, which includes long-term interests, only in the context of recognising losses of an associate or joint venture and impairment of the net investment in the associate or joint venture. IAS 28 does not specify requirements for other aspects of recognising or measuring long-term interests. Thus, long-term interests are not accounted for in accordance with IAS 28, as envisaged in paragraph 2.1(a) of IFRS 9. The Board also noted that <xref id="IAS28_X0437" base="F68118758" href="IAS28_14.dita#IAS28_14">paragraph 14 of IAS 28</xref> states that &#x2018;IFRS 9 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Financial Instruments</ph></ph> does not apply to interests in associates and joint ventures that are accounted for using the equity method&#x2019;.</p></body></paragraph>
