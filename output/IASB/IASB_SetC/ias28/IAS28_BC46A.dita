The amendments did not introduce any new accounting requirements for investments in associates or joint ventures. This is because paragraphs 18&#x2013;19 of IAS 28 already allowed an investment entity to measure its investments in associates and joint ventures at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9. A wider range of entities, including venture capital organisations, or mutual funds, unit trusts and similar entities including investment-linked insurance funds, may also elect to measure their investments in associates and joint ventures in the same way.</p></body></paragraph>
