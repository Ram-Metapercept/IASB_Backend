The Board reasoned that even if the entity has the intention of selling a portion of an interest in an associate or a joint venture, until it does so it still has significant influence over, or joint control of, that investee. After the disposal, an entity should measure the retained interest in the joint venture or associate in accordance with IFRS 9 or in accordance with IAS 28 if the entity still has significant influence over, or joint control of, the retained interest.</p></body></paragraph>
