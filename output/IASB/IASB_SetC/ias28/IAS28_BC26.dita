As a result, the Board concluded that when the disposal of an interest, or a portion of an interest, in a joint venture or an associate fulfilled the criteria for classification as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5, an entity should classify the whole interest, or a portion of the interest, as held for sale. </p></body></paragraph>
