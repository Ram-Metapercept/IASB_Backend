Some Board members noted that the degree of practical difficulty is different depending on whether the investee is an associate or joint venture. In addition, some Board members noted the structuring risks highlighted in paragraph BC280 of IFRS 10 and noted that an investor&#x2019;s ability to achieve different accounting outcomes by holding investments through an investment entity investee is different depending on whether the investee is an associate or a joint venture. Consequently, in the Exposure Draft <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception</ph></ph> (Proposed amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28) (the &#x2018;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Consolidation Exception</ph></ph> ED&#x2019;), which was published in June 2014, the Board proposed to provide relief to non-investment entity investors for their interests in investment entity associates, but not for their interests in investment entity joint ventures.</p></body></paragraph>
