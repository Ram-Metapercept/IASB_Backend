However, the majority of respondents disagreed with the proposal to limit the relief to interests in investment entity associates, noting that the practicality and cost issues also applied to interests in joint ventures. In addition, some respondents disagreed with the concerns about the risk of structuring, noting that the difference between significant influence and joint control is much smaller than the difference between control and joint control. Consequently, the Board decided to provide relief to non-investment entity investors in both investment entity associates and joint ventures and to retain the consistency in treatment in applying the equity method to both associates and joint ventures. This relief permits, but does not require, a non-investment entity investor to retain the fair value through profit or loss measurement applied by an investment entity associate or joint venture for their subsidiaries when applying the equity method.</p></body></paragraph>
