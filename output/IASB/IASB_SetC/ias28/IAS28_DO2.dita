In his view, because he believes that an investor can identify attributable goodwill when it makes an investment, all impairment losses recognised with respect to the investor&#x2019;s investment in an associate should be allocated to the goodwill and other assets that form part of the carrying amount of the investment.</p></body></paragraph>
