The submission was narrowly and clearly defined, and both bodies concluded they could respond to the submission most efficiently by considering only the submission received. Any reconsideration of the accounting for long-term interests could not be undertaken as a narrow-scope project and would be likely to involve reconsideration of the equity method, a topic included in the Board&#x2019;s pipeline of future research projects. Consequently, the Board limited the amendments to clarifying its intentions when it issued the requirements in IFRS 9 and IAS 28.</p></body></paragraph>
