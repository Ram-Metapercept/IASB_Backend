Those proposals aimed to clarify that all the interest (&#x2018;the whole interest&#x2019;) an entity had in an associate or a joint venture had to be classified as held for sale if the entity was committed to a sale plan involving loss of, significant influence over, or joint control of that interest.</p></body></paragraph>
