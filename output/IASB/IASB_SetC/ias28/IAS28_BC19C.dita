However, after the revision, it had become less clear whether such an election was still available to those entities. The Board noted that it did not consider changing these requirements when revising IAS 28 in 2011, and any lack of clarity that arose as a consequence of the amendments in 2011 was unintentional.</p></body></paragraph>
