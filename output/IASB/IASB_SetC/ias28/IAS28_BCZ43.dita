The Board proposed in the exposure draft <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Improvements to International Financial Reporting Standards</ph></ph> published in October 2007 that an additional impairment recognised by the entity, after applying the equity method, should not be allocated to any asset, including goodwill, that forms part of the carrying amount of the investment. Therefore, such an impairment should be reversed in a subsequent period to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment increases.</p></body></paragraph>
