This is consistent with the proposal contained in the Exposure Draft <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Investment Entities</ph></ph> (the &#x2018;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Investment Entities</ph></ph> ED&#x2019;), which was published in August 2011. Some respondents to the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Investment Entities</ph></ph> ED noted that this seemed inconsistent with paragraphs 18&#x2013;19 of IAS 28, which allow a wider group of entities than only investment entities to measure their investments in associates and joint ventures at fair value through profit or loss. The Board acknowledged this inconsistency, and explained its reasons for not amending IAS 28 in line with IFRS 10, in paragraph BC283 of IFRS 10.</p></body></paragraph>
