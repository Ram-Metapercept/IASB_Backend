Some respondents to that exposure draft believed that it could be impracticable for the entity to prepare financial statements as of the same date when the date of the entity&#x2019;s financial statements and those of the associate or joint venture differ by more than three months. The Board noted that a three-month limit operates in several jurisdictions and it was concerned that a longer period, such as six months, would lead to the recognition of stale information. Therefore, it decided to retain the three-month limit. </p></body></paragraph>
