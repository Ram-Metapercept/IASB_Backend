This requirement is consistent with <xref base="F36872460" href="../ias36/IAS36_TOC0001.dita#IAS36_TOC0001" id="IAS28_X0501">IAS 36</xref>, which permits the reversal of impairment losses for assets other than goodwill. The Board did not propose to align the requirements for the reversal of an impairment loss with those in <xref base="F36872461" href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001" id="IAS28_X0502">IAS 39</xref><xref keyref="footnotes/IAS28_FN0017" type="fn"/> relating to equity instruments, because an entity recognises an impairment loss on an investment in an associate or joint venture in accordance with IAS 36, rather than in accordance with IAS 39.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
