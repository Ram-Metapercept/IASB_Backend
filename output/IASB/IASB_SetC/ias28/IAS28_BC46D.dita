This exception reflects the unique business model of an investment entity, for which fair value information is more relevant than consolidation. This unique business model is not applicable to a non-investment entity parent. Consequently, paragraph 33 of IFRS 10 requires a non-investment entity parent of an investment entity to consolidate all entities that it controls, both directly and indirectly through an investment entity. This requires the non-investment entity parent to unwind the fair value through profit or loss measurement used by its investment entity subsidiaries for indirectly held subsidiaries.</p></body></paragraph>
