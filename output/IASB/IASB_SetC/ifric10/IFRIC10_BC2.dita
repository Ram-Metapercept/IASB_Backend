For annual financial statements, <xref base="F19748433" href="../ias36/IAS36_TOC0001.dita" id="IFRIC10_X0046">IAS 36</xref> prohibits an entity from reversing an impairment loss on goodwill that it recognised in a prior annual period. Similarly, <xref base="F19748434" href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita" id="IFRIC10_X0047" scope="local">IAS 39</xref><xref keyref="footnotes/IFRIC10_FN0001" type="fn"/> prohibits an entity from reversing in a subsequent annual period an impairment loss on an investment in an equity instrument or in a financial asset carried at cost. These requirements might suggest that an entity should not reverse in a subsequent interim period an impairment loss on goodwill or an investment in an equity instrument or in a financial asset carried at cost that it had recognised in a prior interim period. Such impairment losses would not be reversed even if no loss, or a smaller loss, would have been recognised had the impairment been assessed only at the end of the subsequent interim period.</p>     </variant></body></paragraph>
