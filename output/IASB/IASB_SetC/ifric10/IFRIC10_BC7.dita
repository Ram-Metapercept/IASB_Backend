Entity A prepares quarterly interim financial statements and Entity B prepares half&#x2011;yearly financial statements. The entities have the same year&#x2011;end. The IFRIC noted that if there was a significant decline in the fair value of the equity instrument below its cost in the first quarter, Entity A would recognise an impairment loss in its first quarter interim financial statements. However, if the fair value of the equity instrument subsequently recovered, so that by the half&#x2011;year date there had not been a significant decline in fair value below cost, Entity B would not recognise an impairment loss in its half&#x2011;yearly financial statements if it tested for impairment only at its half&#x2011;yearly reporting dates. Therefore, unless Entity A reversed the impairment loss that had been recognised in an earlier interim period, the frequency of reporting would affect the measurement of its annual results when compared with Entity B&#x2019;s approach. The IFRIC also noted that the recognition of an impairment loss could similarly be affected by the timing of the financial year&#x2011;ends of the two entities.</p></body></paragraph>
