The description of the primary users in paragraph 1.5 refers to existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors who cannot require reporting entities to provide information directly to them. Paragraph 1.10 states that &#x2018;regulators and members of the public other than investors, lenders and other creditors&#x2019; may find information in general purpose financial reports useful but states that those are not the parties to whom general purpose financial reports are primarily directed.</p></body></paragraph>
