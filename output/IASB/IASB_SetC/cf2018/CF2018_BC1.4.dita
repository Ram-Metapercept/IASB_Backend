Financial statements are a central part of financial reporting, and most of the issues that the Board addresses involve financial statements. Although the scope of FASB Concepts Statement No.Â 1 <i>Objectives of Financial Reporting by Business Enterprises</i> was financial reporting, the other FASB concepts statements focused on financial statements. The scope of the Board&#x2019;s <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements</ph></ph>, which was published by the Board&#x2019;s predecessor body in 1989 (1989 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph>), dealt with financial statements only. Therefore, for both boards the scope of the 2010 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> is broader than the scopes of their previous frameworks.<xref keyref="footnotes/CF2018_FN0025" type="fn"/></p></body></paragraph>
