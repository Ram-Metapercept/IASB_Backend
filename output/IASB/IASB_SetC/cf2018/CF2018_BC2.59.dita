One of the most important reasons that Standards are needed is to increase the comparability of reported financial information. However, even if it is not readily comparable, information that is relevant and faithfully represents what it purports to represent is still useful. Comparable information, however, is not useful if it is not relevant and may mislead if it does not faithfully represent what it purports to represent. Therefore, comparability is considered an enhancing qualitative characteristic instead of a fundamental qualitative characteristic.</p></body></paragraph>
