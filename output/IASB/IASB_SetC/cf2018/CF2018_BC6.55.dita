Those direct measures might provide users of financial statements with information useful in making decisions relating to providing resources to the entity. This information would be provided from the perspective of the entity and reflect the equity claims held against the entity. Such information would not be provided from the perspective of a particular claimholder.</p></body></paragraph>
