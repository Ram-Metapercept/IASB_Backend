Further, the Board clarified in paragraph 2.22 that following the process described in paragraphs 2.20&#x2013;2.21 a trade-off may need to be made between relevance and faithful representation. One case when such a trade-off may need to be made is when a high level of measurement uncertainty makes it questionable whether an estimate would provide a sufficiently faithful representation of an economic phenomenon. The material in paragraph 2.22 builds on the discussion of measurement uncertainty in paragraph QC16 of the 2010 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> (see paragraph BC2.47).</p></body></paragraph>
