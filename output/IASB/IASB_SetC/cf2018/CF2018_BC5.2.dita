They used different probability thresholds which included &#x2018;probable&#x2019;, &#x2018;more likely than not&#x2019;, &#x2018;virtually certain&#x2019; and &#x2018;reasonably possible&#x2019;.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="CF2018_P1333" base="SL72807745">the application of the probability criterion to some recognition questions could lead to loss of relevant information or a misleading representation of the entity&#x2019;s financial position or financial performance. For example, applying the criterion could prevent the recognition of some derivative financial instruments. Moreover, it could result in a gain being recognised for a transaction when no economic gain has occurred. For example, suppose that, in exchange for receiving cash, an entity incurs a liability to pay a fixed amount if some unlikely event occurs in the future. If the liability is not recognised because an outflow of economic benefits is not considered probable when the entity receives the cash, the entity will recognise an immediate gain at that time. To avoid such problems, some Standards developed before the 2018 <i>Conceptual Framework</i>, for example, <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRSÂ 9</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Financial Instruments</ph></ph>, applied no probability recognition criterion.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="CF2018_P1334" base="SL72807746">the reference to reliability was unclear and could result in inappropriate outcomes. Although reliability was identified as a qualitative characteristic in the 1989 <i>Framework</i>, in the 2010 <i>Conceptual Framework</i>, the term &#x2018;reliability&#x2019; was no longer used to refer to a qualitative characteristic and was not defined (see paragraphs BC2.21&#x2013;BC2.31). In practice, a &#x2018;reliable&#x2019; measure was usually interpreted as one with a tolerable level of measurement uncertainty and perhaps also as verifiable and free from error. Hence, a recognition criterion referring to reliable measurement could be interpreted as one prohibiting recognition of any item that has a high level of measurement uncertainty, even if recognising such an item would provide useful information.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
