It concluded that in the case of such obligations a corresponding right is controlled by society at large&#x2014;the people living in the area. They have the right to receive the services required to restore their environment. Therefore, the 2018 <i>Conceptual Framework</i> identifies no exception to the general principle.</p></body></paragraph>
