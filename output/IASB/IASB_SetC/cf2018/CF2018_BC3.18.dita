The 2018 <i>Conceptual Framework</i> explains that, in determining the boundary of a reporting entity that is not a legal entity and does not comprise only legal entities all linked by a parent&#x2011;subsidiary relationship, the focus is on users&#x2019; information needs. As stated in paragraph 2.4, users need information that is relevant and faithfully represents what it purports to represent. The Board concluded that the completeness and neutrality aspects of the qualitative characteristic of faithful representation are particularly important in determining the boundary of a reporting entity. For example, if the boundary of a reporting entity were determined in such a way that the boundary contains an arbitrary or incomplete set of economic activities, financial information provided in that reporting entity&#x2019;s financial statements would be incomplete and may also lack neutrality. Thus, if the boundary were to be determined in such a way, the resulting information would not meet users&#x2019; information needs. The Board also concluded that to help users to understand what is included in a set of financial statements, those financial statements need to describe how the boundary of the reporting entity was determined and what constitutes the reporting entity.</p></body></paragraph>
