Some respondents used the term &#x2018;reliability&#x2019; to describe that factor. As discussed in paragraphs BC2.28&#x2013;BC2.31, the Board did not reintroduce the term &#x2018;reliability&#x2019;. Paragraph 2.22 of the 2018 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> explains that if a high level of measurement uncertainty is involved in making an estimate, that may indicate that different information about the economic phenomenon might be more useful (see paragraphs BC2.55&#x2013;BC2.56). In addition, Chapter 6&#x2014;<i>Measurement</i> discusses how measurement uncertainty can affect the selection of a measurement basis.</p></body></paragraph>
