The Board&#x2019;s intention in establishing this principle was to emphasise that the statement of profit or loss is the default location for income and expenses. Thus, decisions to exclude any income and expenses from the statement of profit or loss and to include them in other comprehensive income can be made only in exceptional circumstances. Those exceptional circumstances would be when the Board concludes that requiring or permitting the exclusion of particular items of income or expenses from the statement of profit or loss would result in the statement of profit or loss providing more relevant information or providing a more faithful representation of an entity&#x2019;s financial performance for that period.</p></body></paragraph>
