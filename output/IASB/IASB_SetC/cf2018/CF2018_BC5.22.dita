They described this as an application of prudence (asymmetric prudence, applying the terminology used in paragraph BC2.37). The Board concluded that the level of measurement uncertainty beyond which a measure does not provide a faithful representation depends on facts and circumstances and so can be determined only when developing Standards (see paragraph 5.9). Paragraphs BC2.44&#x2013;BC2.45 provide further discussion of symmetry in decisions about recognition and measurement.</p></body></paragraph>
