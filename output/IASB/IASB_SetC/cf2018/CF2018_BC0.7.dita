On restarting the project in 2012, the Board decided to develop a complete set of proposals for a revised <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> instead of continuing with the phased approach. Developing the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> as a whole enabled the Board and stakeholders to see more clearly the links between different aspects of the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph>.</p></body></paragraph>
