The Board chose the phrase &#x2018;no practical ability to avoid&#x2019; because it most effectively conveys the need to identify what an entity is obliged to do, instead of focusing on the probable outcome. Furthermore, it mirrors the term &#x2018;practical ability&#x2019;, which is applied in some Standards in assessing whether an entity controls an asset, and the term &#x2018;present ability&#x2019; used for a similar purpose in paragraphs 4.20 and 4.22 of the 2018 <i>Conceptual Framework</i>.</p></body></paragraph>
