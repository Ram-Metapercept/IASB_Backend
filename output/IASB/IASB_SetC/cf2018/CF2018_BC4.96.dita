Presentation and disclosure are discussed in Chapter 7&#x2014;<i>Presentation and disclosure</i> of the 2018 <i>Conceptual Framework</i>. The rest of the discussion in the 2010 <i>Conceptual Framework</i> referred to various types of income and expenses, for example, revenue, gains and losses. That material was not included in the 2018 <i>Conceptual Framework</i>. The material was originally included to emphasise that income includes revenue and gains and that expenses include losses. The Board decided that that emphasis is now unnecessary and the implication that the <i>Conceptual Framework</i> defines subclasses of income and expenses is unhelpful. The Board does not expect the removal of that material to cause any changes in practice.</p></body></paragraph>
