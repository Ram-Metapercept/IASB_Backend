The Board will use the output from that project when it decides, in due course, whether to add to its active agenda a project to amend the relevant Standards, the <i>Conceptual Framework</i>, or both.

That guidance was not designed to help to distinguish liabilities from equity (see paragraph BC4.45).</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
