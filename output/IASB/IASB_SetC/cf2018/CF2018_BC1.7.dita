External was intended to convey that internal users such as management were not the intended beneficiaries for general purpose financial reporting as established by the Board. During redeliberations, the Board concluded that this term was redundant. Therefore, ChapterÂ 1 uses &#x2018;general purpose financial reporting&#x2019;.</p></body></paragraph>
