Although most respondents to the 2006 Discussion Paper agreed that providing useful information for decision-making was the appropriate objective, they said that investors, lenders and other creditors make other decisions that are aided by financial reporting information in addition to resource allocation decisions. For example, shareholders who vote on whether to retain directors or replace them, and on how members of management should be remunerated for their services, need information on which to base their decisions. Shareholders&#x2019; decision-making process may include evaluating how management of the entity performed against management in competing entities in similar circumstances.</p></body></paragraph>
