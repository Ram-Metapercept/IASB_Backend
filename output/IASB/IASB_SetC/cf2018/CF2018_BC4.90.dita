The inherent limitation of a binary distinction between liabilities and equity is that it attempts to make a single distinction between claims that have various characteristics in varying degrees. Eliminating that binary distinction and defining a single element for all claims would allow the accounting for each type of claim to be determined individually to depict its specific characteristics. However, unless all claims are measured directly, any approach would need to identify at least one residual class of claim that would be measured indirectly by reference to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. Moreover, it is not possible to measure all claims directly without valuing the entire entity, which goes beyond the stated objective of general purpose financial reports. Thus, dividing claims into at least two classes is unavoidable.</p></body></paragraph>
