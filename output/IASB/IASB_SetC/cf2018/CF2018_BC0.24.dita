In particular, they expressed concerns about proposed changes to the definitions of an asset and a liability. In response, the Board tested the revised definitions of an asset and a liability and the guidance supporting those definitions (see paragraphs BC4.19&#x2013;BC4.22). One of the aims of this test was to enable both the Board and stakeholders to assess implications of the revised concepts for future Standards. In addition, the Board tested for inconsistencies between the revised concepts and existing Standards.</p></body></paragraph>
