In the Board&#x2019;s view, it is possible for items to qualify for recognition on an individual basis and to be measured on a group basis. For example, a collection of items qualifying for recognition on an individual basis:</p><ol id="CF2018_L0127" base="F72807420" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="CF2018_P1286" base="SL72807583">could be measured as a single unit of account when estimating their recoverable amount; or</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="CF2018_P1287" base="SL72807584">may sometimes, as a practical expedient, be measured as a portfolio.</p></li></ol><p id="CF2018_P1288" base="F72807422">Hence, the Board concluded that sometimes it might be appropriate to select one unit of account for recognition and a different unit of account for measurement.</p></body></paragraph>
