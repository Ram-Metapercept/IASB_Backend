In developing these chapters, the Board and the FASB published a Discussion Paper in 2006 (2006 Discussion Paper) and an Exposure Draft in 2008 (2008 Exposure Draft).<xref keyref="footnotes/CF2018_FN0019" type="fn"/> After considering feedback on those documents and information gained from outreach, in 2010 the Board and the FASB issued two chapters of a revised <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting</ph></ph> (2010 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph>). The chapters on the objective of general purpose financial reporting and qualitative characteristics of useful financial information came into effect as soon as they were issued. The remaining text of the 1989 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph> was carried forward to the 2010 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> unchanged.</p></body></paragraph>
