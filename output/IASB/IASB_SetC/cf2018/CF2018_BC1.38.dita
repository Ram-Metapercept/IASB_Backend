One example of a decision about such actions is a decision in voting on the membership of the Board of directors. That vote will ultimately influence the Board of directors&#x2019; subsequent actions affecting the use of the entity&#x2019;s economic resources. However, financial reporting is not designed to provide information that will help the primary users of that information to exercise their rights to vote on other actions by management, such as developing a statement on an issue of a public policy that does not directly affect the use of the entity&#x2019;s economic resources.</p></body></paragraph>
