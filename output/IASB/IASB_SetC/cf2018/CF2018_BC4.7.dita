It emphasises more clearly that an asset (or liability) is an economic resource (or obligation) and that it is not the ultimate inflow (or outflow) of economic benefits that the economic resource (or obligation) may produce. This approach also streamlines the definitions and shows more clearly the parallels between assets and liabilities.</p></body></paragraph>
