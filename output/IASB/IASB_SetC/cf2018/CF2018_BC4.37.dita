That right exists momentarily until the goods or services are consumed, at which point the consumption is recognised as an expense. This is consistent with <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRSÂ 2</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Share-based Payment</ph></ph>, which treats employees&#x2019; services received as an asset that is immediately consumed.</p></body></paragraph>
