Some respondents to the 2013 Discussion Paper suggested that the term &#x2018;economic resource&#x2019; is too limiting and would cover only resources that have a market value. The Board intended that the term &#x2018;economic resource&#x2019; cover all resources that have the potential to produce economic benefits rather than be limited to resources for which a market currently exists. The Board chose the term &#x2018;economic resource&#x2019; because it helps to emphasise that the resource in question is not, for example, a physical object, but rights over a physical object, as discussed in paragraphs 4.11&#x2013;4.12 of the 2018 <i>Conceptual Framework</i>.</p></body></paragraph>
