The responses both to the 2013 Discussion Paper and the 2015 Exposure Draft seemed to confirm that many respondents continue to equate the word &#x2018;reliability&#x2019; with a tolerable level of measurement uncertainty, not with the qualitative characteristic described in the 1989 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph>. Hence, the Board retained the term &#x2018;faithful representation&#x2019; as the label for the qualitative characteristic previously called &#x2018;reliability&#x2019;. However, to address concerns that the 2010 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> did not adequately discuss the role of measurement uncertainty in financial reporting, the Board included in the 2018 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> a discussion of how measurement uncertainty affects the usefulness of financial information (see paragraphs 2.19, 2.22 and BC2.46&#x2013;BC2.49). Furthermore, the 2018 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> discusses the role of measurement uncertainty in decisions about recognition and measurement (see paragraphs 5.19&#x2013;5.23 and 6.60).</p></body></paragraph>
