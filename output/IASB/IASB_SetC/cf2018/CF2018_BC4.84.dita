It follows that for an executory contract, the terms of the contract provide for only one outcome&#x2014;the exchange will occur unless both parties agree to terminate the contract. Moreover, the entity&#x2019;s right and obligation to exchange economic resources are so interdependent that they cannot be separated. Hence, the contract cannot be separated into more than a single asset or liability. If the exchange is on terms that are currently favourable to the reporting entity, the contract is an asset; if it is on terms that are currently unfavourable, it is a liability.</p></body></paragraph>
