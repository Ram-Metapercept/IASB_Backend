That would be the case if the obligation is a present obligation that has arisen as a result of the past events discussed in paragraphs BC4.64&#x2013;BC4.68. Such obligations are sometimes referred to as &#x2018;stand-ready obligations&#x2019;. The 2018 <i>Conceptual Framework</i> does not use that term because the Board considered it unnecessary.</p></body></paragraph>
