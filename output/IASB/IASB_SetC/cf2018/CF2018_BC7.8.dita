The Board also introduced the term &#x2018;other comprehensive income&#x2019; at that point. That term refers to income and expenses not included in the statement of profit of loss. Some respondents suggested that the term &#x2018;other comprehensive income&#x2019; is neither particularly descriptive nor well understood by users of financial statements. Nonetheless, the Board concluded that avoiding the use of that term or using a different term could be confusing. Hence, the 2018 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> uses that term.</p></body></paragraph>
