Some respondents to the 2013 Discussion Paper expressed a concern that the term &#x2018;risk&#x2019; was not explicitly defined. Hence, they argued that &#x2018;information about risks&#x2019; could be understood to include almost any type of information, including information that would be best reported outside financial statements. Indeed, some argued that the information about how an entity manages risks belongs outside financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
