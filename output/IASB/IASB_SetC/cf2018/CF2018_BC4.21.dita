These examples included rights and obligations that meet the definitions of an asset or a liability but have a low probability of inflows or outflows of economic benefits or have highly uncertain outcomes. The analysis of those examples explained not only why an asset or liability exists, but also why, applying the recognition criteria in Chapter 5, that asset or liability would not necessarily be recognised in the financial statements. The examples also included transactions for which respondents to the 2015 Exposure Draft thought the implications of the proposed definitions and supporting guidance were unclear and were possibly inconsistent with requirements in Standards. The analysis of those examples illustrated how and why applying the proposed definitions and supporting guidance could, in many cases, lead to conclusions consistent with the requirements in the Standards.</p></body></paragraph>
