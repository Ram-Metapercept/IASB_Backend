Accordingly, paragraph 3.12 of the 2018 <i>Conceptual Framework</i> acknowledges the concept of combined financial statements. However, the 2018 <i>Conceptual Framework</i> does not discuss when or how entities could prepare combined financial statements. The Board concluded that such discussion would be best developed if the Board decides in the future to develop a Standard on this topic.</p></body></paragraph>
