For loans given or received, if interest is receivable or payable regularly, the amortised cost of the loan typically approximates the amount originally paid or received. In addition, the carrying amount of a loan given is reduced if it is impaired. Therefore, the 2018 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> categorises amortised cost of financial assets and financial liabilities as a form of historical cost.</p></body></paragraph>
