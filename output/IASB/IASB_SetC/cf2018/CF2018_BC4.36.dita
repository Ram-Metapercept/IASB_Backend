Instead, the 2018 <i>Conceptual Framework</i> explains that the term &#x2018;right&#x2019; captures not merely rights obtained by contract, legislation and similar means, but also rights obtained in other ways, for example, by acquiring or creating know-how that is not in the public domain. ParagraphÂ 4.22 further explains why the entity could control the right to use such know-how even if that know-how is not protected by a registered patent. This explanation of the concept is not new&#x2014;it builds on material in paragraph 4.12 of the 2010 <i>Conceptual Framework</i>.</p></body></paragraph>
