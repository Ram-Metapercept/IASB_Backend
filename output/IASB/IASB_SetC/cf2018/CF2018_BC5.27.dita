If an entity transfers an entire asset or an entire liability and retains no exposure to that asset or liability, the control approach and the risks-and-rewards approach both lead to the same outcome. Moreover, in such cases, achieving both aims described in paragraph BC5.26 is straightforward.</p></body></paragraph>
