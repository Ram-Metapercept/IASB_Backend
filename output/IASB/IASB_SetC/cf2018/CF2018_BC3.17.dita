In particular, they were concerned that a reporting entity that is a portion of an entity could choose to report on an incomplete set of economic activities, for example, by excluding from its financial statements the reporting entity&#x2019;s share of overheads. In addition, there may be difficulties in identifying which claims should be included in financial statements if the reporting entity is a portion of an entity.</p></body></paragraph>
