To be useful to the Board, the <i>Conceptual Framework</i> needs to give guidance on how to approach decisions about setting recognition requirements in Standards. A presumption or overarching principle that every item meeting the definition of an asset or a liability should be recognised would be too restrictive and would not provide such guidance.</p></body></paragraph>
