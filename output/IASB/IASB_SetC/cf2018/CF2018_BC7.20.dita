Nevertheless, the 2018 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> introduces for the first time guidance on when it might be appropriate for the Board to include income or expenses in other comprehensive income. The Board concluded that introducing guidance on this topic was a significant improvement.</p></body></paragraph>
