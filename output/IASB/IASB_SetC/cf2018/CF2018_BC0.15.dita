The Board is exploring how to distinguish liabilities from equity in its research project on Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Equity. If necessary, the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> will be updated as one possible outcome of that project (see paragraphÂ BC4.45).</p></body></paragraph>
