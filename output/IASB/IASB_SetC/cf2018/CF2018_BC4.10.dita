However, &#x2018;capable of&#x2019; is already used in the discussion of relevance in paragraphs 2.6&#x2013;2.7 of the 2018 <i>Conceptual Framework</i>. It could be confusing to use the term &#x2018;capable&#x2019; with one meaning describing what information is relevant and with a different meaning in defining an economic resource. To avoid such confusion, the Board introduced the phrase &#x2018;has the potential to&#x2019; in the definition of an economic resource.</p></body></paragraph>
