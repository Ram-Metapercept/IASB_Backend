These respondents argued that:</p><ol id="CF2018_L0115" base="F72807066" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="CF2018_P1210" base="SL72807249">some assets, for example, tangible assets, are best described as resources instead of rights. The concept of accounting for tangible assets as a set of rights is inconsistent with practice, they argued, especially when that concept is combined with the idea of &#x2018;unbundling&#x2019; rights and recognising them as separate assets.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="CF2018_P1211" base="SL72807250">unless the <i>Conceptual Framework</i> explains what factors drive the identification of the unit of account, it would be difficult to explain consistently for a single asset comprising several rights whether to recognise that single asset as a whole or to recognise some of those rights separately.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="CF2018_P1212" base="SL72807251">a focus on rights within a larger set of rights would put more pressure on the recognition and derecognition criteria and the unit of account. Entities would need to ask themselves numerous questions in order to confirm whether new assets or liabilities exist, without providing any clear benefit to users of financial statements. These respondents argued that the rights approach has caused challenges in developing Standards and also in applying them, particularly in relation to derecognition decisions.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
