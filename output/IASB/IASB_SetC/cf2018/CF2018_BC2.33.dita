The Board did not intend to imply such a change. Accordingly, to avoid any further misunderstandings and to highlight the Board&#x2019;s intention, the Board reinstated in paragraphÂ 2.12 of the 2018 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> an explicit reference to the need to faithfully represent the substance of an economic phenomenon. The Board explained further how to provide a faithful representation of the substance of contractual rights and contractual obligations in paragraphs 4.59&#x2013;4.62 of the 2018 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph>.</p></body></paragraph>
