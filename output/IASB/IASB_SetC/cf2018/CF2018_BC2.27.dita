Some said that the Board could have better explained what reliable means rather than replacing the term. However, many respondents who made those comments assigned a different meaning to reliability from what the Board meant. In particular, many respondents&#x2019; descriptions of reliability more closely resembled the Board&#x2019;s notion of verifiability than its notion of reliability. Those comments led the Board to affirm its decision to replace the term &#x2018;reliability&#x2019; with &#x2018;faithful representation&#x2019;.</p></body></paragraph>
