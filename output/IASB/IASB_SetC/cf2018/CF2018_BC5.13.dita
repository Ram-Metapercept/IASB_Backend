The Board concluded that it is helpful to consider existence uncertainty separately from outcome uncertainty and separately from measurement uncertainty. Although existence uncertainty may contribute to outcome uncertainty and measurement uncertainty, conceptually it is different and could affect recognition decisions differently. Distinguishing different types of uncertainty makes it easier to decide what information is most likely to be relevant to users of financial statements and how to provide that information in a way that provides a faithful representation.</p></body></paragraph>
