The Board identified three views applied at that time in Standards to determine when a present obligation to transfer an economic resource has arisen:</p><ol id="CF2018_L0121" base="F72807329" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="CF2018_P1247" base="SL72807568">View 1&#x2014;an entity must have no ability to avoid the future transfer. For example, <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 37</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets</ph></ph>, as it had been interpreted in <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRIC 21</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Levies</ph></ph>, required that for a present obligation to exist, the entity must have no ability, even in theory, to avoid the future transfer.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="CF2018_P1248" base="SL72807569">View 2&#x2014;an entity must have no practical ability to avoid the future transfer. For example, <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 34</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Interim Financial Reporting</ph></ph> specified that, if a lease provides for variable lease payments based on the entity achieving a specified level of annual sales, an obligation can arise before that level has been achieved if that level is expected to be achieved and the entity therefore has no realistic alternative but to make the future lease payments.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="CF2018_P1249" base="SL72807570">View 3&#x2014;there need be no limits on an entity&#x2019;s ability to avoid the future transfer. It is sufficient that, as a consequence of a past event, the entity may have to transfer an economic resource if further conditions are met. For example, <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 19</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Employee Benefits</ph></ph> required a liability to be recognised for benefits that are conditional on future employment (unvested benefits) if those benefits are given in exchange for service already provided by employees. IAS 19 did not require an entity to assess whether it has the practical ability to avoid paying those benefits.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
