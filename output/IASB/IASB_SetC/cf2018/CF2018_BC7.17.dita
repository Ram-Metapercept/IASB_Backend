However, on the basis of its previous work the Board concluded that no single characteristic, or small number of characteristics, is shared by all items included in the statement of profit or loss but not shared by items that are most appropriately included in other comprehensive income. Consequently, the Board concluded that it is not possible to produce a robust conceptual definition of profit or loss or of other comprehensive income.</p></body></paragraph>
