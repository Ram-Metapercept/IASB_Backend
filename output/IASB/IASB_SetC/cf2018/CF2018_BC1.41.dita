That assessment enables users of financial statements to hold management to account for its actions. The Board&#x2019;s use of the term &#x2018;stewardship&#x2019; is consistent with the general understanding of that term: the careful and responsible management of something entrusted to one&#x2019;s care.<xref keyref="footnotes/CF2018_FN0030" type="fn"/> These improvements to Chapter 1 provide increased clarity and the Board concluded that this outweighs the translation difficulties identified in 2010.</p></body></paragraph>
