For example, some information about a subsidiary&#x2019;s assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses may be material to the financial statements of the subsidiary, but may not be material to the consolidated financial statements of the parent. The subsidiary&#x2019;s own financial statements are designed to provide the primary users of its financial statements with information about the subsidiary&#x2019;s assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses.</p></body></paragraph>
