The Board concluded that it had made significant progress in developing high-level guidance on presentation of income and expenses and that this guidance would help the Board to develop presentation requirements in Standards. Hence, the Board decided to include such guidance in the 2018 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph>, rather than to explore the use of the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income in a separate project. That decision will not preclude further work on reporting financial performance.</p></body></paragraph>
