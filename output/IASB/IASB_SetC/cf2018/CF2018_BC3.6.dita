The Board does not view that information as less important than information provided in the statement of financial position and the statement(s) of financial performance. Nevertheless, the 2018 <i>Conceptual Framework</i> refers only to those statements because only those statements provide a summary of recognised elements&#x2014;assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses. In addition, it is necessary to identify those statements as the place where recognition occurs because otherwise it would not be possible to describe recognition clearly. In contrast, because cash inflows and cash outflows and contributions from holders of equity claims and distributions to them are not elements of financial statements, statements providing information about those items do not provide a summary of recognised elements.</p></body></paragraph>
