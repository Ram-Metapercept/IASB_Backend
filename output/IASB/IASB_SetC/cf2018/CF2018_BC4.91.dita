However, the Board concluded that introducing another element would make the classification and resulting accounting more complex. In addition, it would be necessary to determine whether changes in this third class of claim should meet the definition of income or expenses. An outcome similar to introducing a new element could instead be achieved by separately presenting different classes within liabilities or within equity.</p></body></paragraph>
