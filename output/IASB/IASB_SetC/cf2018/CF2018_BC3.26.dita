The 2010 Exposure Draft stated that joint control and significant influence do not give rise to control. The Board still agrees with that conclusion, but sees no need to embed the notions of joint control and significant influence in the <i>Conceptual Framework</i>. Hence, the 2018 <i>Conceptual Framework</i> does not refer to these notions. In developing the 2018 <i>Conceptual Framework</i>, the Board did not discuss whether these notions should continue to play a role in standard-setting.</p></body></paragraph>
