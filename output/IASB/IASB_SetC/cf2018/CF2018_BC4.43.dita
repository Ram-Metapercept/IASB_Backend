The Board agreed that this is implicit in the definition of an economic resource but decided that explicitly referring to control is a helpful way of structuring the definition and supporting guidance.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="CF2018_P1230" base="SL72807255">a suggestion that the requirement for control to exist should be a recognition criterion, instead of part of the definition of an asset. A few stakeholders argued that this approach would separate two questions that are independent of each other (namely: does an asset exist? and to whom does the asset belong?). The Board did not move the reference to control into the asset recognition criteria because such a move would be unlikely to change which assets would be recognised and because the Board has identified no problems in practice that would be addressed by such a move.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="CF2018_P1231" base="SL72807256">a suggestion that the Board should amend the definition of control to refer to &#x2018;substantially all&#x2019; economic benefits. The Board noted that the reference to &#x2018;substantially all&#x2019; economic benefits would be redundant, and possibly confusing, if an entity recognises only the rights it controls. For example, if an entity controls the right to obtain 20% of the economic benefits from a building, its asset is the right to obtain 20% of the economic benefits from the building. The entity would not need the right to obtain all, or even substantially all, the economic benefits from the building because its asset is not a right over the whole building. The question of whether to include a threshold such as &#x2018;substantially all&#x2019; may arise when developing Standards, for example, if a Standard requires an entity to account for a group of rights as a single asset (a single unit of account).</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
