However, paragraphÂ 12 explicitly stated that the objective of financial statements is to provide information &#x2018;that is useful to a wide range of users in making economic decisions.&#x2019; Thus, the 1989 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph> focused on investors&#x2019; needs as representative of the needs of a wide range of users but did not explicitly identify a group of primary users.</p></body></paragraph>
