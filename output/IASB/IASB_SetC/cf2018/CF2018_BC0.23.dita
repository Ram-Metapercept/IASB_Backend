The Board disagreed with this view. In some circumstances, the Board might need to depart from aspects of the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph>. It is helpful for the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> to acknowledge this, and to specify that such departures are appropriate only if needed to meet the objective of general purpose financial reporting. That need might arise because conceptual thinking or the economic environment may change, and new or revised Standards might need to reflect these changes.</p></body></paragraph>
