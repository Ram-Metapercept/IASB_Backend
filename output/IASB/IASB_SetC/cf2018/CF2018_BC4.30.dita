It is equally true that ownership of a physical object arises because of rights conferred by law. Furthermore, although they differ in extent, the rights conferred by full legal ownership of a physical object and by a contract to use an object for 99% (or 50% or even 1%) of its useful life are all rights of one kind or another. In addition, because of legal differences or changes, a particular set of rights may constitute full legal ownership in one jurisdiction but not in another jurisdiction, or at one date but not at another date.</p></body></paragraph>
