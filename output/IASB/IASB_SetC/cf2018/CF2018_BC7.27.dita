The differences between these requirements arose because the Board had taken different approaches to the issue at different times. Sometimes, the Board&#x2019;s approach was to view the statement(s) of financial performance as a single performance statement so that each item of income or expenses should appear only once in that statement. To be consistent with that approach, the Board generally prohibited reclassification in Standards it developed at those times. At other times, the Board&#x2019;s approach was that all income and expenses should be included in the statement of profit or loss at some point. To achieve that objective, reclassification would be necessary.</p></body></paragraph>
