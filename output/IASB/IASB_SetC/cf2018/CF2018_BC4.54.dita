Applying the criterion of &#x2018;no practical ability to avoid&#x2019; will require judgement. Some stakeholders were concerned that allowing preparers of financial statements to apply this criterion would lead to diverse practice and that in some circumstances entities would recognise a liability when, in the view of some of those stakeholders, the entity does not have a genuine obligation. However, the Board noted that preparers of financial statements will rarely be required to apply that criterion without further requirements and guidance. The Board will, if necessary, develop guidance on applying that criterion to particular cases as it develops Standards.</p></body></paragraph>
