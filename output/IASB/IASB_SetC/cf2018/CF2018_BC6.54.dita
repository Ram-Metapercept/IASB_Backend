Measuring some classes of equity, or some components of equity, directly does not contradict that definition and differs from measuring total equity directly. Even if some individual classes or components of equity are measured directly, total equity will continue to equal the total of the carrying amounts of all recognised assets minus the total of the carrying amounts of all recognised liabilities. Consequently, if an entity has more than one class of equity or more than one component of equity, at least one of them is measured as a residual.</p></body></paragraph>
