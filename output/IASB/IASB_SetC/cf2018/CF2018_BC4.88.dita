The 2018 <i>Conceptual Framework</i> includes concepts for reporting the substance of contractual rights and contractual obligations. Those concepts drew on concepts developed by the Board in standard-setting projects. The Board decided that including the underlying concepts in the 2018 <i>Conceptual Framework</i> would help to ensure that these concepts are applied more consistently in Standards.</p></body></paragraph>
