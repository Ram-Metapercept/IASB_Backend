A few respondents to the 2015 Exposure Draft suggested that this description should also refer to the statement of cash flows and the statement of changes in equity. They argued that making explicit references only to the statement of financial position and the statement(s) of financial performance could be interpreted as implying that these two statements are more important than statements providing information about cash flows or about contributions from holders of equity claims and distributions to those holders.</p></body></paragraph>
