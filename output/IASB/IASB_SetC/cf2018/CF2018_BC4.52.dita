That omission would place too much emphasis on legal form and not enough weight on faithfully representing the substance of obligations that are, in practice, as binding as obligations that are legally enforceable. Moreover, if an entity has a theoretical right to take action that would avoid an obligation, but has no practical ability to exercise that right, that obligation binds the entity as effectively as if it did not have that theoretical right.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="CF2018_P1252" base="SL72807572">the Board rejected View 3 because the term &#x2018;obligation&#x2019; implies some limit on the entity&#x2019;s ability to avoid the transfer of an economic resource.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
