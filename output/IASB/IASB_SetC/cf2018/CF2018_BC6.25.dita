In those Standards, value in use is used in determining the recoverable amount of an asset that is measured at historical cost and may be impaired. Within that context, if value in use is used to determine the recoverable amount of an impaired asset, immediately after the impairment loss has been recognised, the carrying amount of the asset equals its value in use. Nevertheless, the 2018 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> identifies value in use as a separate measurement basis because: </p><ol id="CF2018_L0150" base="F72806683" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="CF2018_P1424" base="F72806684">it differs conceptually from historical cost, even though value in use is used in determining recoverable historical cost; and</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="CF2018_P1425" base="F72806686">the Board might decide that in some circumstances an entity should measure an asset using an entity-specific current value (ieÂ value in use) instead of fair value.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
