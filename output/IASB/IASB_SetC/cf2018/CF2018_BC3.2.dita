Moreover, addressing issues related to other forms of financial reporting could have substantially delayed completion of the 2018 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph>, thus delaying the improvements it brought. Consequently, Chapters 3&#x2013;8 of the 2018 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> focus on information provided in financial statements and do not address other forms of financial reporting, for example, management commentary, interim financial reports, press releases and supplementary material provided for analysis.<xref keyref="footnotes/CF2018_FN0035" type="fn"/></p></body></paragraph>
