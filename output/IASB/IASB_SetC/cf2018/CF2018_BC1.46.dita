The chapter uses the phrase &#x2018;the entity&#x2019;s economic resources and the claims against the reporting entity&#x2019; (see paragraphÂ 1.12). The reason for the change is that in many cases, claims against an entity are not claims on specific resources. In addition, many claims will be satisfied using resources that will result from future net cash inflows. Thus, while all claims are claims against the entity, not all are claims against the entity&#x2019;s existing resources.</p></body></paragraph>
