This objective is to provide useful information to existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors rather than to provide information to a particular subset of those capital providers. If information were to be directed towards the needs of a particular subset of primary users, it might be necessary to provide different sets of financial statements for each subset. That could cause confusion and undermine confidence in financial reporting. In addition, as mentioned in paragraph BC1.6, providing different reports for different subsets of primary users could be expensive.</p></body></paragraph>
