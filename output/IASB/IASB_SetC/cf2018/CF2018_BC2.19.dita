However, some respondents to the 2008 Exposure Draft agreed that although materiality is pervasive, it is not a constraint on a reporting entity&#x2019;s ability to report information. Rather, materiality is an aspect of relevance, because immaterial information does not affect a user&#x2019;s decision. Furthermore, a standard-setter does not consider materiality when developing standards because it is an entity-specific consideration. The boards agreed with those views and concluded that materiality is an aspect of relevance that applies at the individual entity level.</p></body></paragraph>
