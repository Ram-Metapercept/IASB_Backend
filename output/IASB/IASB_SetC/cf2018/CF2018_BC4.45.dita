The Board is exploring how to distinguish liabilities from equity in its research project on Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Equity. If necessary, the <i>Conceptual Framework</i> will be updated as one possible outcome of that project. In finalising the 2018 <i>Conceptual Framework</i>, the Board sought not to add new concepts and new guidance that it may need to revisit after that research project.</p></body></paragraph>
