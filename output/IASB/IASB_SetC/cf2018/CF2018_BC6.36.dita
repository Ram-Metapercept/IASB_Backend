Some respondents to the 2015 Exposure Draft stated that the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> should give more weight to the effect that a particular measure would have on the statement(s) of financial performance. In their view, the statement(s) of financial performance is more useful than the statement of financial position to users of financial statements. However, the Board concluded that the relative importance of the information produced in those statements will depend on how users will use the resulting information in their analysis, which will, in turn, depend on facts and circumstances.</p></body></paragraph>
