This interpretation of faithful representation would allow the recognition of items that cannot be measured reliably. Consequently, the qualitative characteristic of faithful representation does not act as an effective filter when identifying the types of information to be included in financial statements.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="CF2018_P1022" base="F72025053">the 1989 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph> acknowledged a trade-off between the qualitative characteristics of relevance and reliability. More relevant information may lack reliability and more reliable information may lack relevance. Some respondents expressed the view that this trade-off was missing in the 2010 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> (see paragraphs BC2.52&#x2013;BC2.57).</p></li><li><li_value>(d)</li_value> <p id="CF2018_P1023" base="F72025056">the idea that financial statements should be credible, that is, that users need assurance that they can depend on financial statements to faithfully represent what they purport to represent, is a key concept that should be acknowledged in the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph>. Treating that concept solely as an enhancing qualitative characteristic (verifiability, see paragraphs BC2.60&#x2013;BC2.62) gives it too little weight.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
