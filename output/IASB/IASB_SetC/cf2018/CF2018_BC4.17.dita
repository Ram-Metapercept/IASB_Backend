Moreover, by identifying the past event, an entity can determine how to report that event in its financial statements; for example, how to classify and present income, expenses or cash flows arising from that event. Paragraphs BC4.64&#x2013;BC4.68 discuss why the phrase &#x2018;as a result of past events&#x2019; is particularly important to the revised definition of a liability. Hence, the Board retained that phrase in the definitions.</p></body></paragraph>
