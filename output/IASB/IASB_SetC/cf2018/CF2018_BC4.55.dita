This is intended to mean not just that it would be economically advantageous to make the transfer. Rather, the adverse economic consequences of not making the transfer are so severe that the entity has no practical ability to avoid the transfer. Although the entity has the theoretical right to avoid the transfer, it has no practical ability to exercise that right.</p></body></paragraph>
