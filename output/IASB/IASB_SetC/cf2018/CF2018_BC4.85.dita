Trade date accounting treats the financial asset as having already been delivered at the commitment (trade) date, instead of accounting for the purchase or sale contract as a derivative until settlement. IFRS 9 permits trade date accounting as a simple and practical method of managing and recording transactions that have only a short duration. In other words, permitting this method results from considering the cost constraint&#x2014;from considering the relative costs and benefits of trade date accounting and settlement date accounting (the other method permitted by IFRS 9).</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
