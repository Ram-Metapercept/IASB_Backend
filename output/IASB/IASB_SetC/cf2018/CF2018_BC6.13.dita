The 2018 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> does not do so because the Board concluded that cash-flow-based measurements are not measurement bases in their own right. Instead, cash-flow-based measurement techniques can be used to estimate a measure in applying a specified measurement basis. Paragraphs 6.91&#x2013;6.95 of the 2018 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> discuss how those techniques can be used in this way.</p></body></paragraph>
