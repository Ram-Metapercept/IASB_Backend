It also introduced a definition of control. The Board built that definition on the definitions of control in <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 15</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Revenue from Contracts with Customers</ph></ph>, which defines control of an asset, and in <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 10</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Consolidated Financial Statements</ph></ph>, which defines control of an entity.<xref keyref="footnotes/CF2018_FN0037" type="fn"/> Although the definitions in these Standards differ, they are based on the same basic concepts&#x2014;that the entity has the ability to direct the use of the asset (or of the entity) and to obtain economic benefits (or returns). The 2018 <i>Conceptual Framework</i> uses the concept of control both in the definition of an asset and in its description of a parent&#x2019;s control of its subsidiaries.</p></body></paragraph>
