In many cases in current practice, an asset or liability is not recognised for an executory contract. The Board expects that this will continue to be so. The same measurement considerations that apply to all other assets and liabilities (see Chapter 6&#x2014;<i>Measurement</i>) apply also to the single asset or liability that arises from an executory contract. When a historical cost measurement basis is applied to an executory contract, the contract is typically measured at zero (which has the same practical effect as not recognising the contract) unless it is onerous. For example, the historical cost of an executory contract for the purchase of inventories is zero (assuming no transaction costs) unless the contract is onerous.</p></body></paragraph>
