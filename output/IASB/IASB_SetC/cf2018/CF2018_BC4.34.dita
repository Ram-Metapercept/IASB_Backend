IAS 38 states that an asset is identifiable if it either is separable from the entity, or arises from contractual or other legal rights. Therefore, in developing the 2018 <i>Conceptual Framework</i>, the Board discussed whether the definition of an asset should require an asset to be identifiable and whether that definition should require an asset to be separable. The Board concluded that if an asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights, it is likely to be easier to identify, measure and describe the asset. This may affect whether recognising the asset would provide relevant information and whether it is possible to represent it faithfully. However, the Board concluded that identifiability and separability should not form part of the definition of an asset.</p></body></paragraph>
