Hence, the Board did not amend that description of materiality, except to clarify that the users mentioned in the description are the primary users of general purpose financial reports, as described in paragraphÂ 1.5 of the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph>. This clarification emphasises that decisions about materiality are intended to reflect the needs of the primary users, not the needs of any other group.</p></body></paragraph>
