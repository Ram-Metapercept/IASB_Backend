Applying this concept, an entity may have an obligation if only some of the events in the chain have occurred: an entity could have an obligation if it has no practical ability to avoid the events that have not yet occurred. Therefore, it is important to explain which of the events in the chain must have occurred for an entity to have a present obligation &#x2018;as a result of past events&#x2019;.</p></body></paragraph>
