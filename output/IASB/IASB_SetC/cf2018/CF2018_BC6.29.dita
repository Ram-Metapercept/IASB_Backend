The deprival value of an asset is the loss that an entity would suffer if it were deprived of the asset being measured. Similarly, the relief value of a liability is the benefit that an entity would enjoy if it were relieved of the liability being measured. The Board did not include a discussion of deprival value or relief value because they are more complex than other measurement bases and have been used in few jurisdictions. Hence, the Board concluded that it is unlikely to use deprival value or relief value when developing Standards.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="CF2018_P1431" base="F72806720">net realisable value. Net realisable value depicts the estimated consideration from the sale of the asset reduced by the estimated costs of sale. The Board concluded that it is unnecessary to describe net realisable value separately, because it is derived from another current measure.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="CF2018_P1432" base="F72806722">cost of release. Cost of release depicts the estimated cost (including transaction costs) of obtaining release from a liability by negotiation with the counterparty. Because it is relatively unusual for entities to obtain release from liabilities, instead of fulfilling them, the Board concluded that it is unnecessary to describe this measurement basis in the 2018 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph>.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
