Thus, the nature of an entity&#x2019;s business activities is considered in selecting a measurement basis for an asset or liability and for related income and expenses. Moreover, in some cases, considering the nature of an entity&#x2019;s activities may lead to some items of income and expenses being included in other comprehensive income (see paragraphs 6.85&#x2013;6.86). The Board concluded that the discussion on this factor in the 2018 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> provides sufficient tools for the Board to make appropriate standard-setting decisions if future projects consider how to account for the long-term investments of entities whose business activities include long-term investment or for their liabilities.</p></body></paragraph>
