Amending a Standard is not an automatic consequence of that revision. Changes to Standards are made to address deficiencies in financial reporting. Any changes to the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> that highlight inconsistencies in the Standards must be considered by the Board in the light of other priorities when developing its work plan.<xref keyref="footnotes/CF2018_FN0022" type="fn"/></p></body></paragraph>
