The 2018 <i>Conceptual Framework</i> uses the term &#x2018;economic resource&#x2019; and defines an economic resource and, hence, an asset as a right. To illustrate the effect of this change in emphasis, the 2018 <i>Conceptual Framework</i> states that, for a physical object, such as an item of property, plant and equipment, the economic resource is not the physical object but a set of rights over that object. Examples of such rights are listed in paragraph 4.11.</p></body></paragraph>
