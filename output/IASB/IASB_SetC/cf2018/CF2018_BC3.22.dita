As stated in paragraph 3.2, the objective of financial statements is to provide useful financial information to primary users of those financial statements. In the case of consolidated financial statements, the information needs of primary users may differ depending on whether their focus is on the parent (see paragraphs BC3.23&#x2013;BC3.24) or on the subsidiaries (see paragraph BC3.25).</p></body></paragraph>
