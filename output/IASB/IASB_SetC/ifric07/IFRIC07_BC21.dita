This was because deferred tax items are determined by the assets&#x2019; (and liabilities&#x2019;) relative carrying amounts and tax bases. However, some respondents to D5 objected to that view, for various reasons. Some argued that deferred tax items, by nature, are received or paid in a fixed or determinable number of units of currency, and so should be considered as monetary items in accordance with <xref id="IFRIC07_X0085" base="SL210995" href="../ias21/IAS21_8.dita#IAS21_8">paragraph 8 of IAS 21</xref>. Others noted that general practice is to classify deferred taxes as non&#x2011;monetary items.</p></body></paragraph>
