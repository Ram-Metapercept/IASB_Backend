In other words, the deferred tax items in the opening balance sheet for the reporting period in which an entity identifies the existence of hyperinflation should be calculated as if the environment had always been hyperinflationary, ie option (c) in <xref id="IFRIC07_X0087" base="SL210997" href="IFRIC07_BC20.dita#IFRIC07_BC20">paragraph BC20</xref>. Although the IFRIC acknowledged that deferred tax items may meet the definition of monetary items it noted that the purposes of option (c) would not be achieved if opening deferred tax items were restated in the same manner as applied generally for monetary items.</p></body></paragraph>
