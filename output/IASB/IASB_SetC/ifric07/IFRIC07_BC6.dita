Consequently, the opening balance sheet should be restated to reflect the change in a general price index for the reporting period only and not for changes in a general price index before the beginning of the reporting period, even though some balance sheet items may have been acquired or assumed before that date. However, the IFRIC also noted that <xref id="IFRIC07_X0052" base="SL210977" href="../ias29/IAS29_34.dita#IAS29_34">paragraph 34 of IAS 29</xref> requires:</p><lq> <p id="IFRIC07_P0435" base="SL137324"><i>Corresponding figures for the previous reporting period</i>, whether they were based on a historical cost approach or a current cost approach, are restated by applying a general price index so that the comparative financial statements are <i>presented in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period</i>. Information that is disclosed in respect of earlier periods is also expressed in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period ... [emphasis added]</p></lq></body></paragraph>
