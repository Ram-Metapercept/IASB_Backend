Some respondents to D5 believed this was inconsistent. This is because <xref base="SL210992" href="../ias08/IAS08_16.dita#IAS08_16" id="IFRIC07_X0076">IAS 8 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors</ph></ph>, paragraph 16</xref>, states that a change in circumstances is not a change in accounting policy and an entity would not apply IAS 29 retrospectively. However, the IFRIC observed that IAS 29 contains specific requirements on this point, as noted in <xref base="SL210993" href="IFRIC07_BC5.dita#IFRIC07_BC5" id="IFRIC07_X0079">paragraphs BC5&#x2013;BC16</xref> above. The IFRIC concluded that the opening balance sheet for the reporting period in which an entity identifies the existence of hyperinflation ought to be restated as if the entity had always applied the restatement approach under IAS 29. The IFRIC reconfirmed its view that this treatment is similar to the retrospective application of a change in accounting policy described in <xref base="F400071" href="../ias08/IAS08_TOC.dita" id="IFRIC07_X0081">IAS 8</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
