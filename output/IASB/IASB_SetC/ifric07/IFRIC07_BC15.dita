The IFRIC noted that a change in functional currency is a change in the currency that is normally used to determine the pricing of an entity&#x2019;s transactions. As clarified in <xref id="IFRIC07_X0070" base="SL210986" href="IFRIC07_BC5.dita#IFRIC07_BC5">paragraph BC5</xref> above, the purpose of restatement for the effects of hyperinflation is to reflect the effect of changes in purchasing power in the economy of an entity&#x2019;s functional currency. Therefore, the IFRIC did not believe that the application of accounting for hyperinflation should be based on the accounting for the change in an entity&#x2019;s functional currency.</p></body></paragraph>
