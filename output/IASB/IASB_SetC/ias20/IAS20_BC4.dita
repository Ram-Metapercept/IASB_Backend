It believed that the imputation of interest provides more relevant information to a user of the financial statements. Accordingly the Board amended IAS 20 to require that loans received from a government that have a below&#x2011;market rate of interest should be recognised and measured in accordance with <xref base="F6890992" href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001" id="IAS20_X0060">IAS 39</xref>. The benefit of the government loan is measured at the inception of the loan as the difference between the cash received and the amount at which the loan is initially recognised in the statement of financial position. This benefit is accounted for in accordance with IAS 20.</p></body></paragraph>
