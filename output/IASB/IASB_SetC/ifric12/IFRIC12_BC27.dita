The contractual service arrangement between the grantor and operator would not convey the right to use the infrastructure to the operator. The IFRIC concluded that this treatment is also consistent with IAS 18 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Revenue</ph></ph><xref keyref="footnotes/IFRIC12_FN0045" type="fn"/> because, for arrangements within the scope of the Interpretation, the second condition of paragraph 14 of IAS 18 is not satisfied. The grantor retains continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership and control over the infrastructure as described in <xref base="F32756990" href="IFRIC12_5.dita#IFRIC12_5" id="IFRIC12_X0281">paragraph 5</xref>.</p>     </variant></body></paragraph>
