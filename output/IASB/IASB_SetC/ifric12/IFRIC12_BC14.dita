The IFRIC noted that addressing the accounting for such arrangements was not the primary purpose of the project because the IFRIC had been asked to provide guidance for public&#x2011;to&#x2011;private arrangements that meet the requirements set out in <xref id="IFRIC12_X0250" base="F1800236" href="IFRIC12_5.dita#IFRIC12_5">paragraph 5</xref> and have the characteristics described in <xref id="IFRIC12_X0251" base="F1800237" href="IFRIC12_3.dita#IFRIC12_3">paragraph 3</xref>. The IFRIC noted that application by analogy would be appropriate under the hierarchy set out in <xref id="IFRIC12_X0252" base="F1800238" href="../ias08/IAS08_g7-12.dita#IAS08_g7-12/IAS08_g7-12_TI">paragraphs 7&#x2013;12 of IAS 8 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors</ph></ph></xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
