It requires items within this definition to be recognised as property, plant and equipment unless another standard requires or permits a different approach. As an example of a different approach, it highlights the requirement in IAS 17 for recognition of leased property, plant and equipment to be evaluated on the basis of the transfer of risks and rewards. That standard defines a lease as &#x2018;an agreement whereby the lessor conveys to the lessee in return for a series of payments the right to use an asset&#x2019; and it sets out the requirements for classification of leases. <ph>IFRIC 4 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease</ph></ph></ph> interprets the meaning of right to use an asset as &#x2018;the arrangement conveys the right to control the use of the underlying asset.&#x2019;</p></body></paragraph>
