The scope of the project was considered at length during the initial stage, as indicated above. The IFRIC confirmed its view that the proposed Interpretation should address the issues set out in <xref id="IFRIC12_X0248" base="F1800234" href="IFRIC12_g10-10.dita#IFRIC12_g10-10/IFRIC12_g10-10_TI">paragraph 10</xref>. Nonetheless, during its redeliberation the IFRIC considered the range of typical arrangements for private sector participation in the provision of public services, including some that were outside the scope of the proposed Interpretation. The IFRIC decided that the Interpretation could provide references to relevant standards that apply to arrangements outside the scope of the Interpretation without giving guidance on their application. If experience showed that such guidance was needed, a separate project could be undertaken at a later date. <xref id="IFRIC12_X0249" base="F1800235" href="IFRIC12_IG_note2.dita#IFRIC12_IG_note2/IFRIC12_IG_note2_TI">Information Note 2</xref> contains a table of references to relevant standards for the types of arrangements considered by the IFRIC.</p></body></paragraph>
