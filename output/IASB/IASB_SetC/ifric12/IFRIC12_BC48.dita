Rather, the operator has an opportunity to charge those who use the public service in the future. The operator bears the demand risk and hence its commercial return is contingent on users using the public service. The operator&#x2019;s asset is a licence, which would be classified as an intangible asset within the scope of <xref base="F1800464" href="../ias38/IAS38_TOC0001.dita" id="IFRIC12_X0319">IAS 38</xref>. And, as clarified in <xref base="F1800465" href="../ias32/IAS32_AG10.dita#IAS32_AG10" id="IFRIC12_X0320">paragraph AG10 of the application guidance in IAS 32</xref>:</p><lq>       <p base="F1411477" id="IFRIC12_P1383">Physical assets (such as inventories, property, plant and equipment), leased assets and intangible assets (such as patents and trademarks) are not financial assets. Control of such physical and intangible assets creates an opportunity to generate an inflow of cash or another financial asset, but it does not give rise to a present right to receive cash or another financial asset.</p>     </lq></body></paragraph>
