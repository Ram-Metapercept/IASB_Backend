It noted that the precise terms and circumstances of the obligations would vary from contract to contract. It concluded that the requirements and guidance in <xref base="F1800501" href="../ias37/IAS37_TOC.dita" id="IFRIC12_X0329">IAS 37</xref> were sufficiently clear to enable an operator to identify the period(s) in which different obligations should be recognised.</p></body></paragraph>
