However, for arrangements within the scope of the Interpretation, the operator&#x2019;s right is different from that of a lessee: the grantor retains control over the use to which the infrastructure is put, by controlling or regulating what services the operator must provide, to whom it must provide them, and at what price, as described in <xref id="IFRIC12_X0282" base="F1800356" href="IFRIC12_5.dita#IFRIC12_5">paragraph 5(a)</xref>. The grantor also retains control over any significant residual interest in the infrastructure throughout the period of the arrangement. Unlike a lessee, the operator does not have a right of use of the underlying asset: rather it has access to operate the infrastructure to provide the public service on behalf of the grantor in accordance with the terms specified in the contract.</p></body></paragraph>
