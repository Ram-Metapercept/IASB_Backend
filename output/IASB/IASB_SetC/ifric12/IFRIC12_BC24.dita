The IFRIC decided that, if an arrangement met the conditions in <xref id="IFRIC12_X0268" base="F1800323" href="IFRIC12_5.dita#IFRIC12_5">paragraph 5</xref>, the operator would not have the right to control the use of the underlying asset and should therefore not recognise the infrastructure as a leased asset.</p></body></paragraph>
