It also decided to specify the accounting treatment only for infrastructure that the operator constructed or acquired from a third party, or to which it was given access by the grantor, for the purpose of the arrangement. The IFRIC concluded that these conditions were likely to be met in most of the public&#x2011;to&#x2011;private arrangements for which guidance had been sought.</p></body></paragraph>
