The IFRIC noted public&#x2011;to&#x2011;private service agreements are rarely if ever the same; technical requirements vary by sector and country. Furthermore, the terms of the contractual agreement may also depend on the specific features of the overall legal framework of the particular country. Public&#x2011;to&#x2011;private service contract laws, where they exist, may contain terms that do not have to be repeated in individual contracts.</p></body></paragraph>
