The IFRIC included the requirement to account separately for each component (sometimes known as a bifurcated arrangement) of the operator&#x2019;s consideration in response to a concern raised on the draft Interpretations. The concern was that, in some arrangements, both parties to the contract share the risk (demand risk) that the cash flows generated by users of the public service will not be sufficient to recover the operator&#x2019;s investment. In order to achieve the desired sharing of risk, the parties often agree to arrangements under which the grantor pays the operator for its services partly by a financial asset and partly by granting a right to charge users of the public service (an intangible asset). The IFRIC concluded that in these circumstances it would be necessary to divide the operator&#x2019;s consideration into a financial asset component for any guaranteed amount of cash or other financial asset and an intangible asset for the remainder.</p></body></paragraph>
