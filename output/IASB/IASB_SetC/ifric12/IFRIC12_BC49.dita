It concluded that although the operator&#x2019;s asset might have characteristics that are similar to those of a financial asset, it would not meet the definition of a financial asset in <xref base="F1800466" href="../ias32/IAS32_TOC.dita" id="IFRIC12_X0321">IAS 32</xref>: the operator would not at the balance sheet date have a contractual right to receive cash from another entity. That other entity (ie the user) would still have the ability to avoid any obligation. The grantor would be passing to the operator an opportunity to charge users in future, not a present right to receive cash.</p></body></paragraph>
