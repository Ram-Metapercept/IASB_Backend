The accounting issue to be addressed for existing assets of the operator is one of derecognition, which is already addressed in IFRSs (<xref base="F7165222" href="../ias16/IAS16_TOC.dita#IAS16_TOC0001" id="IFRIC12_X0254">IAS 16 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Property, Plant and Equipment</ph></ph></xref>). In the light of the comments received from respondents, the IFRIC decided to clarify that certain public&#x2011;to&#x2011;private service arrangements may convey to the grantor a right to use existing assets of the operator, in which case the operator would apply the derecognition requirements of IFRSs to determine whether it should derecognise its existing assets.</p></body></paragraph>
