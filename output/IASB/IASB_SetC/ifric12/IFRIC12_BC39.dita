To obtain additional information, IASB staff arranged for discussions with preparers, auditors and regulators. The consensus of those consulted was that the identity of the payer has no effect on the risks to the operator&#x2019;s cash flow stream. The operator typically relies on the terms of the service arrangement contract to determine the risks to its cash flow stream. The operator&#x2019;s cash flows may be guaranteed by the grantor, in which case the grantor bears demand risk, or the operator&#x2019;s cash flows may be conditional on usage levels, in which case the operator bears demand risk.</p></body></paragraph>
