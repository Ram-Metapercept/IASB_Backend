The Board decided to clarify that items such as spare parts, stand-by equipment and servicing equipment shall be recognised as property, plant and equipment when they meet the definition of property, plant and equipment. If they do not meet this definition they are classified as inventory. In the light of respondents&#x2019; comments to the June 2011 exposure draft, the Board did not make explicit reference to the classification of particular types of equipment, because the definition of property, plant and equipment already provides sufficient guidance. The Board also deleted from <xref id="IAS16_X0387" base="F18657100" href="IAS16_8.dita#IAS16_8">paragraph 8</xref> the requirement to account for spare parts and servicing equipment as property, plant and equipment only if they were used in connection with an item of property, plant and equipment because this requirement was too restrictive when compared with the definition of property, plant and equipment. </p></body></paragraph>
