By analogy, biological transformation should not be included either. The Board further noted that most of the investors and analysts consulted during the outreach performed by the staff said that the <xref base="F35269960" href="../ias41/IAS41_TOC.dita#IAS41_TOC0001/IAS41_TOC0001_V2" id="IAS16_X0496">IAS 41</xref> fair value information about bearer plants is of limited use to them and that the measurement of the fair values of bearer plants is particularly subjective during the early years of the life cycle of those bearer plants.
