The Board observed that including livestock would make the use of a cost model more complex. Unlike plants, livestock is not attached to land and there is usually an active market for it, meaning that fair value information is likely to be readily available and easier to apply than cost measurement. As noted in <xref base="F35269884" href="IAS16_BC51.dita#IAS16_BC51" id="IAS16_X0477">paragraph BC51</xref>, concerns raised by respondents to the 2011 Agenda Consultation mainly relate to plants, not livestock. Consequently, the Board decided to restrict the scope to plants.</p></body></paragraph>
