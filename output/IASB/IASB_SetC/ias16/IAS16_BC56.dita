A few respondents disagreed with the Board&#x2019;s observation in <xref id="IAS16_X0482" base="F35269919" href="IAS16_BC52.dita#IAS16_BC52">paragraph BC52</xref> that a cost model would be complex to implement for bearer livestock and noted that cost-based models are used for livestock in some jurisdictions. However, they did not provide any further information on how a cost model like the one in IAS 16 can be applied to livestock.</p></body></paragraph>
