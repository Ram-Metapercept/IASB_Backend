Some argue that the objective is one of precision, ie reducing the amount of depreciation so that it reflects the item&#x2019;s net cost. Others argue that the objective is one of economics, ie stopping depreciation if, because of inflation or otherwise, an entity expects that during its useful life an asset will increase in value by an amount greater than it will diminish.</p></body></paragraph>
