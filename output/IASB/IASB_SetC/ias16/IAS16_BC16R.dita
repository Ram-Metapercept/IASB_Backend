The Board concluded that when testing whether an asset is functioning       properly, an entity assesses the technical and physical performance of the asset. The       assessment of functioning properly is not an assessment of the financial performance of an       asset, such as assessing whether the asset has achieved the level of operating margin       initially anticipated by management.</p></body></paragraph>
