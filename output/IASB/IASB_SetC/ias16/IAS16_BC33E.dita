A method that is based on revenue generated from an activity that includes the use of an asset would be, in contrast, a method based on the generation of future economic benefits from the use of the asset. As a result of the feedback received on the ED, the IASB also decided not to retain the comments that it had included in the Basis for Conclusions on the ED on the limited circumstances in which a revenue-based method gives the same result as a units of production method. Many respondents to the ED found these comments contradictory to the guidance proposed in the Standard.</p>  </variant></body></paragraph>
