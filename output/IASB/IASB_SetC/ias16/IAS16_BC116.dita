The amendments respond to this concern and are expected to significantly reduce costs for preparers of financial statements by permitting a cost model for bearer plants. However, entities will still be required to perform the following fair value measurements:</p><ol id="IAS16_L0048" base="F32830908" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IAS16_P0586" base="F32830910">the produce growing on the bearer plants will still be measured at fair value less costs to sell. The Board&#x2019;s reasoning for requiring the produce to be measured at fair value less costs to sell is set out in <xref id="IAS16_X0530" base="F35270096" href="IAS16_gBC73-BC79.dita#IAS16_gBC73-BC79">paragraphs BC73&#x2013;BC79</xref>.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IAS16_P0587" base="F32830912">as is the case for all items of property, plant and equipment, bearer plants will be subject to an impairment test under <xref id="IAS16_X0531" base="F35270097" href="../ias36/IAS36_TOC0001.dita#IAS36_TOC0001/IAS36_TOC0001_V2">IAS 36</xref>. Consequently, if there is an indication that bearer plants are impaired at the reporting date, the entity would be required to estimate the recoverable amount of the asset (or its cash-generating unit). The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
