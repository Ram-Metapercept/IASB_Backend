The IASB noted that even though revenue could sometimes be considered to be a measurement of the output generated by the asset, revenue does not, as a matter of principle, reflect the way in which an item of property, plant and equipment is used or consumed. The IASB observed that the price component of revenue may be affected by inflation and noted that inflation has no bearing upon the way in which an asset is consumed.</p>  </variant></body></paragraph>
