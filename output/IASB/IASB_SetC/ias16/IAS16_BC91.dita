The Board also observed that if additional productivity disclosures were included in IAS 16 for bearer plants (other than those in <xref id="IAS16_X0513" base="F35270003" href="../ias41/IAS41_46.dita#IAS41_46">paragraph 46 of IAS 41</xref>), it would be difficult to justify requiring them in IAS 16 for bearer plants and not in IAS 41 for other biological assets. The Board noted that reconsidering the disclosure requirements of IAS 41 was outside the scope of this project. Consequently, the Board decided not to add any additional disclosures in IAS 16 for bearer plants.</p></body></paragraph>
