Some respondents suggested only requiring fair value less costs to sell to be measured at the point of harvest, or providing additional relief from fair value measurement on the basis of cost-benefit considerations. Other respondents suggested accounting for produce using a cost model before harvest, similarly to inventories or work in progress. Several respondents said further guidance should be provided on how to measure the produce at fair value.</p></body></paragraph>
