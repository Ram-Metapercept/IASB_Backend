The Board concluded that users of financial statements would consider these gains and the proceeds from an entity&#x2019;s sale of goods in the course of its ordinary activities differently in their evaluation of an entity&#x2019;s past results and their projections of future cash flows. This is because revenue from the sale of goods is typically more likely to recur in comparable amounts than are gains from sales of items of property, plant and equipment. Accordingly, the Board concluded that an entity should not classify as revenue gains on disposals of items of property, plant and equipment.</p></body></paragraph>
