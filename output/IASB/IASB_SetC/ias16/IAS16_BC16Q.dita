Such an       amendment would not be narrow in scope&#x2014;it might affect the measurement of many items of       property, plant and equipment, and additional research would be required to assess potential       unintended consequences. Furthermore, the Board had obtained no evidence that differences in       how entities determine when an asset is available for use could lead to material differences       in the entities&#x2019; financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
