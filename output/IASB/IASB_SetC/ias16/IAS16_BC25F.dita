The Board noted that the accumulated depreciation would not be able to be restated proportionately to the gross carrying amount in situations in which both the gross carrying amount and the carrying amount are revalued non&#x2011;proportionately to each other. It was noted that this was the case regardless of whether there had been a re-estimation of residual value, the useful life or the depreciation method in a prior period.</p></body></paragraph>
