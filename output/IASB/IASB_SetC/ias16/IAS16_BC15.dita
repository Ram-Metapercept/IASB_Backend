Therefore, the Board decided that the cost of an item should include the costs of dismantlement, removal or restoration, the obligation for which an entity has incurred as a consequence of having used the item during a particular period other than to produce inventories during that period. An entity applies <xref id="IAS16_X0391" base="F15830944" href="../ias02/IAS02_TOC0001.dita#IAS02_TOC0001">IAS 2 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Inventories</ph></ph></xref> to the costs of these obligations that are incurred as a consequence of having used the item during a particular period to produce inventories during that period. The Board observed that accounting for these costs initially in accordance with <xref id="IAS16_X0392" base="F15830945" href="../ias02/IAS02_TOC0001.dita#IAS02_TOC0001">IAS 2</xref> acknowledges their nature. Furthermore, doing so achieves the same result as including these costs as an element of the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment, depreciating them over the production period just completed and identifying the depreciation charge as a cost to produce another asset (inventory), in which case the depreciation charge constitutes part of the cost of that other asset.</p></body></paragraph>
