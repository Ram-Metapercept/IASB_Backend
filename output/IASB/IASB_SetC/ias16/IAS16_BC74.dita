Consequently, fair value measurement of the growing produce provides useful information to users of financial statements about future cash flows that an entity will actually realise. In contrast the bearer plants themselves are not sold and the changes in the fair value of the bearer plants do not directly influence the entity&#x2019;s future cash flows. The Board also observed that produce will ultimately be detached from the bearer plants and is normally sold separately, meaning it has a market value on its own. This is in contrast to many bearer plants that are unlikely to have an observable market value on their own because they can only be sold while attached to the land.</p></body></paragraph>
