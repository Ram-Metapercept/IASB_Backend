However, the Board noted that the proposed amendment would improve financial statement presentation before those projects could be completed and decided to add <xref base="F15999323" href="IAS16_68A.dita#IAS16_68A" id="IAS16_X0442">paragraph 68A</xref> as previously exposed. A few respondents raised the concern that the term &#x2018;held for sale&#x2019; in the amendment could be confused with the notion of held for sale in accordance with <xref base="F15999422" href="../ifrs05/IFRS05_TOC.dita#IFRS05_TOC0001" id="IAS16_X0443">IFRS 5 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Non&#x2011;current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations</ph></ph></xref>. Consequently, the Board clarified in the amendment that <xref base="F15999421" href="../ifrs05/IFRS05_TOC.dita#IFRS05_TOC0001" id="IAS16_X0444">IFRS 5</xref> should not be applied in those circumstances.</p></body></paragraph>
