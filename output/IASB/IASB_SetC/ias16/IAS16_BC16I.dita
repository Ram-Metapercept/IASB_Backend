The Board made this decision       because:</p><ol type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value><p>IAS 2 sets out a framework for measuring cost without being           overly prescriptive; and </p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value><p>an entity would already be required to apply IAS 2 in measuring           cost if the entity were to determine that the sale of items produced is an output of its           ordinary activities&#x2014;in this case, the items produced would meet IAS 2&#x2019;s definition of           inventories. It would be useful to apply the same requirements to the cost of items           produced irrespective of whether the sale of those items is an output of an entity&#x2019;s           ordinary activities.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
