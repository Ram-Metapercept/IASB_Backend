Of particular concern to the Board were situations in which the unit of measure is the &#x2018;item as a whole&#x2019; even though that item may be composed of significant parts with individually varying useful lives or consumption patterns. The Board did not believe that, in these situations, an entity&#x2019;s use of approximation techniques, such as a weighted average useful life for the item as a whole, resulted in depreciation that faithfully represents an entity&#x2019;s varying expectations for the significant parts.</p></body></paragraph>
