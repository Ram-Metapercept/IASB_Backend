In doing so, the Board did not adopt completely either the &#x2018;net cost&#x2019; or the &#x2018;economics&#x2019; objective. Given the concept of depreciation as a cost allocation technique, the Board concluded that an entity&#x2019;s expectation of increases in an asset&#x2019;s value, because of inflation or otherwise, does not override the need to depreciate it. Thus, the Board changed the definition of residual value to the amount an entity could receive for the asset currently (at the financial reporting date) if the asset were already as old and worn as it will be when the entity expects to dispose of it. Thus, an increase in the expected residual value of an asset because of past events will affect the depreciable amount; expectations of future changes in residual value other than the effects of expected wear and tear will not.</p></body></paragraph>
