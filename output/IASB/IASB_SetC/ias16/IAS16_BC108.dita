The Board does not expect the choice of accounting policy in IAS 16 to reduce comparability between entities with bearer plants because most entities are expected to choose the cost model for the reasons explained in <xref base="F35270044" href="IAS16_BC103.dita#IAS16_BC103" id="IAS16_X0524">paragraph BC103</xref>.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p base="F32830891" id="IAS16_P0576">The primary benefits of using fair value for biological assets are that fair value captures biological development (ie the growth of the produce) and is closely aligned with how the entity expects to convert the asset to cash (ie through sale). The Board has retained fair value for the produce of a bearer plant (for which these primary benefits are applicable) while aligning the accounting for the bearer plant with the accounting for property, plant and equipment. The Board considers that this change will improve comparability by distinguishing between types of biological asset.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p base="F32830892" id="IAS16_P0577">The Board observed that some entities may elect to measure bearer plants at fair value on initial application of the amendments and use that fair value as its deemed cost at that date, while others may elect to apply the amendments retrospectively (eg if they currently use a cost model in accordance with IAS 16 for management purposes). However, the Board noted that if there is any lack of comparability between entities on initial application, it is just as likely to arise from the aggregation of costs incurred at different dates as from the use of fair value as deemed cost by some but not all entities. Furthermore, the use of fair value as the deemed cost for bearer plants means that an entity will report the same cost data as if it had acquired bearer plants with the same remaining service potential at the date of transition to IFRS, eg if it had purchased an area of plantation on that date.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
