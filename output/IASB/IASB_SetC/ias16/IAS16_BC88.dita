It also noted that there is also no clear basis for requiring entities with bearer plants to provide fair value disclosures for their land when these disclosures are not required for land used for other purposes. The Board further acknowledged that the limited-scope project was not intended to address fair value disclosure requirements for other assets in IAS 16. Consequently, the Board decided not to require additional fair value disclosures for entities with bearer plants.</p></body></paragraph>
