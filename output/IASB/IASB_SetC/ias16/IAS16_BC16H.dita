A number of respondents to the Board&#x2019;s draft amendments suggested that the       Board develop such requirements. They said measuring the cost of items produced could require       extensive judgement, which in turn could result in differences in how entities measure that       cost. Respondents&#x2019; views differed on how prescriptive any requirements should be&#x2014;some       suggested the Board develop only high-level principles while others suggested providing       detailed application guidance.</p></body></paragraph>
