The Board observed that requiring this disclosure requirement for the current year would be burdensome because it would require an entity to maintain dual systems in the year of initial application. The Board noted that not requiring this disclosure for the current year would be consistent with its other decisions during the project. Consequently for both the amendments to IAS 16 and the amendments to IAS 41, the Board decided to exempt entities from providing the disclosure required by paragraph 28(f) for the current period. Entities would still be required to provide those disclosures for each prior period presented in the financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
