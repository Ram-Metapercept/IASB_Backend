Recognising proceeds before intended use and related cost in profit or loss will       result in entities reporting amounts that more faithfully represent their performance and       financial position. It will also have confirmatory value about an entity&#x2019;s performance. The       disclosure requirements in paragraph 74A(b) will highlight such proceeds and cost for users       of financial statements (see paragraphs BC16L&#x2013;BC16M).</p></body></paragraph>
