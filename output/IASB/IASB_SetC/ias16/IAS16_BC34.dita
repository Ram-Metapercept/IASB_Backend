The requirements in that principle ensure the representational faithfulness of an entity&#x2019;s recognised revenue. Representational faithfulness is also the appropriate objective for an entity&#x2019;s recognised gains. However, in IAS 16, the revenue recognition principle&#x2019;s criteria drive derecognition of the asset disposed of rather than recognition of the proceeds received. Applying the principle instead to the recognition of the proceeds might lead to the conclusion that an entity will recognise a deferred gain. Deferred gains do not meet the definition of a liability under the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph>. Thus, the Board decided that an entity does not derecognise an item of property, plant and equipment until the requirements in IAS 18 to recognise revenue on the sale of goods are met.</p>     </variant></body></paragraph>
