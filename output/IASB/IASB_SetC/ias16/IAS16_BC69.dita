Once bearer plants mature, they are held by an entity solely to grow produce and so, apart from bearing produce, their biological transformation is no longer significant in generating future economic benefits. Consequently, the Board decided bearer plants should be accounted for under IAS 16 instead of IAS 41 (see <xref base="F35269927" href="IAS16_gBC63-BC68_V1.dita#IAS16_gBC63-BC68_V1" id="IAS16_X0493">paragraphs BC63&#x2013;BC68</xref>). However, the Board noted that the same argument is not true for bearer plants before they reach maturity and bear produce. Until they reach maturity, bearer plants are in a growth phase and so undergo significant biological transformation. Furthermore, the Board noted that the produce growing on the bearer plants is undergoing biological transformation until it is harvested (for example, grapes growing on a grape vine). <xref base="F35269928" href="IAS16_BC70.dita#IAS16_BC70" id="IAS16_X0494">Paragraphs BC70&#x2013;BC79</xref> explain the reasons supporting the Board&#x2019;s conclusions regarding bearer plants before they reach maturity and the produce growing on the bearer plants.</p></body></paragraph>
