Furthermore, if a biological asset is commonly sold as agricultural produce, there will often be an active market for sale of that biological asset separately from land, meaning that fair value information is likely to be readily available and easier to apply than cost measurement. The Board also noted that the concerns raised by respondents to the 2011 Agenda Consultation generally relate to plants that do not have an alternative use to the entity and that do not have a market value separate from the land component. Consequently, any sales transactions that take place in the market are likely to be of bearer plants plus land, and possibly whole plantations. For these reasons, the Board decided to limit the scope to biological assets that are solely used as bearer biological assets.</p></body></paragraph>
