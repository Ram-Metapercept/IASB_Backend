The Board was informed of differences in how entities make       that determination, and considered suggestions to clarify when an asset is available for use.       Some of those making this suggestion said the existence of significant proceeds before       intended use might indicate that an asset is already available for use before it is determined       to be so. In their view, such a clarification would reduce the amount of proceeds being       deducted from the cost of an asset than had previously been the case and, thus, would address       the matter identified in paragraph BC16B without changing how those proceeds are       recognised.</p></body></paragraph>
