<paragraph id="IAS16_DO10" base="F32965210"><paranum>DO10</paranum><prolog><data name="standard_number" value="IAS 16"/><data name="paranum" value="DO10"/></prolog><body><p id="IAS16_P0603">Mr Finnegan and Ms McConnell believe that if bearer assets are measured at accumulated cost, then at a minimum, the fair value of the bearer plants should be a required disclosure, including information about the valuation techniques and key inputs/assumptions used. However, the 2014 Amendment is not requiring disclosure of fair value. Consequently, critical information is being eliminated from the financial statements of entities engaged in agricultural activities using bearer assets. Mr Finnegan and Ms McConnell do not believe that this is an improvement to financial reporting. In January 2013, the Trustees of the IFRS Foundation approved a new <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Due Process Handbook</ph></ph> that specifies, among other things, the criteria for new Standards or major improvements. The main criteria (in addition to pervasiveness of the issue) are (a) whether there is a deficiency in the way particular types of transactions or activities are reported in financial reports, and (b) the importance of the matter to those who use financial reports. Mr Finnegan and Ms McConnell believe that, from a user perspective, there is no deficiency in the accounting for, and disclosures about, bearer assets in IAS 41 and that fair value information is important (indeed essential) to those who use the financial reports of entities engaged in agricultural activity.</p></body></paragraph>
