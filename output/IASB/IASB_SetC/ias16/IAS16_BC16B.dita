Some entities deducted only proceeds from selling items produced       while testing; others deducted the proceeds of all sales until an asset was in the location       and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management       (ie available for use). For some entities, the proceeds deducted from the cost of an item of       property, plant and equipment could be significant and could exceed the costs of testing.</p></body></paragraph>
