They said that including bearer plants in IAS 16 would mean that this disclosure requirement would no longer apply to them. The Board observed that this is likely to have a limited effect in practice because the disclosures in paragraph 46 of IAS 41 will continue to apply to the produce in IAS 41 as follows:</p><ol id="IAS16_L0043" base="SL32831063" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IAS16_P0531" base="SL32831065">paragraph 46(a) and (b)(ii) of IAS 41&#x2014;the Board noted that the disclosures made by entities in accordance with paragraphs 46(a) and (b)(ii) would be the same regardless of whether those paragraphs refer to the entire plant or only the produce.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IAS16_P0532" base="SL32831067">paragraph 46(b)(i) of IAS 41&#x2014;the Board noted that paragraph 46(b)(i) now applies to physical quantities of produce instead of physical quantities of entire plants. The Board noted that paragraph 46(b)(i) does not stipulate the type of non-financial measures or estimates that an entity needs to provide. The Board also noted that plantation companies generally provide more information about productivity of bearer plants outside the financial statements than is required by paragraph 46 of IAS 41 and would be likely to continue to disclose their chosen non-financial measures of bearer plants even if this paragraph only refers to produce.</p></li></ol><p id="IAS16_P0533" base="SL32831068">Consequently, the Board decided not to add the disclosures in paragraph 46 of IAS 41 to IAS 16.</p></body></paragraph>
