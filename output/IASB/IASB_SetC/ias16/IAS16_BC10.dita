With two principles, consistency is not achieved unless it is clear when each should apply. Because IAS 16 does not address what constitutes an &#x2018;item&#x2019; of property, plant and equipment, this clarity was not assured because some might characterise a particular cost as the initial cost of a new item of property, plant and equipment and others might regard it as a subsequent cost of an existing item of property, plant and equipment.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
