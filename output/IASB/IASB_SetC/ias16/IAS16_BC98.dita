Virtually all respondents to the ED supported this requirement for first-time adopters of IFRSs. The Board thus confirmed the proposals for first-time adopters. The Board noted that no consequential amendments to IFRS 1 were required because bearer plants are accounted for as items of property, plant and equipment. Consequently, exemptions already provided in IFRS 1 would address first-time application issues related to bearer plants.</p></body></paragraph>
