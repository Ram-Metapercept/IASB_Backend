This is because it would not be possible for management to avoid using hindsight in making the necessary estimates as of earlier dates. Accordingly, the Board decided that in accordance with the provisions of <xref base="F15999424" href="../ias08/IAS08_TOC.dita#IAS08_TOC0001" id="IAS16_X0446">IAS 8</xref> an entity should consider commercial substance only in evaluating the initial measurement of future transactions involving an exchange of non&#x2011;monetary assets.</p></body></paragraph>
