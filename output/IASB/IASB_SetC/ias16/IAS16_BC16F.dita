Those holding this view suggested that such sales proceeds&#x2014;and the related margin&#x2014;may have little predictive value because:</p><ol type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>         <p>the sales proceeds are generally non-recurring and are not necessarily an output of an entity&#x2019;s ordinary activities; and</p>       </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>         <p>the cost of items produced would not include depreciation of the item of property, plant and equipment&#x2014;because depreciation of that asset begins when it is available for use.</p>       </li></ol></body></paragraph>
