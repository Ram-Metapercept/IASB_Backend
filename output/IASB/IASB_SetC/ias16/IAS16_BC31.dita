The Board also discussed but decided not to address the measurement of assets held for sale. The Board concluded that whether to apply a different measurement model to assets held for sale&#x2014;which may or may not be idle&#x2014;was a different question and was beyond the scope of the Improvements project.</p></body></paragraph>
