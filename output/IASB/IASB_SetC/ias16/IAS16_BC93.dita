However, some respondents asked for guidance on applying the revaluation model to bearer plants. The Board decided that the requirements of the revaluation model are clear without additional guidance and it noted its expectation that the vast majority of entities with bearer plants will use the cost model for the reasons set out in <xref id="IAS16_X0514" base="F35270004" href="IAS16_BC103.dita#IAS16_BC103">paragraph BC103</xref>.
