Taking into consideration its project for the convergence of IFRSs and US GAAP, the Board discussed whether to change the manner in which its &#x2018;reliable measurement&#x2019; test is described. The Board observed this was unnecessary because it believes that its guidance and that contained in US GAAP are intended to have the same meaning.</p></body></paragraph>
