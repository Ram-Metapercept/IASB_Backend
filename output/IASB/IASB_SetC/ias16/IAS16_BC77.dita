Paragraph 10(c) of IAS 41 states that an entity shall recognise a biological asset only when the fair value or cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Paragraph 30 of IAS 41 requires a biological asset to be measured using a cost model if fair value measurement is determined to be clearly unreliable. The Board noted that this limited-scope project was not intended to address the fair value model in IAS 41. Consequently, the Board agreed not to further discuss the exemptions in IAS 41 as part of this project.</p></body></paragraph>
