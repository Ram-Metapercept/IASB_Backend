Consequently, fair value changes in the produce have a direct relationship to the expectations of future cash flows that the entity will receive on sale. In contrast, bearer plants are normally held by an entity for the whole of their useful life and then scrapped, so changes in fair value are not directly recognised as cash flows on sale of the bearer plants. Consequently, the Board thinks that providing separate fair value information for the produce is likely to improve the ability of users of the financial statements to assess future cash flows.</p></body></paragraph>
