In the Exposure Draft (ED), the Board proposed to include within IAS 16&#x2019;s general recognition principle only the recognition of subsequent expenditures that are replacements of a part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Also in the ED, the Board proposed to modify the subsequent expenditure recognition principle to distinguish more clearly the expenditures to which it would continue to apply.</p></body></paragraph>
