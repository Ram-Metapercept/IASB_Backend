This is because many entities have developed practices to separate contracts with customers in a manner that was similar to the requirements in IFRS 15. However, the boards observed that because there were specific requirements in previous US GAAP, there would be a change in the accounting for incidental obligations and marketing incentives (see <xref id="IFRS15_X2287" base="F35620135" href="IFRS15_gBC87-BC93.dita#IFRS15_gBC87-BC93">paragraphs BC87&#x2013;BC93</xref>). This is because the requirements in IFRS 15 would require an entity to identify and recognise revenue for those goods or services, when previously they may have been recognised as an expense or ignored for the purposes of revenue recognition. The boards observed that two industries that would be particularly affected by this change are the automotive industry (which previously recognised as an expense the promise of maintenance with the purchase of an automobile) and the telecommunications industry (which sometimes did not attribute any revenue to the handsets provided as part of a bundled offering).</p></body></paragraph>
