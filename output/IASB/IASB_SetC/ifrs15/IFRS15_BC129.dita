In those cases, because the customer controls any work in progress, the customer is obtaining the benefits of the goods or services that the entity is providing and, thus, the performance obligation is satisfied over time. For example, in the case of a construction contract in which the entity is building on the customer&#x2019;s land, the customer generally controls any work in progress arising from the entity&#x2019;s performance.</p></body></paragraph>
