The boards decided to include this notion as part of the definition of a performance obligation to simplify the application of the model and to promote consistency in the identification of performance obligations in circumstances in which the entity provides the same good or service consecutively over a period of time (for example, a repetitive service arrangement). To be accounted for as a single performance obligation, each of those promised goods or services must be performance obligations satisfied over time in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X1864" base="F35363507" href="IFRS15_35.dita#IFRS15_35">paragraph 35 of IFRS 15</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
