However, the boards decided that any new term that was used might result in diversity in practice, because entities might interpret the new term in different ways. Consequently, the boards decided that the most appropriate level of confidence would be &#x2018;highly probable&#x2019; for IFRS and &#x2018;probable&#x2019; for US GAAP as a result of the usage of those terms in existing requirements.</p></body></paragraph>
