The boards decided that that type of payment would meet that criterion if the entity&#x2019;s right to retain (and not refund) that payment would be enforceable if the customer terminated the contract. Furthermore, the boards noted that the right to payment should be enforceable; otherwise, it is questionable whether the entity actually has a right to payment. Consequently, the boards included the factors in <xref id="IFRS15_X1909" base="F35619153" href="IFRS15_B12.dita#IFRS15_B12">paragraph B12 of IFRS 15</xref> to help an entity determine whether the right to payment would be enforceable.</p></body></paragraph>
