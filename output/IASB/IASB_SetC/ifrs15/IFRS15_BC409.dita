The activities may be part of an entity&#x2019;s ongoing and ordinary activities and customary business practices. However, the boards noted that it was not enough that the entity undertook activities, but also that those activities affected the intellectual property to which the customer has rights and, thus, exposes the customer to positive or negative effects. In those cases, the customer will essentially be using the most recent form of the intellectual property throughout the licence period. The boards observed that when the activities do not affect the customer, the entity is merely changing its own asset, which, although it may affect the entity&#x2019;s ability to provide future licences, would not affect the determination of what the licence provides or what the customer controls.</p></body></paragraph>
