Furthermore, the IASB noted that IFRS 15 should resolve some pressing issues in practice arising from previous revenue recognition requirements. For example, the requirements for determining whether a performance obligation is satisfied over time should address the current diversity in practice associated with the application of the interpretation of IFRS on the construction of real estate.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
