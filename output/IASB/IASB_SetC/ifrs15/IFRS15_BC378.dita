Those laws typically require an entity to pay compensation if one of its products causes harm or damage. The boards noted that an entity should not recognise a performance obligation arising from those laws because the performance obligation in a contract is to transfer the product to the customer. To the extent that an entity expects the product(s) to be defective, the entity should recognise a liability for the expected costs to repair or replace the product (see <xref base="F35619849" href="IFRS15_B33.dita#IFRS15_B33" id="IFRS15_X2097">paragraph B33 of IFRS 15</xref>). Any obligation of the entity to pay compensation for the damage or harm that its product causes is separate from the performance obligation. The boards noted that an entity should account for this obligation separately from the contract with the customer and in accordance with the requirements for loss contingencies in <xref base="F35619880" href="../ias37/IAS37_TOC.dita#IAS37_TOC0001" id="IFRS15_X2098">IAS 37</xref> or Topic 450.</p></body></paragraph>
