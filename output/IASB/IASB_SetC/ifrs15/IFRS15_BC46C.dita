That assessment considers the entity&#x2019;s exposure to the customer&#x2019;s credit risk and the business practices available to the entity to manage its exposure to credit risk throughout the contract. For example, an entity may be able to stop providing goods or services to the customer or require advance payments. This is consistent with the explanation of the boards&#x2019; considerations as described in <xref id="IFRS15_X1771" base="F51967194" href="IFRS15_BC46.dita#IFRS15_BC46">paragraph BC46</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
