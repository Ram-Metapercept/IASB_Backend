However, the IASB&#x2019;s actions in issuing any such clarifying amendments should not be perceived as penalising those entities that begin their implementation process early and rewarding those that delay. Such perceptions could discourage entities from starting the implementation of any new Standard on a timely basis.</p></body></paragraph>
