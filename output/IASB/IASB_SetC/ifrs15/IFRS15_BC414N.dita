The FASB&#x2019;s approach has the potential to result in some licences of symbolic intellectual property being classified as a right to access intellectual property, even though there is no expectation that the entity will undertake activities after making the intellectual property available to the customer. For example, the entity may own a brand that it does not support or maintain, but still grants licences to customers to use the brand in television or movie productions that are set in a time period during which the brand was active. Nonetheless, the FASB decided to adopt this alternative approach on the basis of feedback that the approach would be more operable than the approach contained in Topic 606 when it was issued in May 2014, particularly for entities with a significant number of licensing arrangements and those with diversified operations.</p></body></paragraph>
