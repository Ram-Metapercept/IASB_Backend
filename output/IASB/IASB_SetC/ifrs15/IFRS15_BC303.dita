The FASB observed that it had not intended the application of the cost requirements to result in an outcome for these specific types of sales commissions that would be different from applying existing US GAAP. Consequently, the FASB decided to retain the specific cost requirements for investment companies in paragraph 946&#x2011;605&#x2011;25&#x2011;8 of the Codification which has been moved to Subtopic 946&#x2011;720 <i>Financial Services&#x2014;Investment Companies&#x2014;Other Expenses</i>.</p></body></paragraph>
