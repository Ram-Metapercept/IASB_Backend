This is because revenue can arise from the transfer of different goods or services and from contracts that involve different types of customers or markets. Users of financial statements explained that understanding those differences was critical to their analyses. Consequently, the boards decided to require an entity to provide disaggregated revenue information to help users of financial statements understand the composition of the revenue from contracts with customers recognised in the current period.</p></body></paragraph>
