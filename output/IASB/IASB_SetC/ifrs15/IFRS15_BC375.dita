The entity would have been required to determine the likelihood of the existence of defective products that it had sold to customers and their quantity and, as a consequence, not recognise revenue to the extent that those performance obligations were not satisfied. An advantage of that proposal would have been that an entity would not have recognised the entire transaction price as revenue when the product transferred to the customer, because a portion of the transaction price would not have been recognised as revenue until the entity had repaired or replaced the products that were expected to be defective. However, the boards decided not to retain that proposal, mainly for the following practical reasons:</p><ol id="IFRS15_L0210" base="F31840211" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2681" base="F31840212">there would have been complexities associated with the requirements for an entity to continue to recognise as &#x2018;inventory&#x2019; products that had been delivered to customers and that were expected to be defective; and</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2682" base="F31840214">any margin attributable to the repair or replacement of a product in an assurance-type warranty would have been unlikely to significantly distort the pattern of recognition of the overall contract margin.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
