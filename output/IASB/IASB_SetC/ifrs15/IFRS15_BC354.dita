However, users of financial statements suggested that in many cases, an entity provides a &#x2018;boilerplate&#x2019; description of the accounting policy adopted without explaining how the accounting policy relates to the contracts that the entity enters into with customers. To address this criticism, <xref id="IFRS15_X2077" base="F35619769" href="IFRS15_g119-119.dita#IFRS15_g119-119">paragraph 119 of IFRS 15</xref> requires that an entity disclose information about its performance obligations in contracts with customers. This disclosure complements the accounting policy disclosure requirements in existing Standards by requiring an entity to provide more descriptive information about its performance obligations.</p></body></paragraph>
