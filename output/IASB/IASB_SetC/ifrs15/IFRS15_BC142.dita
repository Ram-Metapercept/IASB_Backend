This is because if an asset that an entity is creating has no alternative use to the entity, the entity is effectively constructing an asset at the direction of the customer. Consequently, the entity will want to be economically protected from the risk of the customer terminating the contract and leaving the entity with no asset or an asset that has little value to the entity. That protection will be established by requiring that if the contract is terminated, the customer must pay for the entity&#x2019;s performance completed to date. This is consistent with other exchange contracts in which a customer would typically be obliged to pay only if it has received control of goods or services in the exchange. Consequently, the fact that the customer is obliged to pay for the entity&#x2019;s performance (or, in other words, is unable to avoid paying for that performance) suggests that the customer has obtained the benefits from the entity&#x2019;s performance.</p></body></paragraph>
