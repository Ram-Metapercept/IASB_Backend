However, some respondents, particularly those in the software industry, asked the boards to clarify whether they could use a residual approach if there is more than one good or service in the contract with highly variable or uncertain stand-alone selling prices. Those respondents observed that this may occur in contracts that include three or more performance obligations, in which at least one of the performance obligations has an observable stand-alone selling price. The boards decided that even if a contract includes more than one good or service with a highly variable or uncertain stand-alone selling price, an entity should not be prevented from applying the residual approach because it may still be a reliable method for determining the stand-alone selling price. However, the boards observed that using the residual approach when there are two or more goods or services with highly variable or uncertain stand-alone selling prices may require an entity to use a combination of techniques to estimate the stand-alone selling prices as follows:</p><ol id="IFRS15_L0193" base="F31839871" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2525" base="F31839872">apply the residual approach to estimate the aggregate of the stand-alone selling prices for all the promised goods or services with highly variable or uncertain stand-alone selling prices; and</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2526" base="F31839874">then use another technique to estimate the stand-alone selling prices of each of those promised goods or services with highly variable or uncertain stand-alone selling prices.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
