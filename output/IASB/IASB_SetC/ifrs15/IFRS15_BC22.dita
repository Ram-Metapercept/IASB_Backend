However, some respondents requested that the boards instead develop an activities model in which revenue would be recognised as the entity undertakes activities in producing or providing goods or services, regardless of whether those activities result in the transfer of goods or services to the customer. Those respondents reasoned that recognising revenue over time, for example, throughout long-term construction or other service contracts, regardless of whether goods or services are transferred to the customer, would provide users of financial statements with more useful information. </p></body></paragraph>
