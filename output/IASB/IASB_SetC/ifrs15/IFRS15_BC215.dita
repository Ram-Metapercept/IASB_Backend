For example, an entity might estimate revenue from sales of goods with a right of return. In that case, the entity might not practically need to estimate the expected revenue and then apply the constraint requirements to that estimate, if the entity&#x2019;s calculation of the estimated revenue incorporates the entity&#x2019;s expectations of returns at a level at which it is highly probable that the cumulative amount of revenue recognised would not result in a significant revenue reversal.</p></body></paragraph>
