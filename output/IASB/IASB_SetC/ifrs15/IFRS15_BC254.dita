Those previous requirements provided detailed guidance for the measurement and recognition of revenue when the consideration was in the form of shares or share options. However, the FASB decided to remove those requirements because equity instruments are merely another form of non-cash consideration. Therefore, equity instruments received as promised consideration in a contract with a customer would be accounted for consistently with other forms of non-cash consideration.</p></body></paragraph>
