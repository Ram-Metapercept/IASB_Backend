This would include an assessment of whether the customer can benefit from the licence on its own or together with other resources that are readily available (see <xref id="IFRS15_X2157" base="F35619923" href="IFRS15_27.dita#IFRS15_27">paragraph 27(a) of IFRS 15</xref>) and whether the licence is separately identifiable from other goods or services in the contract (see <xref id="IFRS15_X2158" base="F35619924" href="IFRS15_27.dita#IFRS15_27">paragraph 27(b) of IFRS 15</xref>). The boards observed that this assessment may sometimes be challenging because the customer can often obtain benefit from the licence on its own (ie the licence is capable of being distinct). However, in many cases, the customer can benefit from the licence only with another good or service that is also promised (explicitly or implicitly) in the contract; therefore, the licence is not separately identifiable from other goods or services in the contract. This may occur when:</p><ol id="IFRS15_L0219" base="F31840300" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2764" base="F31840301">a licence forms a component of a tangible good and is integral to the good&#x2019;s functionality&#x2014;software (ie a licence) is often included in tangible goods (for example, a car) and in most cases, significantly affects how that good functions. In those cases, the customer cannot benefit from the licence on its own (see <xref id="IFRS15_X2159" base="F35619925" href="IFRS15_27.dita#IFRS15_27">paragraph 27(a) of IFRS 15</xref>) because the licence is integrated into the good (see <xref id="IFRS15_X2160" base="F35619926" href="IFRS15_29.dita#IFRS15_29">paragraph 29(a) of IFRS 15</xref>); that is, the licence is an input to produce that good, which is an output.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2765" base="F31840303">a licence that the customer can benefit from only in conjunction with a related service&#x2014;this may occur when an entity provides a service, such as in some hosting or storage services, that enables the customer to use a licence, such as software, only by accessing the entity&#x2019;s infrastructure. In those cases, the customer does not take control of the licence and, therefore, cannot benefit from (or use) the licence on its own (see <xref id="IFRS15_X2161" base="F35619928" href="IFRS15_27.dita#IFRS15_27">paragraph 27(a) of IFRS 15</xref>) without the hosting service. In addition, the use of the licence is highly dependent on, or highly interrelated with, the hosting service (see <xref id="IFRS15_X2162" base="F35619927" href="IFRS15_29.dita#IFRS15_29">paragraph 29(c) of IFRS 15</xref>).</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
