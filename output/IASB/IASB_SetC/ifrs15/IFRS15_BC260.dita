Although some respondents agreed with the proposal that the transaction price should reflect the customer&#x2019;s credit risk, nearly all respondents (including preparers, users of financial statements and securities regulators) expressed concerns about applying that concept in practice. In particular, many users of financial statements commented that they would prefer revenue to be measured at the &#x2018;gross&#x2019; amount so that revenue growth and receivables management (or bad debts) could be analysed separately. Those users of financial statements indicated that they were interested in assessing the performance of an entity&#x2019;s sales function and receivables collection function separately because those functions are often managed separately. However, that information would not be available if an entity&#x2019;s assessment of sales and collectability were reflected only on a &#x2018;net&#x2019; basis in the revenue line.</p></body></paragraph>
