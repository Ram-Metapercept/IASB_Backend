Since IFRS 15 was issued, some stakeholders have asked when the licensing guidance on determining the nature of an entity&#x2019;s promise applies to a performance obligation that contains a licence and other goods or services. Some held the view that paragraph B55 suggests that an entity would consider the nature of its promise in granting a licence only when the licence is distinct. Others noted that an entity would have to consider the nature of its promise in granting a licence, even when the licence is not distinct, to (a) determine whether a single performance obligation that includes a licence of intellectual property is satisfied over time or at a point in time; and (b) measure progress towards complete satisfaction of that single performance obligation if it is satisfied over time.</p></body></paragraph>
