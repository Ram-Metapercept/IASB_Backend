Consequently, in its Exposure Draft <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Clarifications to IFRS 15</ph></ph>, the IASB proposed to add some new examples, and to amend some of the existing examples that accompany IFRS 15. The FASB decided to propose amendments to Topic 606 to clarify the guidance relating to the identification of performance obligations. In particular, their proposed amendments included expanding the articulation of the &#x2018;separately identifiable&#x2019; principle and reframing the existing factors in paragraph 606&#x2011;10&#x2011;25&#x2011;21 (<xref id="IFRS15_X1875" base="F51967238" href="IFRS15_29.dita#IFRS15_29/IFRS15_29_V2">paragraph 29 of IFRS 15</xref>) to align them with the amended principle.</p></body></paragraph>
