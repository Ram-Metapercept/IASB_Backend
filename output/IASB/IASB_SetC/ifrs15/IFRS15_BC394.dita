The first criterion specifies that the additional goods or services underlying the renewal options must be similar to those provided under the initial contract&#x2014;that is, an entity continues to provide what it was already providing. Consequently, it is more intuitive to view the goods or services underlying such options as part of the initial contract. In contrast, customer loyalty points and many discount vouchers should be considered to be separate deliverables in the contract, because the underlying goods or services may be of a different nature.</p></body></paragraph>
