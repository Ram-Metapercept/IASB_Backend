In other words, the more specific Standard would take precedence in accounting for a part of a contract and any residual consideration should be allocated to the part(s) of the contract within the scope of IFRS 15. This rationale is consistent with the principle in IFRS 15 related to scope, which is that another Standard should be applied to a portion of the contract or arrangement if that Standard provides specific requirements for that portion of the contract or arrangement. The boards&#x2019; decision is also consistent with the requirements for multiple-element arrangements in US GAAP that were replaced by Topic 606. The boards noted that this decision results in any discount in the overall arrangement being allocated to the portion of the arrangement within the scope of IFRS 15.</p></body></paragraph>
