However, the boards decided that an arrangement in which an entity subsequently decides to repurchase a good after transferring control of that good to a customer would not constitute a repurchase agreement as described in <xref id="IFRS15_X2224" base="F35620002" href="IFRS15_B64.dita#IFRS15_B64">paragraph B64 of IFRS 15</xref>. This is because the entity&#x2019;s subsequent decision to repurchase a good without reference to any pre-existing contractual right does not affect the customer&#x2019;s ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the good upon initial transfer. In other words, the customer is not obliged to resell that good to the entity as a result of the initial contract. The boards observed that in those cases, the entity should, however, consider whether the customer obtained control of the good initially and may need to consider the requirements for principal versus agent in <xref id="IFRS15_X2225" base="F35620003" href="IFRS15_gB34-B38.dita#IFRS15_gB34-B38">paragraphs B34&#x2013;B38 of IFRS 15</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
