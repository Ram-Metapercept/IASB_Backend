If those criteria are not met, the licence provides the customer with a right to use an entity&#x2019;s intellectual property as that intellectual property exists (in the form and with the functionality) at the point in time when the licence transfers to the customer. To ensure that all licences are accounted for as either a right of access or a right to use, the boards decided to specify criteria for only one type of licence. In determining for which type of licence they should develop criteria, the boards observed that it was easier to determine when the intellectual property to which the customer has rights was changing (ie was dynamic), rather than when it was static.</p></body></paragraph>
