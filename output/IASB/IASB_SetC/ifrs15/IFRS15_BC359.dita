They explained that requiring all of the quantitative disclosures in interim financial reports would be too burdensome and difficult to achieve in the short time frames required for interim reporting. In contrast, users of financial statements had mixed views. Some users (including nearly all US-based users) suggested that <xref id="IFRS15_X2083" base="F35619806" href="../ias34/IAS34_TOC0001.dita#IAS34_TOC0001">IAS 34</xref> and Topic 270 should be amended to require the quantitative disclosures because of the importance of revenue and the need to have timely disclosures provided regularly in the interim financial reports. However, other users of financial statements explained that only the information about the disaggregation of revenue was critical to their interim analyses. Those users of financial statements also explained that timeliness in interim reporting was critical and that a requirement to provide other interim disclosures might unnecessarily delay the issuance of interim financial reports.</p></body></paragraph>
