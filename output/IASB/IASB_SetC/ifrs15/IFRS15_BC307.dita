Consequently, if the other Standards preclude the recognition of any asset arising from a particular cost, an asset cannot then be recognised under IFRS 15 (for example, in IFRS, initial operating losses, such as those incurred while demand for an item builds, will continue to be accounted for in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X2035" base="F35619643" href="../ias16/IAS16_20.dita#IAS16_20">paragraph 20(b) of IAS 16</xref> and, in US GAAP, pre-production costs under long-term supply arrangements will continue to be accounted for in accordance with paragraphs 340&#x2011;10&#x2011;25&#x2011;5 through 25&#x2011;8 of the Codification).</p></body></paragraph>
