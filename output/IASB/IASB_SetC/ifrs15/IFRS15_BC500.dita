However, the IASB noted that there is diversity in practice in the recognition of the gain or loss when the transfer of those assets involves variable consideration, because the previous revenue Standard in IFRS did not provide specific requirements for variable consideration. The IASB decided that requiring application of the requirements in IFRS 15 for control and for measurement (including constraining the amount of variable consideration used in determining the gain or loss) would eliminate the diversity in practice because the requirements in IFRS 15 provide a clear principle for accounting for variable consideration.</p></body></paragraph>
