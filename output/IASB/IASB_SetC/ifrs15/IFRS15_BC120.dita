Thus, the boards determined that control of a promised good or service (ie an asset) is the customer&#x2019;s ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the asset. The components that make up the description of control are explained as follows:</p><ol id="IFRS15_L0174" base="F31831648" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2304" base="F31831649">ability&#x2014;a customer must have the present right to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, an asset for an entity to recognise revenue. For example, in a contract that requires a manufacturer to produce an asset for a particular customer, it might be clear that the customer will ultimately have the right to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the asset. However, the entity should not recognise revenue until the customer has actually obtained that right (which, depending on the contract, might occur during production or afterwards).</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2305" base="F31831651">direct the use of&#x2014;a customer&#x2019;s ability to direct the use of an asset refers to the customer&#x2019;s right to deploy that asset in its activities, to allow another entity to deploy that asset in its activities, or to restrict another entity from deploying that asset.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2306" base="F31831653">obtain the benefits from&#x2014;the customer must have the ability to obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from an asset for the customer to obtain control of it. Conceptually, the benefits from a good or service are potential cash flows (either an increase in cash inflows or a decrease in cash outflows). A customer can obtain the benefits directly or indirectly in many ways, such as by using, consuming, disposing of, selling, exchanging, pledging or holding an asset.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
