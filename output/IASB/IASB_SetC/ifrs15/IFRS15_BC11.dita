As the redeliberations of those proposals drew to a close, the boards decided to issue a revised Exposure Draft for public comment to provide interested parties with an opportunity to comment on the revisions that the boards had made since the 2010 Exposure Draft was published. The boards decided unanimously that it was appropriate to go beyond their established due process and re&#x2011;expose their revised revenue proposals, because of the importance of revenue to all entities and to avoid unintended consequences in the recognition of revenue for specific contracts or industries. The revised Exposure Draft <i>Revenue from Contracts with Customers</i> was published in November 2011 (the &#x2018;2011 Exposure Draft&#x2019;) and approximately 350 comment letters were received from respondents representing a wide range of industries. As in the case of the 2010 Exposure Draft, the boards and their staffs consulted extensively on the proposals in the 2011 Exposure Draft. This consultation also included all major geographical regions and occurred in a number of formats. Many of the discussions focused on detailed analyses related to the application of the revenue recognition model and the principles in the 2011 Exposure Draft.</p></body></paragraph>
