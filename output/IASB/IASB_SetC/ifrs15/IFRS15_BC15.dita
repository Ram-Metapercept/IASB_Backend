However, even after the changes to US GAAP mentioned in <xref id="IFRS15_X1719" base="SL35363086" href="IFRS15_BC14.dita#IFRS15_BC14">paragraph BC14(a)</xref>, the requirements in US GAAP would have continued to result in inconsistent accounting for revenue and, consequently, would not have provided a robust framework for addressing revenue recognition issues in the future. Furthermore, amending the requirements would have failed to achieve one of the goals of the Revenue Recognition project, which was to develop a common revenue standard for IFRS and US GAAP that entities could apply consistently across industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. Because revenue is a crucial number to users of financial statements, the boards decided that a common standard on revenue for IFRS and US GAAP is an important step toward achieving the goal of a single set of high&#x2011;quality global accounting standards. To be consistent with that goal, the boards noted that previous revenue recognition requirements in IFRS and US GAAP should not be used to supplement the principles in IFRS 15.</p></body></paragraph>
