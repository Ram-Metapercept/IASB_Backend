Conceptually, revenue recognition could occur at the point at which an entity enters into a contract with a customer. For an entity to recognise revenue at contract inception (before either party has performed), the measure of the entity&#x2019;s rights must exceed the measure of the entity&#x2019;s performance obligations. This could occur if the rights and obligations were measured at current exit prices and would lead to revenue recognition because of an increase in a contract asset. However, as described in <xref id="IFRS15_X1721" base="F35363063" href="IFRS15_BC25.dita#IFRS15_BC25">paragraph BC25</xref>, the boards proposed in the Discussion Paper that performance obligations should be measured at the same amount as the rights in the contract at contract inception, thereby precluding the recognition of a contract asset and revenue at contract inception.</p></body></paragraph>
