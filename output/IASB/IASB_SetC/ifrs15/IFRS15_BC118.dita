However, the boards decided that an entity should assess the transfer of a good or service by considering when the customer obtains control of that good or service, for the following reasons:</p><ol id="IFRS15_L0173" base="F31831636" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2299" base="F31831637">Both goods and services are assets that a customer acquires (even if many services are not recognised as an asset because those services are simultaneously received and consumed by the customer), and the boards&#x2019; existing definitions of an asset use control to determine when an asset is recognised or derecognised.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2300" base="F31831639">Assessing the transfer of goods or services using control should result in more consistent decisions about when goods or services are transferred, because it can be difficult for an entity to judge whether an appropriate level of the risks and rewards of ownership of a good or service has been transferred to the customer if the entity retains some risks and rewards.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2301" base="F31831641">A risks-and-rewards approach could conflict with identifying performance obligations. For example, if an entity transfers a product to a customer but retains some risks associated with that product, an assessment based on risks and rewards might result in the entity identifying a single performance obligation that could be satisfied (and therefore revenue would be recognised) only after all the risks are eliminated. However, an assessment based on control might appropriately identify two performance obligations&#x2014;one for the product and another for a remaining service, such as a fixed price maintenance agreement. Those performance obligations would be satisfied at different times.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
