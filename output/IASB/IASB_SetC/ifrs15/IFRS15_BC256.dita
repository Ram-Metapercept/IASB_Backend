Previous requirements in US GAAP on the consideration that a vendor gives to a customer used the term &#x2018;identifiable benefit&#x2019;, which was described as a good or service that is &#x2018;sufficiently separable from the recipient&#x2019;s purchase of the vendor&#x2019;s products such that the vendor could have entered into an exchange transaction with a party other than a purchaser of its products or services in order to receive that benefit&#x2019;. The boards concluded that the principle in IFRS 15 for assessing whether a good or service is distinct is similar to the previous requirements in US GAAP.</p></body></paragraph>
