Paragraph B61 states that &#x2018;&#x2026; revenue cannot be recognised for a licence that provides a right to use the entity&#x2019;s intellectual property before the beginning of the period during which the customer is able to use and benefit from the licence&#x2019;. Some stakeholders asked whether paragraph B61 applies to the renewal of an existing licence or whether the entity could recognise revenue for the renewal when the parties agree to the renewal.</p></body></paragraph>
