<paragraph id="IFRS15_BC390" base="F31840254"><paranum>BC390</paranum><prolog><data name="standard_number" value="IFRS 15"/><data name="paranum" value="BC390"/></prolog><body><p id="IFRS15_P2747">Option pricing models can be used to estimate the stand-alone selling price of an option. The price of an option includes the intrinsic value of the option (ie the value of the option if it were exercised today) and its time value (ie the value of the option that depends on the time until the expiry and the volatility of the price of the underlying goods or services). The boards decided that the benefits to users of financial statements of allocating some of the transaction price to the price and availability guarantees inherent in the time value component of the option price would not have justified the costs and difficulties to do so. However, the boards decided that an entity should be able to readily obtain the inputs necessary to measure the intrinsic value of the option in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X2148" base="F35619885" href="IFRS15_B42.dita#IFRS15_B42">paragraph B42 of IFRS 15</xref> and that those calculations should be relatively straightforward and intuitive. This measurement approach is consistent with the application guidance that was provided for measuring customer loyalty points in previous revenue recognition requirements in IFRS.</p></body></paragraph>
