The notion of a performance obligation is similar to the notions of deliverables, components or elements of a contract in previous revenue Standards. Although the notion of a performance obligation is implicit in previous revenue Standards, the term &#x2018;performance obligation&#x2019; has not been defined previously.</p></body></paragraph>
