For example, in the healthcare industry, an entity may determine the transaction price based on amounts to which it will be entitled to payment from the patient, insurance companies and/or governmental organisations. This may also occur in other industries in which an entity receives a payment from a manufacturer as a result of the manufacturer issuing coupons or rebates directly to the entity&#x2019;s customer. However, it would not include amounts collected on behalf of another party such as some sales taxes and value added taxes in some jurisdictions.</p></body></paragraph>
