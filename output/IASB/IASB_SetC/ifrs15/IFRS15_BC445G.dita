When developing the transition method described in <xref id="IFRS15_X2258" base="F52283101" href="IFRS15_C3.dita#IFRS15_C3">paragraph C3(b)</xref>, the boards considered feedback from users of financial statements and decided to require an entity to provide additional disclosures to help users understand the effect of that transition method on trend information (see <xref id="IFRS15_X2259" base="F52283133" href="IFRS15_BC442.dita#IFRS15_BC442">paragraphs BC442&#x2013;BC443</xref>). The IASB observed that as part of the disclosures required by <xref id="IFRS15_X2260" base="F52283102" href="IFRS15_C8.dita#IFRS15_C8">paragraph C8</xref> an entity could provide additional information about the amount of revenue recognised using previous revenue Standards, if the entity concludes that such information would be helpful to users. In addition, when selecting a transition method, the IASB expects that an entity would consider whether the selected transition method provides useful information to users of its financial statements. If the entity were to conclude that excluding completed contracts from the transition to IFRS 15 would not provide useful information to users, and if that is an important consideration for the entity, then the entity could decide to include completed contracts in its transition to IFRS 15.</p></body></paragraph>
