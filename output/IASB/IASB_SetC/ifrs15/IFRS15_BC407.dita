The entity would then determine when the single performance obligation is satisfied on the basis of when the good or service (ie the output) is transferred to the customer. The boards noted that in some cases the combined good or service transferred to the customer may have a licence as its primary or dominant component. When the output that is transferred is a licence or when the licence is distinct, the entity would apply the criteria in <xref id="IFRS15_X2164" base="F35619960" href="IFRS15_B58.dita#IFRS15_B58">paragraph B58 of IFRS 15</xref> to determine whether the promised licence provides the customer with access to the entity&#x2019;s intellectual property or a right to use the entity&#x2019;s intellectual property.</p></body></paragraph>
