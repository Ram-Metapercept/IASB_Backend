IFRS 15 and the explanatory material in the Basis for Conclusions provide adequate guidance to account for a licence that is combined with another good or service in a single performance obligation. An entity will, however, need to apply judgement to determine the nature of the performance obligation, and to select a method of measuring progress that is consistent with the objective of depicting the entity&#x2019;s performance.</p></body></paragraph>
