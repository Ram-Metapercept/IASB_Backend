The boards had two reasons for developing a standard on revenue that applies only to contracts with customers. First, contracts to provide goods or services to customers are important economic phenomena and are crucial to most entities. Second, most previous revenue recognition requirements in IFRS and US GAAP focused on contracts with customers. The boards decided that focusing on the recognition and measurement of the asset or liability arising from a contract with a customer and the changes in that asset or liability over the life of the contract would bring discipline to the earnings process approach. Consequently, it would result in entities recognising revenue more consistently than they did under previous revenue recognition requirements.</p></body></paragraph>
