As a result, the paragraph numbers of IFRS 15 and Topic 606 are not the same. The wording in most of the paragraphs is consistent because IFRS 15 and Topic 606 were issued in May 2014 as a common revenue standard for IFRS and US GAAP. However, the wording in some paragraphs differs because of the different amendments to IFRS 15 and Topic 606 (see <xref base="F52310734" href="IFRS15_BC_A1A.dita#IFRS15_A1A/IFRS15_A1A_V1" id="IFRS15_X2351">paragraph A1A</xref>). The following table illustrates how the paragraphs of IFRS 15 and Topic 606, and the related illustrative examples, correspond. Paragraphs in which the wording differs are marked with &#x2018;*&#x2019;. The table reflects amendments issued by the FASB, and those expected to be issued by the FASB based on its decisions, until March 2016.</p>     </variant></body></paragraph>
