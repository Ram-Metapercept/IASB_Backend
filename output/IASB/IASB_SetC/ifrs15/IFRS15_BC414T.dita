This is because when the entity and the customer enter into a contract to renew (or extend the period of) an existing licence, the entity will evaluate whether the renewal or extension should be treated as a new licence or, alternatively, as a modification of the existing contract. A modification would be accounted for in accordance with the contract modifications requirements in <xref id="IFRS15_X2197" base="F52282979" href="IFRS15_g18-21.dita#IFRS15_g18-21/IFRS15_g18-21_TI">paragraphs 18&#x2013;21 of IFRS 15</xref>. The IASB noted that, although some diversity may arise, IFRS 15 provides a more extensive framework for applying judgement than its predecessor, IAS 18. Again, having considered the wider implications of amending IFRS 15 before its effective date, the IASB decided that a clarification about the application of the contract modification requirements specifically for renewals of licensing arrangements was not necessary.</p></body></paragraph>
