A customer can direct the use of, and obtain substantially all the benefits from, the intellectual property, if the intellectual property to which the customer has rights is not significantly affected by activities of the entity. In contrast, a customer cannot direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, a licence at the point in time at which the licence is granted if the intellectual property to which the customer has rights changes throughout the licence period. The intellectual property will change when the entity continues to be involved with its intellectual property and undertakes activities that significantly affect the intellectual property to which the customer has rights. <xref id="IFRS15_X2176" base="F52310685" href="IFRS15_B58.dita#IFRS15_B58/IFRS15_B58_V2">Paragraph B58</xref> provides criteria to help an entity assess whether its activities &#x2018;change&#x2019; the intellectual property to which the customer has rights, including whether the expected activities of the entity significantly affect the intellectual property to which the customer has rights.</p></body></paragraph>
