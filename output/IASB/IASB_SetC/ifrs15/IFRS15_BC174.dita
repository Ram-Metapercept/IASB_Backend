The boards disagreed with the concern raised by some respondents that <xref id="IFRS15_X1932" base="F35619282" href="IFRS15_B19.dita#IFRS15_B19">paragraph B19(b) of IFRS 15</xref> is inconsistent with the principle of identifying performance obligations. Although the outcome of applying <xref id="IFRS15_X1933" base="F35619283" href="IFRS15_B19.dita#IFRS15_B19">paragraph B19(b) of IFRS 15</xref> is that some goods or services that are part of a single performance obligation attract a margin, while any uninstalled materials attract only a zero margin, that difference arises only as a consequence of the need to adjust the cost-to-cost calculation so that the input method faithfully depicts the entity&#x2019;s performance in the contract.</p></body></paragraph>
