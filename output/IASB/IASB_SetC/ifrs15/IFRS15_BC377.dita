The law might state that an entity is required to repair or replace products that develop faults within a specified period from the time of sale. Consequently, those statutory warranties may appear to be service-type warranties because they cover faults arising after the time of sale, not merely defects existing at the time of sale. However, the boards decided that the law can be viewed as simply operationalising an assurance-type warranty. In other words, the objective of those statutory warranties is to protect the customer against the risk of purchasing a defective product. But rather than requiring the entity to determine whether the product was defective at the time of sale, the law presumes that if a fault arises within a specified period (which can vary depending on the nature of the product), the product was defective at the time of sale. Consequently, these statutory warranties should be accounted for as assurance-type warranties.</p></body></paragraph>
