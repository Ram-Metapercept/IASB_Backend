However, in other cases, an entity satisfies a performance obligation but does not have an unconditional right to consideration, for example, because it first needs to satisfy another performance obligation in the contract. The boards decided that when an entity satisfies a performance obligation but does not have an unconditional right to consideration, an entity should recognise a contract asset in accordance with IFRS 15. The boards noted that making the distinction between a contract asset and a receivable is important because doing so provides users of financial statements with relevant information about the risks associated with the entity&#x2019;s rights in a contract. That is because although both would be subject to credit risk, a contract asset is also subject to other risks, for example, performance risk.</p></body></paragraph>
