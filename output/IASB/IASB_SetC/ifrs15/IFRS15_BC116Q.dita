There are some similarities between the fact pattern in the example and other contracts with customers that involve project management, the production of customised goods or the manufacture of a series of identical goods. However, an entity should evaluate the nature of its promise(s) to a customer within the context of the contract. <xref id="IFRS15_X1889" base="F51967619" href="IFRS15_gIE48A-IE48C.dita#IFRS15_gIE48A-IE48C/IFRS15_gIE48A-IE48C_TI">Example 10, Case B</xref> illustrates a scenario in which the entity is contractually required to undertake a significant effort to establish a customised production process specifically in order to produce the highly complex, specialised devices for which the customer has contracted. As a result, the entity&#x2019;s promise is to establish and provide a service of producing the contracted devices based on the customer&#x2019;s specifications. In contrast, other manufacturing scenarios may involve the development of a production process that can be used to produce goods for multiple contracts with the same or additional customers. In that case, the contract may not include a promise to establish a customised production process.</p></body></paragraph>
