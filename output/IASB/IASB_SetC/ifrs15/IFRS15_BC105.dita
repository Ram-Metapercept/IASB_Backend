The notion of &#x2018;separately identifiable&#x2019; is based on the notion of separable risks in <xref id="IFRS15_X1851" base="F35363465" href="IFRS15_BC103.dita#IFRS15_BC103">paragraph BC103</xref> (ie whether the risk that an entity assumes to fulfil its obligation to transfer one of those promised goods or services to the customer is a risk that is inseparable from the risk relating to the transfer of the other promised goods or services). The boards observed that determining whether the entity&#x2019;s promise to transfer a good or service is separately identifiable requires judgement, taking into account all of the facts and circumstances. The boards decided to assist entities in making that judgement by including the factors in <xref id="IFRS15_X1852" base="F35363466" href="IFRS15_29.dita#IFRS15_29">paragraph 29 of IFRS 15</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
