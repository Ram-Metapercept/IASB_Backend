Consider, for example, a term licence that permits the customer to show a movie in its theatre six times over the next two years. The restrictions in that example determine the nature of the asset that the entity has obtained (ie six showings of the movie), rather than the nature of the underlying intellectual property (ie the underlying movie).</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2772" base="F31840315">guarantees provided by the entity that it has a valid patent to intellectual property and that it will defend and maintain that patent&#x2014;guarantees that the entity has a valid patent would not be included in the assessment of the criteria for determining the rights provided in a licence, because those promises are part of the entity&#x2019;s representation that the intellectual property is legal and valid (this notion was previously included in the 2011 Exposure Draft).</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
