On the contrary, because the factors are based on the same underlying principle of inseparable risks, the boards noted that in many cases more than one of the factors might apply to a contract with a customer. However, each factor was developed because it may be more applicable for particular contracts or industries. The rationale for each factor is discussed in <xref id="IFRS15_X1854" base="F35363468" href="IFRS15_gBC107-BC108.dita#IFRS15_gBC107-BC108/IFRS15_gBC107-BC108_TI">paragraphs BC107&#x2013;BC112</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
