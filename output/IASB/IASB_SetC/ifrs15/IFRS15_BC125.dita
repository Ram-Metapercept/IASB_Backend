In those cases, the simultaneous receipt and consumption of the asset that has been created means that the customer obtains control of the entity&#x2019;s output as the entity performs and, thus, the entity&#x2019;s performance obligation is satisfied over time. For example, consider an entity that promises to process transactions on behalf of a customer. The customer simultaneously receives and consumes a benefit as each transaction is processed.</p></body></paragraph>
