The requirements therefore preclude an entity from recognising any revenue until the contract is either complete or cancelled or until a subsequent reassessment indicates that the contract meets all of the criteria in <xref id="IFRS15_X1787" base="F36247759" href="IFRS15_g9-45.dita#IFRS15_g9-45/IFRS15_g9-45_TI">paragraph 9 of IFRS 15</xref>. The boards noted that this approach is similar to the &#x2018;deposit method&#x2019; that was previously included in US GAAP and that was applied when there was no consummation of a sale.</p></body></paragraph>
