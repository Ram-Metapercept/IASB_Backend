However, the boards decided that the benefits of accounting for all performance obligations within the scope of the requirements using the same measurement approach outweighed any concerns about using that approach for some types of performance obligations. The boards also noted that a common type of contract with customers that has highly variable outcomes would be an insurance contract, which is excluded from the scope of IFRS 15.</p></body></paragraph>
