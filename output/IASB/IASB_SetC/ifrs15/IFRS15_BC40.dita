Without that requirement, entities might transfer goods or services back and forth to each other (often for little or no cash consideration) to artificially inflate their revenue. Consequently, the boards decided that an entity should not recognise revenue from a non-monetary exchange if the exchange has no commercial substance.</p></body></paragraph>
