However, those previous requirements were limited and industry&#x2011;specific. For example, in US GAAP, revenue recognition for licences differed depending on the industry (for example, franchisors, media and entertainment and software) and often was based on features of the licence (for example, licence period or payment terms). Therefore, the previous revenue recognition requirements did not coalesce into a single principle or rule. In IFRS, previous revenue recognition requirements for licences required revenue to be recognised &#x2018;in accordance with the substance of the agreement&#x2019;. However, because those requirements provided minimal guidance on how an entity should assess the &#x2018;substance of the agreement&#x2019;, there was significant diversity in practice for the accounting for licences.</p></body></paragraph>
