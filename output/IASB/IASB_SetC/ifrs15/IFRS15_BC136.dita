In determining whether the entity is limited practically from directing the asset for another use, the boards decided that an entity should consider the characteristics of the asset that will ultimately be transferred to the customer. This is because, for some assets, it is not the period of time for which the asset has no alternative use that is the critical factor in making the assessment but, instead, whether the asset that is ultimately transferred could be redirected without a significant cost of rework. This may occur in some manufacturing contracts in which the basic design of the asset is the same across all contracts, but the customisation is substantial. Consequently, redirecting the asset in its completed state to another customer would require significant rework.</p></body></paragraph>
