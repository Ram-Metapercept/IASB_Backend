This would be computationally simpler because it eliminates the need to evaluate the effects of modifications before transition to IFRS 15. Under this approach, the amount of consideration allocated to the unsatisfied performance obligations would be the total consideration promised by the customer (including amounts already received) less any amounts already recognised as revenue under previous revenue Standards. Although this might significantly reduce the cost and complexity of applying the transition requirements to contract modifications, the approach was rejected by the boards because it could result in financial information that differed significantly from that under IFRS 15 without the expedient.</p></body></paragraph>
