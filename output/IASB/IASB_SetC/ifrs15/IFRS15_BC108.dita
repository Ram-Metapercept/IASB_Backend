For example, some software development contracts with significant integration services will similarly have promised goods and services that meet the criterion in <xref id="IFRS15_X1856" base="F35363469" href="IFRS15_27.dita#IFRS15_27">paragraph 27(b) of IFRS 15</xref>. However, the boards did not intend for this factor to be applied too broadly to software integration services for which the risk that the entity assumes in integrating the promised goods or services is negligible (for example, a simple installation of software that does not require significant modification). Therefore, to provide some additional clarification for many software&#x2011;type contracts, the boards included the factor in <xref id="IFRS15_X1857" base="F35363470" href="IFRS15_29.dita#IFRS15_29">paragraph 29(b) of IFRS 15</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
