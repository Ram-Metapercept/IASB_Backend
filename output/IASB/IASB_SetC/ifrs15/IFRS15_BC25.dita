Using that approach, an entity would allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract (see <xref id="IFRS15_X1726" base="F33215435" href="IFRS15_BC181.dita#IFRS15_BC181">paragraphs BC181</xref> and <xref id="IFRS15_X1727" base="F33215436" href="IFRS15_BC266.dita#IFRS15_BC266">BC266</xref>). In the Discussion Paper, the boards considered an alternative approach to measure performance obligations directly at current exit prices. However, the boards rejected that approach for the following reasons:</p><ol id="IFRS15_L0156" base="F31827317" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2094" base="F31827318">an entity would have recognised revenue before transferring goods or services to the customer at contract inception if the measure of rights to consideration exceeded the measure of the remaining performance obligations. That would have been a typical occurrence at contract inception, because the transaction price often includes amounts that enable an entity to recover its costs to obtain a contract.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2095" base="F31827320">any errors in identifying or measuring performance obligations could have affected revenue recognised at contract inception.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2096" base="F31827322">a current exit price (ie the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability) for the remaining performance obligations is typically not observable and an estimated current exit price could be complex and costly to prepare and difficult to verify.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
