The FASB observed that applying the variable consideration requirements to both types of variability might not provide users of financial statements with useful information, because the timing of revenue recognition might differ for similar transactions settled in different forms of consideration (for example, cash and shares). Additionally, the inclusion of a minor performance condition could significantly affect the amount of non-cash consideration that would be subject to the constraint on variable consideration.</p></body></paragraph>
