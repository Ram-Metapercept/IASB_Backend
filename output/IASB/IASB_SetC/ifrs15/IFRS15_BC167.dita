This method is appropriate if the amount of consideration that the entity has a right to invoice corresponds directly with the value to the customer of each incremental good or service that the entity transfers to the customer (ie the entity&#x2019;s performance completed to date). This may occur, for example, in a services contract in which an entity invoices a fixed amount for each hour of service provided. </p></body></paragraph>
