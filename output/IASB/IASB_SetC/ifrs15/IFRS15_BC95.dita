Consequently, the boards developed a principle for identifying performance obligations that separates promised goods or services in a relevant way when applied across the various industries and transactions within the scope of IFRS 15. That principle is the notion of a distinct good or service. The term &#x2018;distinct&#x2019;, in an ordinary sense, suggests something that is different, separate or dissimilar. A majority of respondents agreed with using the principle of distinct goods or services to identify the performance obligations in a contract. However, many asked the boards to refine and further clarify the requirements for determining when a good or service is distinct.</p></body></paragraph>
