Consequently, there would not necessarily be a connection between the revenue recognised in a particular reporting period and the impairment losses that would have been presented adjacent to the revenue line item in that period.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2508" base="F31839836">the impairment losses on short-term trade receivables (ie receivables arising from contracts with customers that do not have separately identified financing components) would have been presented differently from all other financial assets that are subject to impairment. This is because the impairment losses for short-term trade receivables would have been presented adjacent to revenue, whereas for all other financial assets, impairment losses would have been presented together with other expense items in the statement of comprehensive income. For the reasons described in <xref id="IFRS15_X2002" base="F35619522" href="IFRS15_gBC244-BC247.dita#IFRS15_gBC244-BC247">paragraphs BC244&#x2013;BC247</xref>, those other financial assets would have included receivables arising from contracts with customers that include a financing component that is significant to the contract.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
