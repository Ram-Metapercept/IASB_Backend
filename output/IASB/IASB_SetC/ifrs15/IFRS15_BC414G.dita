In some cases, the ability of the intellectual property to provide benefit to the customer is derived from the form or functionality of the intellectual property to which the customer has rights and, in other cases, from the value of that intellectual property. If the activities are expected to significantly change the form or functionality of the intellectual property, those activities are considered to significantly affect the customer&#x2019;s ability to obtain benefit from the intellectual property. If the activities do not significantly change the form or functionality, but the ability of the customer to obtain benefit from the intellectual property is substantially derived from, or dependent upon, the entity&#x2019;s activities after the licence is granted, then the activities are also considered to significantly affect the intellectual property (as long as those activities do not result in the transfer of a good or service to the customer). In these cases, it is not necessary for those activities to change the form or functionality of the intellectual property to significantly affect the ability of the customer to obtain benefit from the intellectual property. For example, in some circumstances (eg many licences of brands), the benefit of the intellectual property is derived from its value and the entity&#x2019;s activities to support or maintain that value.</p></body></paragraph>
