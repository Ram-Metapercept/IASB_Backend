Because of the previous diversity in practice in revenue recognition for licences, the addition of the application guidance in IFRS 15 may change practice for some entities. However, the boards observed that the diversity and inconsistencies that previously existed meant that some changes in practice would have occurred regardless of how the boards decided to apply the revenue recognition model to licences.</p></body></paragraph>
