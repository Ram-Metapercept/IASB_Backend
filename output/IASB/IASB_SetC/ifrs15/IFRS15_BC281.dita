Those requirements are largely based on the &#x2018;contract segmentation&#x2019; principle that was included in the 2010 Exposure Draft, which only allowed a discount to be allocated entirely to one or more performance obligations on the basis of goods or services that are priced independently.</p></body></paragraph>
