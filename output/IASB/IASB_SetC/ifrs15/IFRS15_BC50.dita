Those contracts would not affect an entity&#x2019;s financial position or performance until either party performs. In contrast, there could be an effect on an entity&#x2019;s financial position and performance if only one party could terminate a wholly unperformed contract without penalty. For instance, if only the customer could terminate the wholly unperformed contract without penalty, the entity is obliged to stand ready to perform at the discretion of the customer. Similarly, if only the entity could terminate the wholly unperformed contract without penalty, it has an enforceable right to payment from the customer if it chooses to perform.</p></body></paragraph>
