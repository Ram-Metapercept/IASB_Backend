For example, Subtopic 835&#x2011;30 <i>Interest&#x2014;Imputation of Interest</i>, excluded &#x2018;transactions with customers or suppliers in the normal course of business that are due in customary trade terms not exceeding approximately one year&#x2019;. The boards decided to include similar relief in IFRS 15 from the requirements to account for a significant financing component in circumstances in which the period between when the entity transfers the promised goods or services to the customer, and when the customer pays for those goods or services, is one year or less (see <xref id="IFRS15_X1980" base="F35619478" href="IFRS15_63.dita#IFRS15_63">paragraph 63 of IFRS 15</xref>). The boards observed that, as with the other practical expedients in IFRS 15, an entity should apply the practical expedient consistently to similar contracts in similar circumstances.</p></body></paragraph>
