In the FASB&#x2019;s view, measuring non-cash consideration at contract inception is most consistent with the requirements in Topic 606 on determining the transaction price and on allocating the transaction price to performance obligations. The FASB also expects this approach to be typically less costly and less complex to apply in practice than other alternatives.</p></body></paragraph>
