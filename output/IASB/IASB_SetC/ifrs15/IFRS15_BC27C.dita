As a result, the IASB issued <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Clarifications to IFRS 15</ph></ph> in April 2016 making targeted amendments to IFRS 15 with respect to three of the five topics considered&#x2014;identifying performance obligations, principal versus agent considerations and licensing. The IASB concluded that it was not necessary to amend IFRS 15 with respect to the other two topics&#x2014;collectability and measuring non-cash consideration. In respect of the practical expedients, the IASB provided transition relief for modified contracts and completed contracts.</p></body></paragraph>
