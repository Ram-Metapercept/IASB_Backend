US GAAP did not provide specific requirements for how to measure revenue for goods, but it nevertheless restricted the amount of revenue that could be recognised for goods to the amount that was fixed or determinable. IFRS required revenue to be recognised for the transfer of goods and services at the fair value of the consideration received/receivable; but, there was no guidance on how to apply that principle because IFRS 13 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Fair Value Measurement</ph></ph> was not effective until 1 January 2013. Consequently, that principle was not consistently applied. In addition, IFRS contained little guidance on how to measure variable consideration. However, both IFRS and US GAAP indicated that the amount of revenue to be recognised for services should be limited to an amount that could be &#x2018;estimated reliably&#x2019;.</p></body></paragraph>
