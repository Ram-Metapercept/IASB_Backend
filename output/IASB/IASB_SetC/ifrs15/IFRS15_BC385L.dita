The boards observed that the indicators in paragraph 38 are indicators of the point in time at which the customer obtains control of the promised good or service. Accordingly, the indicators in paragraph 38 serve a different purpose than the indicators in paragraph B37. The indicators in paragraph 38 are not intended to indicate whether the customer obtains control of a promised asset&#x2014;within the context of IFRS 15 as a whole, it is assumed that the customer will obtain control of the promised asset at some point&#x2014;instead, they are intended to indicate when the customer has obtained control. In contrast, the indicators in paragraph B37 are intended to indicate whether the entity controls a specified good or service before that good or service is transferred to the customer.</p></body></paragraph>
