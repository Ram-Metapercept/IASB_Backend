For example, the boards acknowledge that for construction contracts, the application of the criteria for when a good or service transfers over time (and thus, is a performance obligation satisfied over time) in IFRS 15 would likely broadly result in the same accounting as required by previous revenue recognition requirements for contracts that met the definition of &#x2018;services&#x2019;. However, the boards observed that the application of IFRS 15 could result in changes for those contracts for which, under previous revenue recognition requirements, it may have been difficult to conclude that the contracted activities were services. This may occur in some manufacturing service contracts and contracts for the construction of residential real estate.</p></body></paragraph>
