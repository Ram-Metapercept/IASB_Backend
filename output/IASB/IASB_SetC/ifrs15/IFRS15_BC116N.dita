Similarly, the boards also noted that the factors are not intended to be criteria that are evaluated independently of the separately identifiable principle. Given the wide variety of revenue arrangements that are within the scope of IFRS 15, the boards expect that there will be some instances for which the factors will be less relevant to the evaluation of the separately identifiable principle. Consequently, entities should consider the objective of the principle, not just the factors provided in paragraph 29 of IFRS 15.</p></body></paragraph>
