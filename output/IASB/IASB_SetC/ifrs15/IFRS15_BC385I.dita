Paragraph BC382 explains that the boards decided to carry over some of the indicators in previous revenue recognition Standards even though those indicators have a different purpose in IFRS 15. In IFRS 15, the indicators support the concepts of identifying performance obligations and the transfer of control of goods or services. Accordingly, the boards had expected that the conclusions about principal versus agent under IFRS 15 could be different in some scenarios from those reached under the previous revenue recognition Standards. Furthermore, the boards observed that, although exposure to risks and rewards alone does not give an entity control, exposure to risks and rewards can be a helpful factor to consider in determining whether an entity has obtained control (see <xref id="IFRS15_X2117" base="F52062290" href="IFRS15_38.dita#IFRS15_38">paragraph 38</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
