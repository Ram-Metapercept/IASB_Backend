The objective of these amendments is to clarify the IASB&#x2019;s intentions when developing the requirements in IFRS 15 but not to change the underlying principles of IFRS 15. Further details are contained in <xref base="F51967148" href="IFRS15_gBC27A-BC27H.dita#IFRS15_gBC27A-BC27H/IFRS15_gBC27A-BC27H_TI" id="IFRS15_X1715">paragraphs BC27A&#x2013;BC27H</xref>. In some cases, the boards made the same amendments to IFRS 15 and Topic 606. In other cases, the boards did not make the same amendments to the standards. The FASB also amended Topic 606 for issues for which the IASB concluded that it was not necessary to amend IFRS 15. The IASB added a further practical expedient to the transition requirements, which the FASB decided not to provide. Accordingly, <xref base="F51967149" href="IFRS15_BC_APPA.dita#IFRS15_BC_APPA/IFRS15_BC_APPA_TI" scope="local" id="IFRS15_X1716">Appendix A <i>Comparison of IFRS 15 and Topic 606</i></xref> to this Basis for Conclusions has been updated to reflect the differences between the amendments to IFRS 15 and the amendments to Topic 606.</p></body></paragraph>
