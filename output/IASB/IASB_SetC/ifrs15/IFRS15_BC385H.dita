The indicators (a) do not override the assessment of control; (b) should not be viewed in isolation; (c) do not constitute a separate or additional evaluation; and (d) should not be considered a checklist of criteria to be met, or factors to be considered, in all scenarios. Considering one or more of the indicators will often be helpful and, depending on the facts and circumstances, individual indicators will be more or less relevant or persuasive to the assessment of control.</p></body></paragraph>
