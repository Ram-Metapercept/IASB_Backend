This is in response to stakeholder concerns that paragraph B57 has contributed to the confusion about whether the reference to change solely refers to changes in the form or functionality of intellectual property or also includes changes in the value of intellectual property. The IASB is of the view that the addition of <xref base="F52282905" href="IFRS15_B59A.dita#IFRS15_B59A/IFRS15_B59A_V1" id="IFRS15_X2184">paragraph B59A</xref> provides clarity about the intended meaning of change in intellectual property, which makes the discussion in paragraph B57 redundant within the context of the application guidance. The discussion in paragraph B57 explained the IASB&#x2019;s logic for the requirements for determining whether an entity&#x2019;s promise to grant a licence provides a customer with either a right to access or a right to use an entity&#x2019;s intellectual property. Accordingly, the IASB has incorporated the content of paragraph B57 into this Basis for Conclusions.</p></body></paragraph>
