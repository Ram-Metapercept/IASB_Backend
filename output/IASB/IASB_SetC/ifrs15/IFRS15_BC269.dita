However, other entities may need to develop processes for estimating selling prices of goods or services that are typically not sold separately. The boards decided that when developing those processes, an entity should consider all reasonably available information on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances. That information might include the following:</p><ol id="IFRS15_L0192" base="F31839856" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2518" base="F31839857">reasonably available data points (for example, a stand-alone selling price of the good or service, the costs incurred to manufacture or provide the good or service, related profit margins, published price listings, third-party or industry pricing and the pricing of other goods or services in the same contract);</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2519" base="F31839859">market conditions (for example, supply and demand for the good or service in the market, competition, restrictions and trends);</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2520" base="F31839861">entity-specific factors (for example, business pricing strategies and practices); and</p></li><li><li_value>(d)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2521" base="F31839863">information about the customer or class of customer (for example, type of customer, geographical region and distribution channel).</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
