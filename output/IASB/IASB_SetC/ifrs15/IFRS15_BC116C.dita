The TRG&#x2019;s discussion highlighted that the concerns raised primarily related to potential changes to practice under US GAAP. Previous revenue Standards under IFRS did not contain similar language to the guidance issued by the staff of the US Securities and Exchange Commission on inconsequential or perfunctory performance obligations. The TRG&#x2019;s discussion also indicated that IFRS stakeholders can understand and apply the requirements of IFRS 15 in this area.</p></body></paragraph>
