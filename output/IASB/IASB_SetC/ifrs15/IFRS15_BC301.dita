To limit the acquisition costs to those that can be clearly identified as relating specifically to a contract, the boards decided that only the incremental costs of obtaining a contract should be included in the measurement of the asset, if the entity expects to recover those costs. The boards decided that determining whether other costs relate to a contract is too subjective.</p></body></paragraph>
