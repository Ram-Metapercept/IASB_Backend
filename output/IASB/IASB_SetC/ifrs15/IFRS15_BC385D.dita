The entity cannot provide the specified good or service to a customer if the entity does not first control the good or service to be provided. If an entity controls the specified good or service before that good or service is transferred to the customer, the entity is the principal in the transaction with the customer. If the entity does not control the specified good or service before that good or service is transferred to a customer, the entity is not a principal in the transaction with the customer. The boards noted that their considerations in this respect are explained in <xref id="IFRS15_X2108" base="F52062204" href="IFRS15_BC380.dita#IFRS15_BC380">paragraph BC380</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
