In addition, the boards included the requirements in <xref id="IFRS15_X1847" base="F35363415" href="IFRS15_28.dita#IFRS15_28">paragraph 28 of IFRS 15</xref> (which were derived from the Basis for Conclusions on the 2011 Exposure Draft) to help an entity apply that criterion and assess whether a customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or together with other resources. Those requirements focus on the notion of economic benefits, which many respondents explained was helpful in assessing whether the customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or together with other resources. The boards noted that, conceptually, any good or service that is regularly sold separately should be able to be used on its own or with other resources. Otherwise, there would be no market for an entity to provide that good or service on a stand-alone basis.</p></body></paragraph>
