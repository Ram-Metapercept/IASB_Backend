The TRG discussed submissions from stakeholders and its discussions on five topics indicated potential differences of views on how to implement the requirements in IFRS 15. Consequently, those topics were discussed by the boards and each board decided to propose targeted amendments to IFRS 15 and Topic 606. The IASB published an Exposure Draft <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Clarifications to IFRS 15</ph></ph> in July 2015. In the light of those proposed amendments, the IASB and the FASB each discussed whether to defer the effective date of the Standard.</p></body></paragraph>
