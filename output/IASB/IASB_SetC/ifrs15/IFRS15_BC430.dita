Although the customer is not obliged to exercise its put option, the fact that it has a significant economic incentive to exercise that right means that it would probably incur a loss if it did not do so. (For example, the repurchase price may be set significantly above the expected market value of the asset at the date of the repurchase. However, the boards observed that an entity should consider factors other than the price when determining that it has a significant economic incentive to exercise its right.) The boards decided that in those cases, the existence of the option effectively restricts the customer&#x2019;s ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the asset. For similar reasons, the boards decided that if the customer has the unconditional right to require the entity to repurchase the asset at a price that is greater than the original sales price, and higher than the expected market value of the asset, the customer does not obtain control of the asset.</p></body></paragraph>
