The discussion informed the boards about potential diversity in stakeholders&#x2019; understanding and indicated that there was a risk of paragraph 29(c) being applied more broadly than intended, resulting in promised goods or services being inappropriately combined and accounted for as a single performance obligation. Stakeholders asked about the application of this factor to scenarios in which one of the promised goods or services is dependent on the transfer of the other, such as a contract for equipment and related consumables that are required for the equipment to function. Some stakeholders suggested that, although the promised goods or services may be capable of being distinct, if one of the goods or services was dependent on the other, the promised goods or services would not be distinct within the context of the contract.</p></body></paragraph>
