The boards observed that this alternative would have made accounting for the contract more complex. In addition, the boards expected that in many cases it would have provided users of financial statements with little additional information, either because the values of goods or services promised are not inherently volatile or because the effect of any volatility that might exist is limited when an entity transfers the goods or services to the customer over a relatively short time. <xref id="IFRS15_X1940" base="F35619317" href="IFRS15_gBC25-BC27.dita#IFRS15_gBC25-BC27">Paragraphs BC25&#x2013;BC27</xref> include additional discussion on rejected measurement approaches.</p></body></paragraph>
