The IASB decided to amend <xref id="IFRS15_X2085" base="F35619808" href="../ias34/IAS34_TOC0001.dita#IAS34_TOC0001">IAS 34</xref> to only add specific requirements that an entity should disclose disaggregated revenue information in interim financial reports. For all other disclosures related to revenue from contracts with customers, the IASB decided that the general principles of <xref id="IFRS15_X2086" base="F35619809" href="../ias34/IAS34_TOC0001.dita#IAS34_TOC0001">IAS 34</xref> should apply. The IASB decided to add to <xref id="IFRS15_X2087" base="F35619840" href="../ias34/IAS34_TOC0001.dita#IAS34_TOC0001">IAS 34</xref> a requirement to disclose disaggregated revenue information because users of financial statements explained that disaggregation was critical to their analyses and because the information is typically already provided in interim financial statements; therefore, the requirement should not result in an entity incurring significant incremental costs. Furthermore, the general principle of IAS 34 to disclose information about an entity&#x2019;s significant changes in financial position and performance should provide users of financial statements with the other information they need about revenue at an interim reporting period. The IASB decided not to make further changes to <xref id="IFRS15_X2088" base="F35619841" href="../ias34/IAS34_TOC0001.dita#IAS34_TOC0001">IAS 34</xref> without a more comprehensive review of the role of disclosure in interim financial reporting.</p></body></paragraph>
