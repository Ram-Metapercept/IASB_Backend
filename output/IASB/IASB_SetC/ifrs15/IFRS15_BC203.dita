This would be the case if the estimate of variable consideration (and consequently the amount of revenue recognised) is too uncertain and, therefore, may not faithfully depict the consideration to which the entity will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services transferred to the customer. In that case, the boards decided that an entity should constrain the estimate of variable consideration to be included in the transaction price.</p></body></paragraph>
