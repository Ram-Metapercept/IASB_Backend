For instance, in accounting for setup costs, an entity applying US GAAP may previously have needed to analogise to the guidance on the deferral of direct loan origination costs in paragraph 310&#x2011;20&#x2011;25&#x2011;2 of the Codification. An entity applying IFRS may have evaluated those costs in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X2032" base="F35619641" href="../ias38/IAS38_TOC0001.dita#IAS38_TOC0001/IAS38_TOC0001_V2">IAS 38 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Intangible Assets</ph></ph></xref>.
