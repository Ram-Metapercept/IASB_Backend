Specifically, that analysis would require the entity to use judgement and consider the factors in <xref id="IFRS15_X1964" base="F35619403" href="IFRS15_57.dita#IFRS15_57">paragraph 57 of IFRS 15</xref> to assess whether it was highly probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur. In other words, the boards did not expect that an entity would need to prepare a quantitative analysis each time it assessed the likelihood of whether a significant revenue reversal could occur. Therefore, the boards concluded that including a confidence level would not result in application of the requirements that is too costly or complex.</p></body></paragraph>
