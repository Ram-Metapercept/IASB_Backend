<paragraph id="IFRS15_BC276" base="F31839887"><paranum>BC276</paranum><prolog><data name="standard_number" value="IFRS 15"/><data name="paranum" value="BC276"/></prolog><body><p id="IFRS15_P2533">The boards observed that IFRS 15 requires an entity to use observable prices when a good or service is sold separately by the entity (which is similar to a vendor-specific objective evidence notion). It is only when a good or service is not sold separately that an entity is required to estimate the stand-alone selling price. In that estimation process, an entity is still required to maximise the use of observable inputs. The boards noted that in the hierarchy in <xref id="IFRS15_X2010" base="F35619560" href="IFRS15_BC275.dita#IFRS15_BC275">paragraph BC275</xref> there is little distinction between third-party evidence and a best estimate of a selling price. For instance, third-party evidence of a selling price might require adjustments to reflect differences in either (a) the good or service (because the third-party price could be for a similar, rather than an identical, good or service) or (b) pricing strategies between the third party and the entity. Therefore, the boards affirmed their decision not to specify a hierarchy in IFRS 15. Instead, the boards decided that it was important to emphasise that an entity should maximise the use of observable inputs when developing estimates of stand-alone selling prices.</p></body></paragraph>
