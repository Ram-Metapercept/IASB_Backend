The IASB noted that, when new Standards are issued, there are always initial questions that arise. Those questions are generally resolved as entities, auditors and others work through them over time, and gain a better understanding of the new requirements. The IASB also considered the effect of any differences between its decisions and those made by the FASB.</p></body></paragraph>
