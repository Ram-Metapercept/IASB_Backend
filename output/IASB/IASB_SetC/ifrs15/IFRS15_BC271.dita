Specifically, in situations in which one or more promised goods or services have a stand-alone selling price that is highly variable or uncertain. In specifying those circumstances, the boards were particularly mindful of the challenges in determining stand-alone selling prices in contracts for intellectual property and other intangible products. In those arrangements, the pricing can be highly variable because there is little or no incremental cost to the entity in providing those goods or services to a customer. In those circumstances, the most reliable way of determining the stand-alone selling price in the contract will often be to use a residual approach. For the same reason, the boards noted that the residual approach might be appropriate in situations in which an entity has not yet established the selling price for a good or service that previously has not been sold on a stand&#x2011;alone basis.</p></body></paragraph>
