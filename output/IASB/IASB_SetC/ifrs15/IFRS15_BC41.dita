The boards also observed that this criterion is important in all contracts (not only non-monetary exchanges) because without commercial substance it is questionable whether an entity has entered into a transaction that has economic consequences. Consequently, the boards decided that all contracts should have commercial substance before an entity can apply the other requirements in the revenue recognition model.</p></body></paragraph>
