Those respondents observed that such methods appear to be output methods and, therefore, questioned whether they would always provide the most appropriate depiction of an entity&#x2019;s performance. The boards observed that such methods may be appropriate in some cases; however, they may not always result in the best depiction of an entity&#x2019;s performance if the performance obligation is satisfied over time. This is because a units-of-delivery or a units-of-production method ignores the work in progress that belongs to the customer. When that work in progress is material to either the contract or the financial statements as a whole, the boards observed that using a units-of-delivery or a units-of-production method would distort the entity&#x2019;s performance because it would not recognise revenue for the assets that are created before delivery or before production is complete but are controlled by the customer.</p></body></paragraph>
