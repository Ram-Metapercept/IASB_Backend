When applying an output method, &#x2018;value to the customer&#x2019; refers to an objective measure of the entity&#x2019;s performance in the contract. However, value to the customer is not intended to be assessed by reference to the market prices or stand-alone selling prices of the individual goods or services promised in the contract, nor is it intended to refer to the value that the customer perceives to be embodied in the goods or services.</p></body></paragraph>
