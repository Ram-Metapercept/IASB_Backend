The boards considered whether they should provide more specific guidance as to when an entity could use a portfolio approach for allocating the transaction price. However, the boards decided not to do so because they were concerned that any further guidance (for example, by including criteria that an entity would need to meet to apply a portfolio approach) might make the practical expedient less useful across entities or jurisdictions.</p></body></paragraph>
