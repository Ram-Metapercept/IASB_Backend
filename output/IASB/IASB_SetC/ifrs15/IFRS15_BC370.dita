The boards considered distinguishing warranties on the basis of when the fault in the products arises; however, respondents explained that such a distinction was not operational. Therefore, the boards decided to distinguish warranties on the basis of whether the warranty provides the customer with a service in addition to the assurance that the related product complies with the agreed-upon specifications. Specifically, the boards decided that when the warranty provides a service (ie a service-type warranty), the warranty should be accounted for as a performance obligation.</p></body></paragraph>
