That information will help users of financial statements understand the types of costs that the entity has recognised as assets and how those assets are subsequently amortised or impaired. The boards also decided that this disclosure was necessary to replace some of the previous disclosure requirements that were superseded by IFRS 15.</p></body></paragraph>
