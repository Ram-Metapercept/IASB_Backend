This often occurs in a credit card arrangement in which an entity provides the credit card holder with points based on the amount of purchases made at other entities (often referred to as &#x2018;merchants&#x2019;). The boards determined that the assessment of whether any loyalty points represent a performance obligation requires an analysis of the facts and circumstances in each arrangement. The boards decided not to provide any further guidance because the issue was specific to the credit card industry and the boards observed that these arrangements are often complex and can vary significantly. Furthermore, the boards noted that IFRS 15 includes all the requirements to enable entities to account for the various arrangements.</p></body></paragraph>
