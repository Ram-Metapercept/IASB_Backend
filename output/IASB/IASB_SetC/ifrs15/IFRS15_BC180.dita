Consequently, the boards decided that in those cases, an entity should recognise revenue for the satisfaction of the performance obligation only to the extent of the costs incurred. (That method is consistent with previous revenue recognition requirements in both IFRS and US GAAP for measuring progress.) However, the boards also decided that an entity should stop using that method when it can reasonably measure its progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. </p></body></paragraph>
