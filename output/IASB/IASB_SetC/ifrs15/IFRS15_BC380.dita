This is because the performance obligations of principals and agents are different. A principal controls the goods or services before they are transferred to a customer. Consequently, the principal&#x2019;s performance obligation is to transfer those goods or services to the customer. Therefore, recognising revenue at the gross amount of the customer consideration faithfully depicts the consideration to which the entity is entitled for the transfer of the goods and services. In contrast, an agent does not control the goods or services before they are transferred to a customer. The agent merely facilitates the sale of goods or services between a principal and the customer. Consequently, an agent&#x2019;s performance obligation is to arrange for another party to provide the goods or services to the customer. Therefore, the transaction price attributable to an agent&#x2019;s performance obligation is the fee or commission that the agent receives for providing those services.</p></body></paragraph>
