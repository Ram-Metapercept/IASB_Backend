The boards decided that it was important to reassess the criteria in those cases, because that change might clearly indicate that the remaining contractual rights and obligations are no longer enforceable. The word &#x2018;remaining&#x2019; in <xref id="IFRS15_X1751" base="F33215486" href="IFRS15_13.dita#IFRS15_13">paragraph 13 of IFRS 15</xref> indicates that the criteria would be applied only to those rights and obligations that have not yet transferred. That is, an entity would not include in the reassessment (and therefore would not reverse) any receivables, revenue or contract assets already recognised.</p></body></paragraph>
