Consequently, the 2011 Exposure Draft viewed the nature of the promised asset in a licence as a right to use an intangible asset that is transferred at a point in time. This is because the boards&#x2019; view at that time was that there is a point at which the customer obtains the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the benefits from, the right to use the intellectual property. However, the 2011 Exposure Draft also explained that revenue may be recognised over time for some contracts that include a licence if that licence is not distinct from other promises in the contract that may transfer to the customer over time.</p></body></paragraph>
