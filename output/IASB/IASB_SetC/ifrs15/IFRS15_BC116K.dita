Although the boards decided not to use this terminology in IFRS 15, the notion of separable risks continues to influence the separately identifiable principle. The evaluation of whether an entity&#x2019;s promise is separately identifiable considers the relationship between the various goods or services within the contract in the context of the process of fulfilling the contract. Therefore, an entity should consider the level of integration, interrelation or interdependence among the promises to transfer goods or services. The boards observed that rather than considering whether one item, by its nature, depends on the other (ie whether two items have a functional relationship), an entity evaluates whether there is a transformative relationship between the two items in the process of fulfilling the contract.</p></body></paragraph>
