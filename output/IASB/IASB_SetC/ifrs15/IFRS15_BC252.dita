Consequently, the boards decided to constrain variability in the estimate of the fair value of the non-cash consideration if that variability relates to changes in the fair value for reasons other than the form of the consideration (ie for reasons other than changes in the price of the non-cash consideration). For example, if an entity is entitled to a performance bonus that is payable in the form of non-cash consideration, the entity would apply the requirements for constraining estimates of variable consideration to the uncertainty of whether the entity will receive the bonus, because that uncertainty is related to something other than the form of the consideration (ie the entity&#x2019;s performance). The boards observed that this principle is not that different from previous revenue recognition requirements under US GAAP for changes in the fair value of equity instruments that are granted as consideration in exchange for goods or services, although those requirements differentiated between the variability on the basis of performance conditions and market conditions (which were defined terms in those requirements).</p></body></paragraph>
