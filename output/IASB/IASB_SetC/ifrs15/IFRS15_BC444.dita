For example, the boards considered requiring a prospective approach that would require entities to apply IFRS 15 only to new contracts or those that are materially modified on or after the date of initial application. However, the boards rejected this approach because prospective application would not result in consistent presentation of existing contracts and new contracts and thus would reduce comparability. In addition, this approach would not provide useful trend information for users of financial statements until existing contracts have been fully satisfied after the date of initial application. Furthermore, the boards observed that this approach would require some entities to incur significant costs of maintaining two accounting systems for contracts that are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 15 and previous revenue Standards in IFRS, until all existing contracts have been completed, which could take many years for entities with long-term contracts.</p></body></paragraph>
