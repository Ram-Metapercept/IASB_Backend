An entity would probably select a method (for example, cost-to-cost) that results in the entity recognising more revenue and expense for the early units produced relative to the later units. That effect is appropriate because of the greater value of the entity&#x2019;s performance in the early part of the contract because, if an entity were to sell only one unit, it would charge the customer a higher price for that unit than the average unit price the customer pays when the customer purchases more than one unit.</p></body></paragraph>
