The TRG&#x2019;s discussion informed the boards that the measurement date for non-cash consideration is unclear and could be interpreted as one of several dates: (a) at contract inception; (b) when the non-cash consideration is received; or (c) at the earlier of when the non-cash consideration is received and when the related performance obligation is satisfied.</p></body></paragraph>
