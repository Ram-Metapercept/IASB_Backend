This is because it is only after the return right expires that the entity will know with certainty how many sales it has made (ie how many sales did not fail). Consequently, the boards decided that an entity should not recognise revenue for the sales that are expected to fail as a result of customers exercising their return rights. Instead, the entity should recognise a liability for its obligation to refund amounts to customers.</p></body></paragraph>
