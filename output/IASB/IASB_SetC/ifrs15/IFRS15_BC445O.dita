To simplify how an entity retrospectively applies IFRS 15 to its contracts with customers, the boards decided to provide an additional practical expedient that would permit an entity to use hindsight when evaluating contract modifications when making the transition to IFRS 15. Consequently, when restating contracts on transition to IFRS 15, an entity could either (a) follow the requirements in paragraphs 20&#x2013;21; or (b) use the new practical expedient in <xref id="IFRS15_X2272" base="F52283142" href="IFRS15_C5.dita#IFRS15_C5/IFRS15_C5_V2">paragraph C5(c) of IFRS 15</xref>. The new practical expedient allows the entity to reflect the aggregate effect of all past contract modifications when identifying the performance obligations, and determining and allocating the transaction price, instead of accounting for the effects of each contract modification separately. The boards observed that the practical expedient would provide some cost relief and yet would result in financial information that closely aligns with the financial information that would be available under IFRS 15 without the expedient.</p></body></paragraph>
