Some respondents asked the boards to clarify the meaning of ordinary activities; however, the boards decided not to provide additional requirements, because the notion of ordinary activities is derived from the definitions of revenue in the boards&#x2019; respective conceptual frameworks. In particular, the IASB&#x2019;s <ph><ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph></ph> description of revenue refers specifically to the &#x2018;ordinary activities of an entity&#x2019; and the definition of revenue in FASB Concepts Statement No. 6 refers to the notion of an entity&#x2019;s &#x2018;ongoing major or central operations&#x2019;. As noted in <xref base="F33215635" href="IFRS15_BC29.dita#IFRS15_BC29" id="IFRS15_X1794">paragraph BC29</xref>, the boards did not reconsider those definitions as part of the Revenue Recognition project.</p></body></paragraph>
