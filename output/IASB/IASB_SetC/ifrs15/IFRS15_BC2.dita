The boards undertook this project because their requirements for revenue needed improvement for the following reasons:</p><ol id="IFRS15_L0147" base="F31826690" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2041" base="F31826691">US GAAP comprised broad revenue recognition concepts and detailed guidance for particular industries or transactions, which often resulted in different accounting for economically similar transactions.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2042" base="F31826697">the previous revenue Standards in IFRS had different principles and were sometimes difficult to understand and apply to transactions other than simple ones. In addition, IFRS had limited guidance on important topics such as revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements. Consequently, some entities that were applying IFRS referred to parts of US GAAP to develop an appropriate revenue recognition accounting policy.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2043" base="F31826699">the disclosures required under both IFRS and US GAAP were inadequate and often did not provide users of financial statements with information to sufficiently understand revenue arising from contracts with customers.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
