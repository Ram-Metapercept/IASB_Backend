The boards observed that applying the principle in <xref id="IFRS15_X1878" base="F51967430" href="IFRS15_27.dita#IFRS15_27/IFRS15_27_V2">paragraph 27(b)</xref> requires judgement, taking into account facts and circumstances (see <xref id="IFRS15_X1879" base="F51967428" href="IFRS15_BC105.dita#IFRS15_BC105">paragraph BC105</xref>). Even after amending the factors in paragraph 29 of IFRS 15, the boards recognise that judgement will be needed to determine whether promised goods or services are distinct within the context of the contract.</p></body></paragraph>
