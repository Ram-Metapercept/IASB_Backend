However, the boards decided that to demonstrate compensation for performance completed to date, the compensation should be based on a reasonable proportion of the entity&#x2019;s expected profit margin or be a reasonable return on the entity&#x2019;s cost of capital. Furthermore, the boards noted that the focus should be on the amount to which the entity would be entitled upon termination rather than the amount to which the entity might ultimately be willing to settle for in a negotiation. Consequently, the boards clarified their intention about what a &#x2018;reasonable profit margin&#x2019; is intended to represent in <xref id="IFRS15_X1908" base="F51967677" href="IFRS15_B9.dita#IFRS15_B9">paragraph B9 of IFRS 15</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
