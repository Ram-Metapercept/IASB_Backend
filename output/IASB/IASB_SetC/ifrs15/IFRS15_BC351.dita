In addition, the disclosure may include less information than the entity previously included in its backlog disclosure because future and cancellable executory contracts are excluded from the scope of the disclosure.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2648" base="F31840108">the information appeared to be forward-looking in nature and thus should not be presented in the notes to the financial statements.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
