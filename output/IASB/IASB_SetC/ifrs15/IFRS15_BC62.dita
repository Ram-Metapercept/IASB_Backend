The boards disagreed with that view. In the boards&#x2019; view, IFRS 15 provides them with a framework for considering revenue issues in other standard-setting projects. The boards decided that, within the context of those other projects, a different basis of accounting for those contracts with customers might provide users of financial statements with more relevant information.</p></body></paragraph>
