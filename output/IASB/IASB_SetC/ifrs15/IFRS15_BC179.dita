Some asked whether an entity&#x2019;s inability to measure progress would mean that costs would also be deferred. However, the boards observed that unless the entity can recognise an asset from the costs to fulfil a contract in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X1936" base="F35619315" href="IFRS15_95.dita#IFRS15_95">paragraph 95 of IFRS 15</xref>, those costs would not represent an asset of the entity and, therefore, should be recognised as expenses as they are incurred. </p></body></paragraph>
