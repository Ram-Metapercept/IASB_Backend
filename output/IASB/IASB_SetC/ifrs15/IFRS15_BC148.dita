In cases in which the customer clearly receives benefits as the entity performs, as in many service contracts, the possibility that the entity will ultimately not retain the payment for its performance is addressed in the measurement of revenue. For example, in some service contracts in which the customer simultaneously receives and consumes benefits as the entity performs, the customer may be able to terminate the contract and receive a full refund of any consideration paid. The boards decided that in those cases, because the entity is transferring services to the customer, it should recognise revenue subject to an assessment of whether it should constrain the amount of the transaction price to which it is entitled (see <xref id="IFRS15_X1911" base="F35619155" href="IFRS15_gBC203-BC223.dita#IFRS15_gBC203-BC223">paragraphs BC203&#x2013;BC223</xref>).</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
