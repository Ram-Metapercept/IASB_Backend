The boards noted that undertaking a separate project would mean that changes to existing Standards would not be made until that project had been completed and became effective. Because of the boards&#x2019; other standard-setting priorities, and the time required to complete all relevant due process steps for issuing a standard, it might be several years before the existing requirements were replaced. The boards observed that the implications of not proceeding with the proposed consequential amendments would have been as follows:</p><ol base="F31852591" id="IFRS15_L0252" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p base="F31852592" id="IFRS15_P3048">for IFRS reporters, the IASB would have needed to amend <xref base="F36247863" href="../ias16/IAS16_TOC.dita#IAS16_TOC0001/IAS16_TOC0001_V2" id="IFRS15_X2302">IAS 16</xref>, <xref base="F36247943" href="../ias38/IAS38_TOC0001.dita#IAS38_TOC0001/IAS38_TOC0001_V2" id="IFRS15_X2303">IAS 38</xref> and <xref base="F35620198" href="../ias40/IAS40_TOC0001.dita#IAS40_TOC0001" id="IFRS15_X2304">IAS 40</xref> to include the revenue recognition criteria from previous revenue Standards in IFRS.

In addition, no specific requirements would have been provided in US GAAP for transfers of non-financial assets (other than real estate) within the scope of Subtopic 360&#x2011;10 (for example, equipment) or Topic 350 (for example, intangible assets).</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
