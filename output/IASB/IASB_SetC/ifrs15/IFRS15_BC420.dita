Conversely, when a performance obligation is satisfied over time, the initial recognition of some but not all of the estimate of variable consideration would be affected by the entity&#x2019;s future performance, so future adjustments to the transaction price would provide useful information because they explain whether the entity&#x2019;s subsequent performance was beneficial (ie the minimum amount is increased) or detrimental (ie the minimum amount is subject to an unexpected reversal). However, the boards rejected this approach because it would have added complexity to the model that would outweigh the benefit.</p></body></paragraph>
