The boards observed that when either criterion (a) or (b) in <xref id="IFRS15_X1819" base="F35363119" href="IFRS15_g17-17.dita#IFRS15_g17-17/IFRS15_g17-17_TI">paragraph 17 of IFRS 15</xref> is met, the relationship between the consideration in the contracts (ie the price interdependence) is such that if those contracts were not combined, the amount of consideration allocated to the performance obligations in each contract might not faithfully depict the value of the goods or services transferred to the customer. The boards decided to include the criterion in <xref id="IFRS15_X1820" base="F35363120" href="IFRS15_g17-17.dita#IFRS15_g17-17/IFRS15_g17-17_TI">paragraph 17(c) of IFRS 15</xref> to avoid the possibility that an entity could effectively bypass the requirements for identifying performance obligations depending on how the entity structures its contracts.</p></body></paragraph>
