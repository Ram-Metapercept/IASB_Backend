Some of that application guidance has been included based on previous requirements in IFRS or US GAAP that arose as a result of entities requesting clarification in more complex areas of revenue recognition. However, to be consistent with the objective of developing a single revenue recognition model, the boards did not provide requirements that would have applied only to specific industries (see <xref id="IFRS15_X2090" base="F35619843" href="IFRS15_gBC2-BC3.dita#IFRS15_gBC2-BC3">paragraphs BC2&#x2013;BC3</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
