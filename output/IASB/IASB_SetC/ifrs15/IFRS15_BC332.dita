The FASB noted that in the absence of a general financial statement presentation standard, it would require an entity to present or disclose the amount of revenue recognised from contracts with customers. However, the IASB noted that the general principles of <xref base="F35619686" href="../ias01/IAS01_TOC.dita#IAS01_TOC0001" id="IFRS15_X2053">IAS 1</xref> would apply and, therefore, an entity would need to disclose the amount of revenue recognised from contracts with customers in the notes to the financial statements only if it was not otherwise presented.</p></body></paragraph>
