This is because doing so would capture arrangements for which the boards previously concluded that the royalties constraint should not apply (for example, sales of intellectual property or sales of tangible goods that include intellectual property). As noted in <xref id="IFRS15_X2211" base="F52283020" href="IFRS15_BC416.dita#IFRS15_BC416">paragraphs BC416</xref> and <xref id="IFRS15_X2212" base="F52283052" href="IFRS15_BC421.dita#IFRS15_BC421">BC421</xref>, the royalties constraint is intended to apply only to limited circumstances involving licences of intellectual property and, therefore, entities cannot apply it by analogy to other types of transactions.</p></body></paragraph>
