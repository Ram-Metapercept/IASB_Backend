Consequently, if the entity&#x2019;s activities do not significantly change the form or functionality of such intellectual property, then the entity&#x2019;s activities will not significantly affect the customer&#x2019;s ability to derive benefit from that intellectual property. Therefore, the IASB clarified that in these cases the criterion in <xref id="IFRS15_X2182" base="F52282903" href="IFRS15_B58.dita#IFRS15_B58/IFRS15_B58_V2">paragraph B58(a)</xref> would not be met and the licence would be a right to use the intellectual property as it existed at the time that it was transferred.</p></body></paragraph>
