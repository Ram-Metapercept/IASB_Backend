The entity then assesses whether the objective of the requirements for constraining estimates of variable consideration can be met&#x2014;that is by determining whether it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. If the entity determines that it is highly probable that the inclusion of its estimate will not result in a significant revenue reversal, that amount is included in the transaction price.</p></body></paragraph>
