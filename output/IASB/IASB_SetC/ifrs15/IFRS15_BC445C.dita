They were unclear whether the boards intended that any previously unrecognised revenue from a completed contract that is not transitioned to IFRS 15 would continue to be accounted for in accordance with the previous revenue Standards. In addition, referring to the words &#x2018;transferred all of the goods or services&#x2019; in the definition of a completed contract, they commented that: </p><ol id="IFRS15_L0236" base="F48709085" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2912" base="F48709086"><i>transfer</i> of goods or services is a notion that is introduced in IFRS 15 and does not exist in previous revenue Standards.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2913" base="F48709088">it is unclear how an entity would continue to account for a completed contract in accordance with the previous revenue Standards, which would be withdrawn once IFRS 15 becomes effective.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2914" base="F48709090">the boards&#x2019; considerations explained in <xref id="IFRS15_X2254" base="F52283097" href="IFRS15_BC444.dita#IFRS15_BC444">paragraph BC444</xref> for rejecting a prospective transition method do not support the use of the previous revenue Standards once IFRS 15 becomes effective. As explained in paragraph BC444, one of the reasons for rejecting prospective transition methods was the &#x2018;significant costs of maintaining two accounting systems&#x2026;until all existing contracts have been completed, which could take many years for entities with long-term contracts&#x2019;.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
