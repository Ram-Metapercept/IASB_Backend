This is mainly because the FASB had observed that the situations in which an entity that is a principal is (and expects to remain) unaware of the amount charged by an intermediary that is an agent to the end customer are not pervasive and the issue affects only a limited number of entities and contracts. For those limited situations, the FASB is of the view that the determination of whether revenue may be estimated is based on an assessment of the requirements for determining the transaction price and estimating variable consideration.</p></body></paragraph>
