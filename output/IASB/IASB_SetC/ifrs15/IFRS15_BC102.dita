As an example, many construction-type and production-type contracts involve transferring to the customer many goods and services that are capable of being distinct (such as various building materials, labour and project management services). However, identifying all of those individual goods and services as separate performance obligations would be impractical and, more importantly, it would neither faithfully represent the nature of the entity&#x2019;s promise to the customer nor result in a useful depiction of the entity&#x2019;s performance. This is because it would result in an entity recognising and measuring revenue when the materials and other inputs to the construction or production process are provided, instead of recognising and measuring revenue when the entity performs (and uses those inputs) in the construction or production of the item (or items) for which the customer has contracted. Consequently, the boards decided that, when identifying whether goods or services are distinct, an entity should not only consider the characteristics of an individual good or service (see <xref id="IFRS15_X1848" base="F35363462" href="IFRS15_27.dita#IFRS15_27">paragraph 27(a) of IFRS 15</xref>) but should also consider whether the promise to transfer the good or service is separately identifiable (ie distinct within the context of the contract, see <xref id="IFRS15_X1849" base="F35363463" href="IFRS15_27.dita#IFRS15_27">paragraph 27(b) of IFRS 15</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
