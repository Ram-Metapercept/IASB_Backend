Some may observe that the overall volume of disclosure has increased compared with previous revenue disclosure requirements. However, the boards observed that, to some extent, concerns about the increased volume were the inevitable consequence of addressing the shortcoming in the previous disclosure requirements. In addition, the boards noted that many entities provide voluntary revenue disclosures outside the financial statements and the boards concluded that the increase in disclosure is necessary to improve previous disclosure practices and the usefulness of financial reporting.</p></body></paragraph>
