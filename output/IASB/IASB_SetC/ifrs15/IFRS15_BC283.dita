This is because an entity could demonstrate that a discount relates to two or more performance obligations when it has observable information supporting the stand-alone selling price of a group of those promised goods or services when they are sold together. The boards noted that it may be possible for an entity to have sufficient evidence to be able to allocate a discount to only one performance obligation in accordance with the criteria in <xref id="IFRS15_X2016" base="F35619566" href="IFRS15_82.dita#IFRS15_82">paragraph 82</xref>, but the boards expected that this could only occur in rare cases.</p></body></paragraph>
