However, the boards decided against using that terminology to avoid the implication that an entity must assess the customer&#x2019;s intended use for the promised goods or services in identifying the performance obligations in a contract. The boards observed that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for an entity to know the customer&#x2019;s intentions in a given contract.</p></body></paragraph>
