The boards acknowledged that this choice might result in a decrease in comparability between entities. However, the boards observed that applying the transition method described in paragraph C3(b) to all contracts, including completed contracts, at the date of initial application could result in financial information that is more comparable with financial information provided by entities using the transition method described in <xref id="IFRS15_X2265" base="F52283137" href="IFRS15_C3.dita#IFRS15_C3">paragraph C3(a)</xref>. Furthermore, the IASB observed that any decrease in comparability between entities because of the choice will be transitory.</p></body></paragraph>
