This is because the boards decided to eliminate the restrictive, industry-specific requirements in US GAAP for allocating consideration in software arrangements (ie the requirement to have vendor&#x2011;specific objective evidence for all elements in the arrangements before consideration can be allocated). Instead, IFRS 15 requires an entity to estimate the stand-alone selling price of a good or service, if the stand-alone selling price is not directly observable. The boards observed that this change would permit an entity in the software industry to better depict performance by recognising revenue for performance obligations when they are satisfied, instead of when all performance in a contract is complete. In some instances, the boards observed that this may permit entities to eliminate the disclosure of non-GAAP measures that were created because the outcomes from applying previous revenue recognition requirements did not faithfully depict an entity&#x2019;s performance.</p></body></paragraph>
