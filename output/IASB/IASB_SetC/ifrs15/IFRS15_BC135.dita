This is because the entity would incur significant costs to reconfigure the asset for sale to another customer (or would need to sell the asset for a significantly reduced price). In that case, the customer could be regarded as receiving the benefit of that performance and, consequently, as having control of the goods or services (ie the asset being created) as the performance occurs. (However, an entity would also need to consider whether a right to payment exists to conclude that control transfers over time, see <xref id="IFRS15_X1902" base="F35363572" href="IFRS15_BC142.dita#IFRS15_BC142">paragraphs BC142&#x2013;BC148</xref>.)</p></body></paragraph>
