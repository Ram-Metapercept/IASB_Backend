However, a number of respondents explained that this might have required an entity to adjust for the time value of money when the parties did not contemplate a financing arrangement as part of the negotiated terms of the contract. Those respondents explained that, in some cases, although there is a significant period of time between the transfer of the goods or services and the payment, the reason for that timing difference is not related to a financing arrangement between the entity and the customer. The boards agreed with those respondents and clarified their intention by specifying in <xref id="IFRS15_X1976" base="F35619443" href="IFRS15_g60-65.dita#IFRS15_g60-65">paragraph 60 of IFRS 15</xref> that an entity should adjust for financing only if the timing of payments specified in the contract provides the customer or the entity with a significant benefit of financing.</p></body></paragraph>
