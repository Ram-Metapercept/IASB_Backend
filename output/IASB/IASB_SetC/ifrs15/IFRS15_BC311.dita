Conversely, the IASB decided that the impairment charge should be reversed in those circumstances under IFRS. The boards acknowledged that this would result in entities accounting differently for those contract costs using IFRS and US GAAP. However, the boards decided that it is important for the requirements to be consistent with their respective impairment models for other types of assets and those impairment models differ in their accounting for reversals of impairments.</p></body></paragraph>
