If an entity does not recognise a performance obligation for the return right service, it should recognise all of the revenue and margin in the contract once the customer obtains control of the good. That outcome might not faithfully depict the entity&#x2019;s performance under the contract. However, the boards noted that accounting for the return right service as a performance obligation, in addition to the refund liability, would typically require the entity to estimate the stand-alone selling price of that service. Because, in many cases, the number of returns is expected to be only a small percentage of the total sales and the return period is often short (such as 30 days), the boards decided that the incremental information provided to users of financial statements by accounting for the return right service as a performance obligation would not have justified the complexities and costs of doing so. Consequently, the boards decided that the return right service should not be accounted for as a performance obligation.</p></body></paragraph>
