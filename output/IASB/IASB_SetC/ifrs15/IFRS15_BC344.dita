They did this because many users of financial statements observed that information about contract balances would be particularly important for entities that enter into long&#x2011;term contracts with customers or that carry significant contract liability balances for other reasons (for example, prepaid service contracts). However, the boards rejected this alternative for the following reasons:</p><ol id="IFRS15_L0204" base="F31840078" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2632" base="F31840079">it would have been difficult to clearly identify the types of contracts or industries for which a reconciliation would (or would not) provide useful information.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2633" base="F31840081">limiting the scope of the reconciliation would have added complexity. This is because limiting the scope could have resulted in excluding some of an entity&#x2019;s contract assets and contract liabilities from the reconciliation and, therefore, additional information would have been required to relate the reconciled amounts of contract assets or contract liabilities to those recognised in the statement of financial position.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2634" base="F31840083">information on contract balances is useful for other contracts, in addition to long-term contracts, because, for example, there may be a number of contracts or businesses that have significant timing differences between payment and performance.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
