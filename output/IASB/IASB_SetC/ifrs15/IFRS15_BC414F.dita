The IASB noted that the reference to form or functionality in <xref id="IFRS15_X2179" base="F52282900" href="IFRS15_B61.dita#IFRS15_B61">paragraph B61</xref> (and the Illustrative Examples and the Basis for Conclusions) was not intended to suggest that the nature of a licence is a right to access intellectual property only if the entity&#x2019;s activities significantly affect the form or functionality of the intellectual property to which the customer has rights. Determining the nature of a licence is defined by the criteria in <xref id="IFRS15_X2180" base="F52282902" href="IFRS15_B58.dita#IFRS15_B58/IFRS15_B58_V2">paragraph B58</xref>, which do not refer to form or functionality.</p></body></paragraph>
