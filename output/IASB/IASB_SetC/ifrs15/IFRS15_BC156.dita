However, the boards decided not to include this indicator in IFRS 15, because it would apply mainly to service contracts (for example, construction-type contracts) and it would be unnecessary in the light of the requirements for determining when performance obligations are satisfied over time. As described in <xref id="IFRS15_X1920" base="F35619242" href="IFRS15_gBC134-BC141.dita#IFRS15_gBC134-BC141">paragraphs BC134&#x2013;BC141</xref>, the notion of customer-specific design or function has been developed into the criterion of &#x2018;an asset with no alternative use to the entity&#x2019;.</p></body></paragraph>
