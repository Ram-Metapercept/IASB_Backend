The FASB made further amendments regarding some other requirements on identifying performance obligations. In relation to licensing, the boards made the same clarifying amendments for sales&#x2011;based and usage&#x2011;based royalties. The boards decided to make different amendments to the application guidance relating to identifying the nature of an entity&#x2019;s promise in granting a licence. The FASB also decided to amend Topic 606 for other issues relating to licensing for which the IASB decided not to make any amendments to IFRS 15. The FASB has also decided (a) to amend Topic 606 with respect to collectability and measuring non&#x2011;cash consideration and (b) to provide an accounting policy election to present all sales taxes on a net basis. The FASB decided to provide similar transition relief to that provided in IFRS 15 for contract modifications. However, with respect to completed contracts, the FASB decided to (a) amend the definition of a completed contract; and (b) provide transition relief, similar to the relief provided by the IASB, only for entities that apply Topic 606 in accordance with paragraph 606&#x2011;10&#x2011;65&#x2011;1(d)(2) (equivalent to <xref id="IFRS15_X1729" base="F51967191" href="IFRS15_C3.dita#IFRS15_C3">paragraph C3(b) of IFRS 15</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
