Those indicators were also proposed in the 2010 and the 2011 Exposure Drafts and respondents generally agreed that the indicators were relevant and helpful. In their redeliberations, the boards also decided to add an indicator in <xref id="IFRS15_X1966" base="F35619404" href="IFRS15_57.dita#IFRS15_57">paragraph 57(d) of IFRS 15</xref> to address the circumstances in which there is no explicit requirement to adjust the price stated in the contract, but the entity has a past practice of offering a broad range of price concessions (or similar types of price adjustments). This is because the boards observed that a practice of offering a broad range of price concessions would increase the probability that a significant revenue reversal would occur if the entity included the contractual amount of consideration in the transaction price.</p></body></paragraph>
