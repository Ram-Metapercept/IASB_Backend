To attain that objective, the boards try to ensure that new requirements meet a significant need and that the overall benefits to economic decision-making that would result from improved financial reporting justify the costs of providing such information. For example, the boards consider the comparative advantage that preparers have in developing information, compared with the costs that users of financial statements would incur to develop surrogate information. In this evaluation, the boards recognise that the costs of implementing a new standard might not be borne evenly by participants in the financial reporting system. However, both the users of financial statements and the entities that prepare those financial statements benefit from improvements in financial reporting that facilitate the functioning of markets for capital, including credit and the efficient allocation of resources in the economy.</p></body></paragraph>
