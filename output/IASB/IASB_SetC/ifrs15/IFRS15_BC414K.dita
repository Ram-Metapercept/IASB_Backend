The IASB is of the view that stakeholder concerns have been addressed adequately by providing greater clarity about how to apply the requirements within the Standard. The IASB acknowledge that, in some cases, the outcome of using its clarified approach may differ from the outcome achieved using the alternative approach contained in the amendments issued by the FASB (see <xref id="IFRS15_X2185" base="F52282906" href="IFRS15_gBC414L-BC414N.dita#IFRS15_gBC414L-BC414N/IFRS15_gBC414L-BC414N_TI">paragraphs BC414L&#x2013;BC414N</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
