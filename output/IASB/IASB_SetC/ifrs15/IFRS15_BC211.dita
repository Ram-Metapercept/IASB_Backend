In contrast, the term &#x2018;probable&#x2019; is defined in IFRS as &#x2018;more likely than not&#x2019; (<xref base="F35619398" href="../ifrs05/IFRS05_TOC.dita#IFRS05_TOC0001" id="IFRS15_X1961">IFRS 5 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations</ph></ph></xref> and <xref base="F35619399" href="../ias37/IAS37_TOC.dita#IAS37_TOC0001" id="IFRS15_X1962">IAS 37 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets</ph></ph></xref>). Therefore, to achieve the same meaning in IFRS as US GAAP, the boards decided to use the term &#x2018;highly probable&#x2019; for IFRS purposes and &#x2018;probable&#x2019; for US GAAP purposes. The boards noted that this is consistent with the approach that the IASB adopted in developing IFRS 5, for which the IASB used the term &#x2018;highly probable&#x2019; to achieve the same meaning as &#x2018;probable&#x2019; in US GAAP (see <xref base="F35619400" href="../ifrs05/IFRS05_BC81.dita#IFRS05_BC81/IFRS05_BC81_V2" id="IFRS15_X1963">paragraph BC81 of IFRS 5</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
