<paragraph id="IFRS15_BC244" base="F31839797"><paranum>BC244</paranum><prolog><data name="standard_number" value="IFRS 15"/><data name="paranum" value="BC244"/></prolog><body><p id="IFRS15_P2477">As a result of the boards&#x2019; decision on the existence of a significant financing component (see <xref id="IFRS15_X1985" base="F35619481" href="IFRS15_BC229.dita#IFRS15_BC229">paragraphs BC229&#x2013;BC243</xref>), a contract with a customer that has a significant financing component would be separated into a revenue component (for the notional cash sales price) and a loan component (for the effect of the deferred or advance payment terms). Consequently, the accounting for a trade receivable arising from a contract that has a significant financing component should be comparable to the accounting for a loan with the same features. Consider the following example: Customer A purchases a good on credit and promises to pay CU1,000 in three years. The present value of this trade receivable is CU751. Now consider Customer B who borrows CU751 from a bank with a promise to pay CU1,000 in three years. Customer B uses the loan to purchase the same good as Customer A. Economically, those transactions are the same, but, in the absence of the requirements in IFRS 15 to account for a significant financing component, the form of the transaction would determine whether an entity would recognise revenue of CU751 or CU1,000 (ie on a discounted or an undiscounted basis). For this reason, <xref id="IFRS15_X1986" base="F35619482" href="IFRS15_g60-65.dita#IFRS15_g60-65">paragraphs 60&#x2013;65 of IFRS 15</xref> require a contract with a financing component that is significant to the contract to be separated, which results in the same revenue recognition for both transactions.</p></body></paragraph>
