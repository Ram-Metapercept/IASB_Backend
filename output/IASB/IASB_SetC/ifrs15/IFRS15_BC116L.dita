This clarification emphasises that the separately identifiable principle is applied within the context of the bundle of promised goods or services in the contract rather than within the context of each individual promised good or service. The separately identifiable principle is intended to identify when an entity&#x2019;s performance in transferring a bundle of goods or services in a contract is fulfilling a single promise to a customer. Accordingly, the boards revised the wording to emphasise that an entity should evaluate whether two or more promised goods or services each significantly affect the other (and, therefore, are highly interdependent or highly interrelated) in the contract. Furthermore, the boards concluded that it may be clearer to structure those factors to identify when the promises in a bundle of promised goods or services are <i>not</i> separately identifiable and, therefore, constitute a single performance obligation.</p></body></paragraph>
