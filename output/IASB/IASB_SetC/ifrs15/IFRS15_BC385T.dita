Accordingly, the IASB did not view the inclusion of that additional paragraph as essential to clarifying the requirements in IFRS 15. In its view, clarity about the thought process to be applied could have been achieved by amending only the Illustrative Examples. Nonetheless, given the concerns raised by stakeholders, the IASB concluded that including paragraph B34A would be helpful to the principal versus agent evaluation, and would align the wording of the amendments with the wording of those made by the FASB. Therefore, the IASB concluded that the benefits of adding the paragraph outweigh the potential costs of amending the requirements.</p></body></paragraph>
