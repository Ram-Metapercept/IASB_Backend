In reaching its decision to require retrospective application, the IASB observed that the amendments were intended to clarify the IASB&#x2019;s intentions when developing the requirements in IFRS 15 rather than to change the underlying principles of IFRS 15. The IASB decided not to allow prospective application of the amendments because that would reduce comparability in the limited cases that the amendments may have resulted in significant changes to an entity&#x2019;s application of IFRS 15. This is consistent with feedback received from users of financial statements during the development of IFRS 15 highlighting that retrospective application would be the most useful transition method for them to understand trends in revenue.</p></body></paragraph>
