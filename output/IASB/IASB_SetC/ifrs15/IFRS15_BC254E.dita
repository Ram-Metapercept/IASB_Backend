Consequently, it is possible that diversity between IFRS and US GAAP entities could arise in practice. The IASB observed that, unlike US GAAP, existing IFRS does not contain any specific requirements about the measurement date for non-cash consideration for revenue transactions. In addition, discussions with some stakeholders highlighted that any practical effect of different measurement dates would arise in only limited circumstances. The IASB also noted that <xref id="IFRS15_X1996" base="F52062156" href="IFRS15_126.dita#IFRS15_126">paragraph 126 of IFRS 15</xref> requires an entity to disclose information about the methods, inputs and assumptions used for measuring non-cash consideration.</p></body></paragraph>
