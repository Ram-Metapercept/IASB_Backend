Thus, the individual goods or services are inputs to produce a single output. The boards observed that this factor may be relevant in many construction contracts in which the contractor provides an integration (or contract management) service to manage and co-ordinate the various construction tasks and to assume the risks associated with the integration of those tasks. Moreover, the integration service will require a contractor to co-ordinate the tasks performed by any subcontractors and ensure that those tasks are performed in accordance with the contract specifications, thus ensuring the individual goods or services are appropriately incorporated into the combined item for which the customer has contracted.</p></body></paragraph>
