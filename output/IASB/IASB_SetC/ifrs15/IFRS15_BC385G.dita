IAS 18 had a principle for this assessment (based on risks and rewards) that was different from the control principle in IFRS 15 and, although Topic 605 did not explicitly include a principle, the indicators in Topic 605 were understood to be indicators of risks and rewards. In addition, the structure of the analysis in <xref base="F52062249" href="IFRS15_gIE230-IE248F.dita#IFRS15_gIE230-IE248F/IFRS15_gIE230-IE248F_TI" id="IFRS15_X2113">Examples 45&#x2013;48</xref> accompanying IFRS 15 added to the confusion.</p></body></paragraph>
