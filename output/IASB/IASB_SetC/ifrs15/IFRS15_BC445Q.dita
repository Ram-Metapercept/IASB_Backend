This is because of the large number of contracts that would have to be evaluated in a relatively short time. Those entities highlighted that the benefit of the practical expedient would be considerably constrained if they cannot finalise the cumulative effect of past contract modifications ahead of the date of initial application of IFRS 15. The IASB observed that this decision creates a difference between IFRS 15 and Topic 606. However, an entity applying IFRS 15 in accordance with paragraph C3(b) could avoid the different reporting outcomes between IFRS 15 and Topic 606 by choosing to apply the practical expedient at the date of initial application.</p></body></paragraph>
