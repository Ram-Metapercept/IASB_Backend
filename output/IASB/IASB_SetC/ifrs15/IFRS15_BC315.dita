The boards decided that, in those situations, an entity should apply the requirements of other Standards (for example, IAS 2) for the following reasons:</p><ol id="IFRS15_L0202" base="F31840015" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2595" base="F31840016">if an entity incurs costs to fulfil a contract without also satisfying a performance obligation over time, the entity probably would be creating an asset included within the scope of other Standards (for example, the costs of producing tangible units would accumulate as inventory, and the entity would select an appropriate method of measuring that inventory). In those cases, the boards decided that an entity should not account for the learning curve differently depending on whether or not a contract exists.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2596" base="F31840018">the type of contract described in this paragraph is not the type of contract typically entered into by respondents who asked how the requirements of IFRS 15 would apply to learning curve effects (in most cases, those respondents enter into contracts that would be accounted for as a performance obligation satisfied over time).</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
