Disclosing those amounts provides relevant information about the timing of revenue recognition that was not a result of performance in the current period and thus provides useful information about the current period operating results and on predicting future revenues. In addition, the boards noted that this information is not provided elsewhere in the financial statements. Finally, the boards noted that, consistent with general materiality requirements, they did not expect this disclosure to be provided if the amounts are immaterial.</p></body></paragraph>
