A specific concern was raised about the boards&#x2019; decision (see <xref id="IFRS15_X1869" base="F51967234" href="IFRS15_BC90.dita#IFRS15_BC90">paragraph BC90</xref>) not to exempt an entity from accounting for performance obligations that the entity might regard as being perfunctory or inconsequential. Some stakeholders held the view that IFRS 15 might require an entity to identify significantly more performance obligations than would have been the case under previous revenue Standards.</p></body></paragraph>
