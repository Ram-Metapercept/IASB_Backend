However, the boards decided not to do this, primarily because they were concerned that doing so could have had the unintended consequence of an entity combining too many contracts and not faithfully depicting the entity&#x2019;s performance. Furthermore, the boards decided that an entity should apply judgement to determine whether a contract is entered into &#x2018;at or near the same time&#x2019;. However, the boards noted that the longer the period between the commitments of the parties to the contracts, the more likely it is that the economic circumstances affecting the negotiations have changed.</p></body></paragraph>
