On this basis, the IASB made clarifying amendments to IFRS 15 only when (a) it considered those amendments to be essential to clarifying the IASB&#x2019;s intentions when developing the requirements in IFRS 15; or (b) it viewed the benefits of retaining converged requirements as greater than any potential costs of amending the requirements.</p></body></paragraph>
