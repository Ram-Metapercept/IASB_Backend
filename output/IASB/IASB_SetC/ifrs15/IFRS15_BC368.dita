The warranty might be described as, for example, a manufacturer&#x2019;s warranty, a standard warranty or an extended warranty. The boards decided to provide specific requirements for applying the revenue recognition model to warranties, because many contracts with customers for the sale of products include a warranty and the nature of that warranty may vary across products, entities and jurisdictions.</p></body></paragraph>
