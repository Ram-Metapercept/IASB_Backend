Some respondents questioned whether oral and implied contracts could meet this criterion, especially if it is difficult to verify an entity&#x2019;s approval of that contract. The boards noted that the form of the contract does not, in and of itself, determine whether the parties have approved the contract. Instead, an entity should consider all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether the parties intend to be bound by the terms and conditions of the contract. Consequently, in some cases, the parties to an oral or an implied contract (in accordance with customary business practices) may have agreed to fulfil their respective obligations. In other cases, a written contract may be required to determine that the parties to the contract have approved it.</p></body></paragraph>
