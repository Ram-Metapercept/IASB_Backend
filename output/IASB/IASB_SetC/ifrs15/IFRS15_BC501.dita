However, the IASB rejected this proposal and, as explained in paragraph BC500, decided to require that an entity apply the measurement requirements in IFRS 15 to transfers of non-financial assets that are not an output of the entity&#x2019;s ordinary activities, for the following reasons:</p><ol base="F31852581" id="IFRS15_L0251" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p base="F31852582" id="IFRS15_P3044">measuring the gain on the transfers of non-financial assets that are not an output of the entity&#x2019;s ordinary activities by using the same requirements as for measuring revenue provides users of financial statements with useful information. The IASB decided that it would provide useful information if entities apply the requirements for constraining estimates of variable consideration to any gain that will be recognised on the transfer of the non-financial asset. The IASB acknowledged that in some cases this may result in a loss on the transfer when the transferred asset has a cost basis that is greater than the constrained consideration, which may occur when the asset has a cost basis that is determined using fair value. However, the IASB noted that this outcome is appropriate and useful to users, because of the significant uncertainty about the variable consideration. The IASB also noted that this outcome is consistent with the outcome in a transaction with a customer in which the variable consideration is constrained, but the entity has transferred control of the good or service to the customer.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p base="F31852584" id="IFRS15_P3045">it is not necessary to measure the gains on the transfers of non-financial assets to be consistent with other asset disposals, such as disposals of an entity, that are accounted for at fair value in accordance with other Standards (for example, <xref base="F35620195" href="../ifrs10/IFRS10_TOC.dita#IFRS10_TOC0001" id="IFRS15_X2301">IFRS 10</xref>).
