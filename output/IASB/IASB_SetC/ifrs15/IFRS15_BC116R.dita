Under previous revenue Standards, entities often did not account for shipping provided in conjunction with the sale of their goods as an additional service. As a result, some stakeholders raised cost&#x2011;benefit concerns and asked whether relief should be provided in respect of shipping and handling activities from the general requirement to assess the goods or services promised in a contract with a customer in order to identify performance obligations.</p></body></paragraph>
