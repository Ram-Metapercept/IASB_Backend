For instance, a customer may pay more for goods or services from an entity than it would otherwise have paid if it was not receiving a payment from the entity. Consequently, the boards decided that to depict revenue faithfully in those cases, any amount accounted for as a payment to the customer for goods or services received should be limited to the fair value of those goods or services, with any amount in excess of the fair value being recognised as a reduction of the transaction price.</p></body></paragraph>
