However, the boards noted that if a contract is not completed at the date of initial application, the entity would need to apply IFRS 15 to that entire contract to calculate any cumulative effect that would be recognised in the opening retained earnings in the year of initial application. The boards noted that the industries that would be most affected generally have contracts with durations that would result in those industries still having only a few months to prepare their processes and systems to capture the required information on a real-time basis.</p></body></paragraph>
