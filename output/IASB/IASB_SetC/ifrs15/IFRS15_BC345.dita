The boards observed that neither users of financial statements nor preparers supported the format proposed in the 2010 and the 2011 Exposure Drafts because users of financial statements were concerned that the information about the movements in the contract balances was too aggregated to be useful and because preparers were concerned about the cost of compliance with such a rigid format. The boards acknowledged that a previously rejected alternative format of a gross reconciliation of contract balances (ie to show the remaining contractual rights and performance obligations in separate columns) would have been inappropriate because it would not respond to preparers&#x2019; concerns about costs. This is because the cost of preparing and auditing the gross reconciliation would have been high, and possibly higher than the &#x2018;net&#x2019; reconciliation proposed in the 2011 Exposure Draft, because an entity would have been required to measure all unperformed contracts which would have required a high level of judgement.</p></body></paragraph>
