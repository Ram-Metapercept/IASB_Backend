The choice of the transition method will determine, for example, whether periods before the date of initial application of IFRS 15 are restated as well as the amount and date of the adjustment to retained earnings. Retrospective application of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Clarifications to IFRS 15</ph></ph> will affect only those reporting periods and those contracts to which IFRS 15 is applied. For example, consider an entity that applies IFRS 15 in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X2276" base="F52310692" href="IFRS15_C3.dita#IFRS15_C3">paragraph C3(b)</xref> on 1 January 2017 and <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Clarifications to IFRS 15</ph></ph> on 1 January 2018. Retrospective application of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Clarifications to IFRS 15</ph></ph> would not require the restatement of financial information before 1 January 2017 for the effects of the amendments. Any effect of applying the amendments would be included in a restated cumulative effect adjustment as of 1 January 2017.</p></body></paragraph>
