Those criteria are derived mainly from previous revenue recognition requirements and other existing standards. The boards decided that when some or all of those criteria are not met, it is questionable whether the contract establishes enforceable rights and obligations. The boards&#x2019; rationale for including those criteria is discussed in <xref id="IFRS15_X1749" base="F33215484" href="IFRS15_BC35.dita#IFRS15_BC35">paragraphs BC35&#x2013;BC46</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
