The effective date is set after consideration of information obtained in the exposure process about the time needed to implement the requirements. Accordingly, the IASB would consider changing the effective date only in exceptional circumstances. The IASB noted that it had already provided a considerable amount of time between issuing IFRS 15 and the effective date, anticipating that some entities would be required to change information technology systems and processes when applying the Standard. The IASB has also provided substantive relief on transition to IFRS 15 by giving entities a choice of transition methods, one of which does not involve the restatement of comparative financial information. In addition, the IASB observed that the proposed amendments noted in paragraph BC453A are expected to clarify, rather than change, the requirements of the Standard.</p></body></paragraph>
