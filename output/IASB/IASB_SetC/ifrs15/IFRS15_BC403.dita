In the examples they considered, the boards observed that licences vary significantly and include a wide array of different features and economic characteristics, which lead to significant differences in the rights provided by a licence. In some of the examples, the boards observed that the customer might be viewed as not obtaining control of the licence at a point in time. This is because the intellectual property to which the customer has obtained rights is dynamic and will change as a result of the entity&#x2019;s continuing involvement in its intellectual property, including activities that affect that intellectual property. In those cases, the customer may not be able to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the licence at the time of transfer. In other words, what the licence provides to the customer is access to the intellectual property in the form in which it exists at any given moment. (Those notions were supported by some respondents who opposed the proposal in the 2011 Exposure Draft that all distinct licences represent the transfer of a right to use an intangible asset.)</p></body></paragraph>
