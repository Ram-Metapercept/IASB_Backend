However, the boards decided that it would not be feasible to develop application guidance that would apply uniformly to various industries because the nature of the relationship (ie supplier-customer versus collaboration or partnership) would depend on specific terms and conditions in those contracts. The boards observed that in many arrangements highlighted by respondents, an entity would need to consider all relevant facts and circumstances, such as the purpose of the activities undertaken by the counterparty, to determine whether the counterparty is a customer. Examples of arrangements in which an entity would need to make that assessment are as follows:</p><ol id="IFRS15_L0163" base="F31827500" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2183" base="F31827543">collaborative research and development efforts between biotechnology and pharmaceutical entities or similar arrangements in the aerospace and defence, technology and healthcare industries or in higher education;</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2184" base="F31827545">arrangements in the oil and gas industry in which partners in an offshore oil and gas field may make payments to each other to settle any differences between their proportionate entitlements to production volumes from the field during a reporting period; and</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2185" base="F31827547">arrangements in the not-for-profit industry in which an entity receives grants and sponsorship for research activity and the grantor or sponsor may specify how any output from the research activity will be used.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
