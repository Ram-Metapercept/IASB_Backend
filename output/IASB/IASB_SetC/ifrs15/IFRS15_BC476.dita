In addition, the boards observed that the effects were a consequence of the boards&#x2019; objectives of eliminating industry&#x2011;specific requirements and defining a common framework that could be applied to all revenue transactions. Furthermore, the boards observed that the allocation requirements in IFRS 15 would result in accounting for a transaction in a manner that more closely reflects the underlying economics.</p></body></paragraph>
