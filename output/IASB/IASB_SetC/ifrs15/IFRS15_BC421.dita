Although the boards acknowledge that the requirements in <xref id="IFRS15_X2204" base="F35620000" href="IFRS15_gB63-B63B.dita#IFRS15_gB63-B63B">paragraph B63 of IFRS 15</xref> constitute an exception that might not be consistent with the principle of recognising some or all of the estimate of variable consideration, they decided that this disadvantage was outweighed by the simplicity of these requirements, as well as by the relevance of the resulting information for this type of transaction. The boards also noted that because this is a specific requirement intended for only limited circumstances, entities should not apply it by analogy to other types of promised goods or services or other types of variable consideration.</p></body></paragraph>
