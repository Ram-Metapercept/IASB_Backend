In this case, if the customisation service requires the entity to significantly modify the existing software in such a way that the risks of providing the software and the customisation service are inseparable, the entity may conclude that the promises to transfer the software and the customisation service would not be separately identifiable and, therefore, those goods or services would not be distinct within the context of the contract.</p></body></paragraph>
