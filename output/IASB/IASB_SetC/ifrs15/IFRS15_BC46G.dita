This amendment is expected to allow an entity to recognise any consideration received as revenue when (a) the entity has transferred control of the goods or services to which the consideration received relates; (b) the entity has stopped transferring additional goods or services and has no obligation to transfer additional goods or services; and (c) the consideration received from the customer is non-refundable.</p></body></paragraph>
