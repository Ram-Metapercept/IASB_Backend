As described in <xref id="IFRS15_X1870" base="F52069714" href="IFRS15_BC84.dita#IFRS15_BC84">paragraph BC84</xref>, the boards intended the notion of a performance obligation to be similar to the notions of deliverables, components or elements of a contract in previous revenue Standards. The IASB noted that IFRS 15 requires an entity to identify performance obligations rather than promised goods or services. Accordingly, although an entity makes an assessment of the goods or services promised in a contract in order to identify material performance obligations, the boards did not intend to require an entity to individually identify every possible promised good or service.</p></body></paragraph>
