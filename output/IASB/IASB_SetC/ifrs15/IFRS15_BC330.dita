In the boards&#x2019; view, a clear objective improves the interpretation and implementation of the disclosure requirements. This is because a preparer can assess whether the overall quality and informational value of its revenue disclosures are sufficient to meet the stated objectives. The boards also observed that specifying an overall disclosure objective avoids the need for detailed and prescriptive disclosure requirements to accommodate the many and varied types of contracts with customers that are within the scope of IFRS 15.</p></body></paragraph>
