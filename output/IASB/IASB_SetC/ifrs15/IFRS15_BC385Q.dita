If individual goods or services are not distinct from each other, then they may be, for example, merely inputs to a combined item and are each only part of a single promise to the customer. Accordingly, an entity should evaluate the nature of its promise (ie to act as a principal or an agent) within the context of the promise to the customer, rather than for part of that promise. Consequently, for contracts in which goods or services provided by another party are inputs to a combined item (or items) for which the customer has contracted, the entity assesses whether it controls the combined item before that item is transferred to the customer.</p></body></paragraph>
