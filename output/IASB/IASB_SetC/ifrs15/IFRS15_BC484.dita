Specifically, the information about revenue would enable users of financial statements to better understand an entity&#x2019;s contracts with customers and revenue from those contracts and to better predict cash flows. This information should also help users of financial statements to make more informed economic decisions. The boards acknowledged that these improvements may increase the costs of the application of IFRS 15 for preparers. However, the boards concluded that these costs were necessary to improve the usefulness of financial reporting in an area that is critical for users of financial statements to the analysis and understanding of an entity&#x2019;s performance and prospects.</p></body></paragraph>
