Furthermore, the boards observed that segment information might be based on non-GAAP information (ie the revenue that is reported to the chief operating decision maker may be recognised and measured on a basis that is not in accordance with IFRS 15). The boards also observed that the objective of providing segment information in accordance with <xref base="F35619724" href="../ifrs08/IFRS08_TOC.dita#IFRS08_TOC0001" id="IFRS15_X2061">IFRS 8</xref> or Topic 280 is different from the objective for the disaggregation disclosure in IFRS 15 and, therefore, segment revenue disclosures may not always provide users of financial statements with enough information to help them understand the composition of revenue recognised in the period. Nonetheless, the boards clarified in <xref base="F35619725" href="IFRS15_112.dita#IFRS15_112" id="IFRS15_X2062">paragraph 112 of IFRS 15</xref> that an entity does not need to provide disaggregated revenue disclosures if the information about revenue provided in accordance with <xref base="F35619726" href="../ifrs08/IFRS08_TOC.dita#IFRS08_TOC0001" id="IFRS15_X2063">IFRS 8</xref> or Topic 280 meets the requirements specified in <xref base="F35619727" href="IFRS15_114.dita#IFRS15_114" id="IFRS15_X2064">paragraph 114 of IFRS 15</xref> and those revenue disclosures are based on the recognition and measurement requirements in IFRS 15.</p></body></paragraph>
