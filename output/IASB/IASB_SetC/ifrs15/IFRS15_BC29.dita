The boards decided that they will consider the definition of revenue when they revise their respective conceptual frameworks. However, the IASB decided to carry forward into IFRS 15 the description of revenue from the IASB&#x2019;s <xref href="../cf2018/CF2018_TOC0001.dita" scope="local" id="IFRS15_X1744"><i>Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting</i></xref><xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS15_FN0015" type="fn"/> rather than the definition of revenue from a previous revenue Standard. The IASB noted that the definition in a previous revenue Standard referred to &#x2018;gross inflow of economic benefits&#x2019; and it had concerns that some might have misread that reference as implying that an entity should recognise as revenue a prepayment from a customer for goods or services. As described in <xref base="F75020224" href="IFRS15_BC17.dita#IFRS15_BC17" id="IFRS15_X1745">paragraphs BC17&#x2013;BC24</xref>, the principle is that revenue is recognised in accordance with IFRS 15 as a result of an entity satisfying a performance obligation in a contract with a customer. In addition, the FASB decided to carry forward a definition of revenue that is based on the definition in FASB Concepts Statement No. 6 <i>Elements of Financial Statements</i>.</p>     </variant></body></paragraph>
