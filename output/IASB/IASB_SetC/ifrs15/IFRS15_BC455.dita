The evaluation of these effects is necessarily subjective and qualitative. This is because quantifying costs and, particularly, benefits, is inherently difficult. Although other standard-setters undertake similar types of analyses, there is a lack of sufficiently well-established and reliable techniques for quantifying this analysis. Consequently, the IASB sees this analysis of the effects as being part of an evolving process. In addition, the assessment undertaken is that of the likely effects of the new requirements because the actual effects would not be known until after the new requirements had been applied. These are subsequently analysed through the Post-implementation Review process.</p></body></paragraph>
