This is because users of financial statements are likely to view those arrangements as licensing arrangements. The boards had previously observed in <xref id="IFRS15_X2209" base="F52283018" href="IFRS15_BC415.dita#IFRS15_BC415">paragraph BC415</xref> that it would not be useful for an entity to recognise a minimum amount of revenue for licences of intellectual property for which the consideration is based on the customer&#x2019;s sales or usage. Applying the royalties constraint only when the royalty relates solely to a licence that is distinct in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X2210" base="F52283019" href="IFRS15_27.dita#IFRS15_27/IFRS15_27_V2">paragraph 27 of IFRS 15</xref> might unduly restrict its application.</p></body></paragraph>
