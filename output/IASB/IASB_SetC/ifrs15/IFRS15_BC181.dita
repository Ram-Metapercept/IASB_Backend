Using that approach, an entity allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation at an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation. That allocation determines the amount of revenue that an entity recognises when (or as) it satisfies each performance obligation. Most respondents supported the allocated transaction price approach.</p></body></paragraph>
