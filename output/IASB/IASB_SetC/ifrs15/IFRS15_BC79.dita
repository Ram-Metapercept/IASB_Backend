Those contracts typically include repetitive services, such as energy contracts or mobile phone airtime services. The boards considered those concerns and clarified in <xref id="IFRS15_X1825" base="F51967233" href="IFRS15_21.dita#IFRS15_21">paragraph 21(a) of IFRS 15</xref> that the determination of whether a modification is accounted for prospectively depends on whether the remaining promises in the contract are for distinct goods or services. This is the case even if an entity determines that it has a single performance obligation, provided that the performance obligation represents a series of distinct goods or services (see <xref id="IFRS15_X1826" base="F35363156" href="IFRS15_gBC113-BC116.dita#IFRS15_gBC113-BC116/IFRS15_gBC113-BC116_TI">paragraphs BC113&#x2013;BC116</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
