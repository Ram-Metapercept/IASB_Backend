In particular, the IASB concluded that an example relating to whether an anti-virus software licence is distinct from when&#x2011;and&#x2011;if&#x2011;available updates to the software during the licence period (Example 10, Case C in Topic 606) was unnecessary. The IASB thought that this additional example was not required because <xref id="IFRS15_X1888" base="F51967618" href="IFRS15_gIE278-IE280.dita#IFRS15_gIE278-IE280/IFRS15_gIE278-IE280_TI">Example 55</xref> that accompanies IFRS 15 illustrates the application of the requirements on identifying performance obligations to a similar fact pattern.</p></body></paragraph>
