That method requires an entity (that is not a first-time adopter of IFRS) to apply IFRS 15 retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 15 recognised in the current year (referred to as the &#x2018;cumulative catch-up&#x2019; transition method). Using the cumulative catch-up transition method, an entity would apply the requirements retrospectively only to contracts that are not completed at the beginning of the date of initial application (which, if applied to a first&#x2011;time adopter would be the entity&#x2019;s first IFRS reporting period).</p></body></paragraph>
