However, because the most useful disaggregation of revenue depends on various entity-specific or industry-specific factors, the boards decided that IFRS 15 should not prescribe any specific factor to be used as the basis for disaggregating revenue from contracts with customers. Instead, the boards decided to specify in <xref id="IFRS15_X2056" base="F35619689" href="IFRS15_114.dita#IFRS15_114">paragraph 114 of IFRS 15</xref> an objective for providing disaggregated information. The boards noted that specifying an objective will result in the most useful information for users of financial statements, because it enables an entity to disaggregate revenue into categories that are meaningful for its business. In addition, specifying an objective should result in disaggregation that is neither too aggregated nor too detailed.</p></body></paragraph>
