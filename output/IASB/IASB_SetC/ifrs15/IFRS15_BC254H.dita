The IASB also noted the view of some TRG members that in practice it might be difficult to distinguish between variability in the fair value due to the form of the consideration and other reasons, in which case applying the variable consideration constraint to the whole of the estimate of the non-cash consideration might be more practical. However, for reasons similar to those discussed in <xref id="IFRS15_X2000" base="F52062161" href="IFRS15_BC254E.dita#IFRS15_BC254E">paragraph BC254E</xref>, the IASB decided not to amend IFRS 15 for this issue. Consequently, the IASB acknowledged that differences may arise between an entity reporting under IFRS and an entity reporting under US GAAP.</p></body></paragraph>
