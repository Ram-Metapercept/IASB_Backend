This is because it would eliminate comparability within a first-time adopter&#x2019;s first IFRS financial statements by providing relief from restating comparative years. The IASB also observed that the cumulative catch-up transition method may not reduce the burden of retrospective application because it would potentially require two separate reconciliations of equity&#x2014;one for the transition to IFRS, which would be recognised in the earliest comparative period, and one for the transition to IFRS 15, which would be recognised at the beginning of the entity&#x2019;s first IFRS reporting period. This would not only be challenging for preparers, but might also be confusing for users of financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
