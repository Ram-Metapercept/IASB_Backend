However, those disclosures should not be viewed as a checklist of minimum disclosures, because some disclosures may be relevant for some entities or industries but may be irrelevant for others. The boards also observed that it is important for an entity to consider the disclosures together with the disclosure objective and materiality. Consequently, <xref id="IFRS15_X2052" base="F35619685" href="IFRS15_111.dita#IFRS15_111">paragraph 111 of IFRS 15</xref> clarifies that an entity need not disclose information that is immaterial.</p></body></paragraph>
