The boards observed that a careful consideration of the facts and circumstances, and exercise of judgement may be required in identifying the specified good or service (just as identifying an entity&#x2019;s performance obligations outside the context of a principal versus agent evaluation will often require judgement). The boards also observed that assessing whether an entity controls a right to a good or service to be provided by another party is important to the principal versus agent evaluation. The boards noted that the Illustrative Examples accompanying IFRS 15 on principal versus agent considerations have been designed to address and explain scenarios in which the specified good or service is a right to a good or service to be provided by another party (as in Example 47 accompanying IFRS 15) and scenarios in which the specified good or service is the underlying service itself (as in <xref base="F52062342" href="IFRS15_gIE238A-IE238G.dita#IFRS15_gIE238A-IE238G_V1/IFRS15_gIE238A-IE238G_TI_V1" id="IFRS15_X2129">Example 46A</xref> accompanying IFRS 15).</p></body></paragraph>
