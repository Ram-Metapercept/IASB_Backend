The main concerns raised by those respondents were as follows:</p><ol id="IFRS15_L0229" base="F31840433" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2854" base="F31840434">it may not be possible to obtain historical information for contracts that were completed under previous revenue Standards in IFRS or US GAAP because the relevant information is no longer retained by the entity.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2855" base="F31840436">applying IFRS 15 retrospectively (particularly to completed contracts) may not result in a materially different pattern of revenue recognition, and the significant costs incurred to confirm this fact would not provide much benefit to users of financial statements. For example, for contracts that were considered to be completed (as assessed under previous revenue Standards) several years before the date of initial application, an entity would, theoretically, need to obtain the relevant information to ensure that there was no effect on the pattern of revenue recognition in the financial statements in the year of initial application.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2856" base="F31840448">presenting the effect of IFRS 15 in the comparative years would incur significant preparation and audit costs, because a change in revenue could affect many other line items in the financial statements (such as deferred tax, receivables, interest and foreign currency gains/losses) as well as items that reference an entity&#x2019;s revenue in the financial statements (such as taxes, statutory reporting and financing arrangements).</p></li><li><li_value>(d)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2857" base="F31840450">the historical information needed to estimate stand-alone selling prices of goods or services in a contract with many performance obligations may not exist.</p></li><li><li_value>(e)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2858" base="F31840452">entities make assumptions and estimates throughout a contract&#x2019;s life, and it may not be possible to recreate the circumstances that apply historically without the use of hindsight.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
