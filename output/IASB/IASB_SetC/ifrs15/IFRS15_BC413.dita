As a criterion for differentiating licences, this would have resulted in <i>all</i> of the promised consideration being recognised over time for such licences, including any fixed amount. The boards decided not to include royalties as a criterion for differentiating licences, because the existence of a sales-based or a usage-based royalty does not solely define performance over time. However, the boards observed that, in some cases, the existence of a sales-based or a usage-based royalty can indicate a &#x2018;shared economic interest&#x2019; between the entity and the customer in the intellectual property being licensed and therefore the customer could reasonably expect that the entity will undertake activities that affect the intellectual property to which the licence relates. The boards also decided, however, to include an exception for the revenue recognition pattern of sales-based or usage-based royalties (see <xref id="IFRS15_X2168" base="F35619964" href="IFRS15_gBC415-BC421J.dita#IFRS15_gBC415-BC421J">paragraphs BC415&#x2013;BC421</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
