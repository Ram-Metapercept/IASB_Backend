The objective of those workshops was to discuss issues on disclosure and transition and to identify potential solutions to address both users&#x2019; needs for useful information and preparers&#x2019; concerns about the costs of providing that information. As a result of the feedback provided through workshops, other outreach efforts and the comment letters, the boards refined the disclosure requirements proposed in the 2011 Exposure Draft. Those refinements and the reasons for the boards&#x2019; decisions are explained in <xref id="IFRS15_X2049" base="F35619682" href="IFRS15_BC330.dita#IFRS15_BC330">paragraphs BC330&#x2013;BC361</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
