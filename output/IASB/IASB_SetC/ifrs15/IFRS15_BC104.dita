In addition, for some goods or services, especially software and other types of intellectual property, cost is not a significant factor in determining price and, therefore, margins could be highly variable because they may be determined by the customer&#x2019;s ability to pay or to obtain substitute goods or services from another entity.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2258" base="F31831608">criteria based on the notions of goods or services that are significantly modified or customised, and highly interrelated goods or services that require an entity to provide a significant service of integrating those goods or services&#x2014;respondents explained that while these are relevant factors to consider to determine whether a good or service is distinct, expressing those factors as criteria could be too restrictive because they could force bundling or unbundling that did not reflect the economics of the arrangement.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
