The IASB decided (a) to expand the application of the transition method described in <xref id="IFRS15_X2249" base="F52283093" href="IFRS15_C3.dita#IFRS15_C3">paragraph C3(b)</xref> by allowing an entity a choice to apply IFRS 15 to all contracts including completed contracts; and (b) to provide transition relief for contract modifications. The FASB decided to make similar amendments to Topic 606. The IASB additionally decided to allow an entity using the transition method described in <xref id="IFRS15_X2250" base="F52310688" href="IFRS15_C3.dita#IFRS15_C3">paragraph C3(a)</xref> not to restate completed contracts at the beginning of the earliest period presented. The following paragraphs explain the boards&#x2019; considerations in providing the additional practical expedients.</p></body></paragraph>
