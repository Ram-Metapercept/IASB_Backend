The IASB observed that IFRS 1 requires that the accounting policies effective at the end of the first IFRS reporting period are applied to all reporting periods from the date of transition to IFRS onwards. This is identical to retrospective application for entities already applying IFRS. Some IASB members also noted that in many jurisdictions that have not yet adopted IFRS, revenue standards are similar to current IFRS. In those jurisdictions, the starting point for transition for a first-time adopter will be similar to entities already applying IFRS.</p></body></paragraph>
