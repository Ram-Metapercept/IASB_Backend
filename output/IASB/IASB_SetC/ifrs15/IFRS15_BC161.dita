An entity should not use different methods to measure its performance in satisfying the same or similar performance obligations, otherwise that entity&#x2019;s revenue would not be comparable in different reporting periods. The boards also noted that if an entity were permitted to apply more than one method to measure its performance in fulfilling a performance obligation, it would effectively bypass the requirements for identifying performance obligations.</p></body></paragraph>
