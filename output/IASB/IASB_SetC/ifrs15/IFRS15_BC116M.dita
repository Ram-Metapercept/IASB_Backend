This concept is illustrated by the example in <xref id="IFRS15_X1883" base="F51967613" href="IFRS15_BC112.dita#IFRS15_BC112">paragraph BC112</xref>, in which an entity agrees to design an experimental product for a customer and to manufacture 10 prototype units of that product. In the example, the design and production of the units is an iterative process and the significant integration service provided by the entity relates to all 10 prototype units.</p></body></paragraph>
