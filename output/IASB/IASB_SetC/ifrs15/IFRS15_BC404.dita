The boards noted that these criteria were necessary to distinguish between the two types of licences, rather than strictly relying on the control requirements, because it is difficult to assess when the customer obtains control of assets in a licence without first identifying the nature of the entity&#x2019;s performance obligation.</p></body></paragraph>
