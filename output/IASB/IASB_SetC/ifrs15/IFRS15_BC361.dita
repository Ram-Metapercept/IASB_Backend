The FASB noted that it is helpful to provide entities with certainty about the information that should be provided in interim financial reports. In addition, the FASB observed that an entity would be compiling most of the information required for the disclosures on an interim basis for the purposes of revenue recognition, and therefore disclosing that information might not result in a significant amount of incremental costs. The FASB also observed that this information is useful to users of financial statements in assessing an entity&#x2019;s current and future financial performance.</p></body></paragraph>
