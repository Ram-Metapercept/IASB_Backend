The boards included the indicator &#x2018;the customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset&#x2019; because of comments from respondents who disagreed with the boards&#x2019; initial proposal to eliminate considerations of the &#x2018;risks and rewards of ownership&#x2019; from the recognition of revenue. Respondents observed that risks and rewards can be a helpful factor to consider when determining the transfer of control, as highlighted by the IASB in <xref base="F35619239" href="../ifrs10/IFRS10_TOC.dita#IFRS10_TOC0001" id="IFRS15_X1917">IFRS 10 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Consolidated Financial Statements</ph></ph></xref>, and can often be a consequence of controlling an asset.
