This assessment forms part of Step 1 of IFRS 15 <i>Identify the contract(s) with a customer</i>. The TRG&#x2019;s discussions informed the boards that some stakeholders interpreted this requirement to mean that an entity should assess the probability of collecting all of the consideration promised in the contract. Under this interpretation, some contracts with customers that are assessed as having poor credit quality would not meet the criteria in paragraph 9(e), even though they are otherwise valid contracts. Other stakeholders asserted that those contracts would be valid if the entity has the ability to protect itself from credit risk.</p></body></paragraph>
