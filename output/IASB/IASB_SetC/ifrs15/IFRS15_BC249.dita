That approach is consistent both with requirements in previous revenue Standards in IFRS and with requirements for other situations in which the fair value of the assets surrendered in exchange for assets received may be estimated more reliably. (For instance, <xref base="F35619486" href="../ifrs02/IFRS02_TOC.dita#IFRS02_TOC0001" id="IFRS15_X1990">IFRS 2 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Share-based Payment</ph></ph></xref> and Subtopic 505&#x2011;50 <i>Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees</i> state that if the fair value of the goods or services received cannot be estimated reliably, then the entity measures them indirectly by reference to the fair value of the granted equity instrument.)</p></body></paragraph>
