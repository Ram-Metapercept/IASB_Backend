The boards noted that an entity should use judgement and consider all relevant facts and circumstances in making that determination. The boards observed that this judgement was being applied under previous revenue recognition requirements. Consequently, the boards decided not to develop detailed requirements for differentiating between a price concession and impairment losses.</p></body></paragraph>
