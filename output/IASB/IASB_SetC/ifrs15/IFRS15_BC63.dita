Those respondents stated that some of the requirements for accounting for contract assets (which would meet the definition of a financial asset) are inconsistent with the requirements in financial instruments Standards for accounting for financial assets. For example, in some cases a contract asset is not required to be adjusted for the time value of money (see <xref base="F33215708" href="IFRS15_BC236.dita#IFRS15_BC236" id="IFRS15_X1802">paragraph BC236</xref>), and in other cases the contract asset might initially be measured at an amount that excludes some of the expected cash flows if the transaction price includes variable consideration (see <xref base="F33215709" href="IFRS15_BC189.dita#IFRS15_BC189" id="IFRS15_X1803">paragraphs BC189&#x2013;BC223</xref>). However, the IASB disagreed with those respondents. The IASB noted that the requirements in paragraph 5 of IFRS 15 (together with <xref base="F35619146" href="../ias39/IAS39_2.dita#IAS39_2/IAS39_2_V3" id="IFRS15_X1804">paragraph 2(k) of IAS 39 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement</ph></ph></xref>, which is a consequential amendment to IAS 39 added by IFRS 15) are clear that when a contract asset is within the scope of IFRS 15, it is not within the scope of IFRS 9.</p></body></paragraph>
