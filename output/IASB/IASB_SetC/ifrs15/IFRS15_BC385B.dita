These amendments focus on (a) the need for appropriately identifying the good or service that is transferred to the customer (the &#x2018;specified good or service&#x2019;); and (b) determining whether the entity has promised to provide the specified good or service itself (ie the entity is a principal) or to arrange for the specified good or service to be provided to the customer by the other party (ie the entity is an agent). The entity determines the nature of its promise on the basis of whether the entity controls the specified good or service before that good or service is transferred to the customer. Throughout the guidance on principal versus agent considerations, the boards decided to refer to the <i>specified good or service</i> transferred to the customer (as in <xref id="IFRS15_X2105" base="F52062201" href="IFRS15_B34.dita#IFRS15_B34/IFRS15_B34_V2">paragraph B34</xref>), rather than the <i>performance obligation</i>. This is because use of the term &#x2018;performance obligation&#x2019; would have been confusing if the entity is an agent. An agent&#x2019;s performance obligation is to arrange for the other party to provide its goods or services to the customer; it does not promise to provide the goods or services itself to the end customer. Accordingly, the specified good or service to be provided to the end customer is not the performance obligation of the agent.</p></body></paragraph>
