However, by including those contracts within the scope of IFRS 15, an entity would provide additional information about a change in its financial position that resulted from entering into those contracts, that is, disclosing the amount of transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations in that wholly unperformed contract (see <xref id="IFRS15_X1792" base="F33215633" href="IFRS15_120.dita#IFRS15_120">paragraph 120 of IFRS 15</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
