For that reason, the boards included indicators in <xref id="IFRS15_X2101" base="F35619882" href="IFRS15_B37.dita#IFRS15_B37">paragraph B37 of IFRS 15</xref> to help an entity determine whether the entity controls the goods or services before transferring them and thus whether the entity is a principal or an agent. Those indicators are based on indicators that were included in previous revenue recognition requirements in IFRS and US GAAP. However, as noted in <xref id="IFRS15_X2102" base="F35619883" href="IFRS15_BC380.dita#IFRS15_BC380">paragraph BC380</xref>, the indicators in IFRS 15 have a different purpose than previous revenue recognition requirements in that they are based on the concepts of identifying performance obligations and the transfer of control of goods or services.</p></body></paragraph>
