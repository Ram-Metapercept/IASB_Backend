In addition, the boards observed that a common revenue Standard should make the financial reporting of revenue comparable between entities that prepare financial statements in accordance with IFRS or US GAAP, resulting in a significant benefit to users. Furthermore, by providing a rationale for the requirements (ie a Basis for Conclusions), the framework should be more easily applied to a broad range of transactions and contracts.</p></body></paragraph>
