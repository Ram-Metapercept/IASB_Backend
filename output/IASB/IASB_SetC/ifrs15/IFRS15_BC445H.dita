The FASB believes that the objective of the transition guidance in Topic 606 should be to ensure that all (or substantially all) of the revenue from contracts with customers that is recognised after transition to Topic 606 should be recognised in accordance with Topic 606. Accordingly, the FASB decided to amend the definition of a completed contract so that an entity would apply Topic 606 to all contracts for which all (or substantially all) of the revenue was not recognised under the previous revenue Standards. The FASB acknowledged that an entity would need to apply judgement in some cases to determine whether a contract is completed.</p></body></paragraph>
