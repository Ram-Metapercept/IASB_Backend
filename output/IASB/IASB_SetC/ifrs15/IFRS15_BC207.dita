This is because the boards&#x2019; decision introduces a downward bias into estimates that will be included in the transaction price. However, the boards decided that this bias was reasonable because users of financial statements indicated that revenue is more relevant if it is not expected to be subject to significant future reversals.</p></body></paragraph>
