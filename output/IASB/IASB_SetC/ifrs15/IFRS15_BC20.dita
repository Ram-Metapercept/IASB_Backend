That transfer results in revenue recognition, because upon satisfying a performance obligation an entity no longer has that obligation to provide the good or service. Consequently, its position in the contract increases&#x2014;either its contract asset increases or its contract liability decreases&#x2014;and that increase leads to revenue recognition.</p></body></paragraph>
