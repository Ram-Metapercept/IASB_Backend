Those entities are likely to wish to avoid reporting changes to revenue when first implementing the Standard and then, within a year or two, potentially reporting further changes to revenue as a result of applying any amendments to the Standard. For those entities, a deferral of the effective date by one year would provide additional time to implement any amendments to the Standard.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2953" base="SL47210166">IFRS 15 was issued later than had been anticipated when the IASB set the effective date of the Standard, which absorbed some of the implementation time that entities were expecting to have.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2954" base="SL47210168">IFRS 15 is a converged Standard with Topic 606&#x2014;although this was not the only consideration, the IASB observed that there are benefits for a broad range of stakeholders of retaining an effective date that is aligned with the effective date of Topic 606.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
