Consequently, revenue could be recognised when the seller surrenders control of a good or service or when the customer obtains control of that good or service. Although in many cases both perspectives lead to the same result, the boards decided that control should be assessed primarily from the perspective of the customer. That perspective minimises the risk of an entity recognising revenue from undertaking activities that do not coincide with the transfer of goods or services to the customer.</p></body></paragraph>
