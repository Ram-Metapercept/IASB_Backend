That exemption is broader than in IFRS 6 because IFRS 4 leaves many significant aspects of accounting for insurance contracts until phase II of the Board&#x2019;s project on that topic. A requirement to apply <xref base="F15831514" href="../ias08/IAS08_10.dita#IAS08_10" id="IFRS06_X0161">paragraph 10 of IAS 8</xref> to insurance contracts would have had much more pervasive effects and insurers would have needed to address matters such as completeness, substance over form and neutrality. In contrast, IFRS 6 leaves a relatively narrow range of issues unaddressed and the Board did not think that an exemption from paragraph 10 of IAS 8 was necessary.</p></body></paragraph>
