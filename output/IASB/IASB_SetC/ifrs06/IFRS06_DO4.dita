Although a research project has begun, it is unlikely that the Board will be able to develop financial reporting standards in the medium term. Accordingly, it is likely that the concession referred to in <xref id="IFRS06_X0250" base="F15831412" href="IFRS06_DO2.dita#IFRS06_DO2">paragraph DO2</xref> and, in Messrs Garnett and McGregor&#x2019;s cases, in <xref id="IFRS06_X0251" base="F15831411" href="IFRS06_DO3.dita#IFRS06_DO3">paragraph DO3</xref>, will remain in place for some time.</p></body></paragraph>
