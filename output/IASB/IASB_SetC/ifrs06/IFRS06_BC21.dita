Consistently with its conclusions in <ph>IFRS 4</ph>, the Board concluded that defining national GAAP would have posed problems. Further definitional problems could have arisen because some entities do not apply the national GAAP of their own country. For example, some non&#x2011;US entities with extractive activities in the oil and gas sector apply US GAAP. Moreover, it is unusual and, arguably, beyond the Board&#x2019;s mandate to impose requirements set by another body.</p></body></paragraph>
