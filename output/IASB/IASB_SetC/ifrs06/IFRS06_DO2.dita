In particular, they believe that all entities should be required to apply <xref base="F74981072" href="../ias08/IAS08_11.dita#IAS08_11" id="IFRS06_X0245">paragraphs 11 and 12 of IAS 8 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors</ph></ph></xref> when developing an accounting policy for exploration and evaluation assets. These Board members believe that the requirements in <xref base="F74981074" href="../ias08/IAS08_TOC.dita#IAS08_TOC0001" id="IFRS06_X0246">IAS 8</xref> have particular relevance and applicability when an IFRS lacks specificities, as is the case for entities recognising exploration and evaluation assets. This is especially true because the IFRS allows the continuation of a variety of measurement bases for these items and, because of the failure to consider the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph>,<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS06_FN0010" type="fn"/> may result in the inappropriate recognition of assets. In the view of these Board members, if an entity cannot meet those requirements, it should not be allowed to describe its financial statements as being in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
