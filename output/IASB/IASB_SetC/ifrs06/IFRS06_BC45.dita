They also supported the notion that entities should test impairment at the level of the cost centre and suggested that the Board should consider defining an &#x2018;asset&#x2019; as it applied to exploration and evaluation assets. The respondents argued that such an approach would reflect more accurately the way in which the industry manages its operations.
