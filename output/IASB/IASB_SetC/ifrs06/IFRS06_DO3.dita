They think that the requirements of <xref id="IFRS06_X0249" base="F15831719" href="../ias36/IAS36_TOC0001.dita#IAS36_TOC0001">IAS 36</xref> should be applied in their entirety to exploration and evaluation assets. Failure to do so could result in exploration and evaluation assets continuing to be carried forward when such assets are not known to be recoverable. This could result in the exclusion of relevant information from the financial statements because of the failure to recognise impairment losses on a timely basis and the inclusion of unreliable information because of the inclusion of assets that do not faithfully represent the transactions and other events that they purport to represent.</p></body></paragraph>
