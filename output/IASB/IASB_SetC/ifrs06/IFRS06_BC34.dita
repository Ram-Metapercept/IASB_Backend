However, the Board concluded that an entity should classify the elements of exploration and evaluation assets as tangible or intangible according to their nature and apply this classification consistently. This classification is the foundation for other accounting policy choices as described in <xref id="IFRS06_X0196" base="F15832146" href="IFRS06_gBC29-BC31.dita#IFRS06_gBC29-BC31">paragraphs BC29&#x2013;BC31</xref> and for the disclosures required by the IFRS.</p></body></paragraph>
