Without this consistency, there was a danger that expenditures that would form part of the cost of an exploration and evaluation asset under one of the common methods of accounting for the exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources would need to be recognised in profit or loss in accordance with <xref id="IFRS06_X0205" base="F15831764" href="../ias36/IAS36_TOC0001.dita#IAS36_TOC0001">IAS 36</xref>. Consequently, ED 6 proposed that an entity recognising exploration and evaluation assets should make a one&#x2011;time election to test those assets either at the level of the <xref id="IFRS06_X0206" base="F15831798" href="../ias36/IAS36_TOC0001.dita#IAS36_TOC0001">IAS 36</xref> cash&#x2011;generating unit (CGU) or at the level of a special CGU. ED 6 explained that any assets other than exploration and evaluation assets included within the special CGU should continue to be subject to separate impairment testing in accordance with <xref id="IFRS06_X0207" base="F15831758" href="../ias36/IAS36_TOC0001.dita#IAS36_TOC0001">IAS 36</xref>, and that impairment test should be performed before the special CGU was tested for impairment.</p></body></paragraph>
