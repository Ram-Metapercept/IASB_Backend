Both activities can be costly and have significant risks of failure. These respondents would support bringing the exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources within the scope of <xref base="F15832081" href="../ias16/IAS16_TOC.dita#IAS16_TOC0001" id="IFRS06_X0166">IAS 16</xref> and <xref base="F15832082" href="../ias38/IAS38_TOC0001.dita#IAS38_TOC0001" id="IFRS06_X0167">IAS 38</xref>. The Board is similarly concerned that existing accounting practices might result in the inappropriate recognition of exploration and evaluation assets. However, it is also concerned that accounting for exploration and evaluation expenditures in accordance with <xref base="F15832083" href="../ias38/IAS38_TOC0001.dita#IAS38_TOC0001" id="IFRS06_X0168">IAS 38</xref> might result in the overstatement of expenses. In the absence of internationally accepted standards for such expenditures, the Board concluded that it could not make an informed judgement in advance of the comprehensive review of accounting for extractive activities.</p></body></paragraph>
