In addition, <xref id="IFRS06_X0210" base="F15831801" href="../ias36/IAS36_70.dita#IAS36_70">paragraph 70 of IAS 36</xref> requires that &#x2018;if an active market exists for the output produced by an asset or group of assets, that asset or group of assets shall be identified as a cash&#x2011;generating unit&#x2019;. In some cases in which exploration and evaluation assets are recognised, eg in the petroleum sector, each well is potentially capable of producing cash inflows that are observable and capable of reliable measurement because there is an active market for crude oil. The Board was concerned that removing the special CGU would cause entities recognising exploration and evaluation assets to test for impairment at a very low level.</p></body></paragraph>
