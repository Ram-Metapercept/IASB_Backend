Therefore, pending completion of the comprehensive review of accounting for extractive activities, the Board decided to change the approach to recognition of impairment; the assessment of impairment should be triggered by changes in facts and circumstances. However, it also confirmed that, once an entity had determined that an exploration and evaluation asset was impaired, <xref id="IFRS06_X0200" base="F15831761" href="../ias36/IAS36_TOC0001.dita#IAS36_TOC0001">IAS 36</xref> should be used to measure, present and disclose that impairment in the financial statements, subject to special requirements with respect to the level at which impairment is assessed.</p></body></paragraph>
