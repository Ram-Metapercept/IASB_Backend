However, it was apparent from some comments received that the Board&#x2019;s intention had not been understood clearly. Consequently, the IFRS contains a specific statement that complying with <xref id="IFRS06_X0165" base="F15831512" href="../ias08/IAS08_10.dita#IAS08_10">paragraph 10 of IAS 8</xref> is mandatory.</p></body></paragraph>
