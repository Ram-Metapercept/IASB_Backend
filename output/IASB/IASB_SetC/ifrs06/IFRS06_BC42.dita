This suggested that it was not needed. Paragraph BC20 of the Basis for Conclusions on ED 6 noted the Board&#x2019;s reluctance to introduce a special CGU. Removing the special CGU would eliminate much of the complexity in the proposed IFRS and the confusion among constituents. It would also mean that entities with extractive activities would assess their assets for impairment at the same level as other entities&#x2014;providing a higher level of comparability than might otherwise be the case.</p></body></paragraph>
