However, many stakeholders thought that a short-term lease exemption defined in this way would provide limited cost relief for lessees. These stakeholders noted that, in their experience, a lease rarely has a maximum possible term of 12 months or less. For example, stakeholders suggested that many leases that run month-to-month would not qualify for the exemption.</p></body></paragraph>
