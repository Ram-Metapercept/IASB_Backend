In particular, any such model:</p><ol id="IFRS16_L0114" base="F45930770" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS16_P1913" base="F45930771">would result in a lessee recognising a financial liability in the balance sheet without presenting a commensurate interest expense in the income statement. Similarly, a lessee would recognise a non-financial asset without any commensurate depreciation in the income statement. These inconsistencies could distort ratio analyses performed on the basis of the amounts reported in the primary financial statements.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS16_P1914" base="F45930774">would require either the right-of-use asset or the lease liability to be measured as a balancing figure. This is because measuring (i) the right-of-use asset on the basis of cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment; and (ii) the lease liability using an effective interest method would generally not result in a straight-line lease expense.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
