This could happen if, for example, all decisions about how and for what purpose an asset is used are agreed between the customer and supplier in negotiating the contract and cannot be changed after the commencement date, or are, in effect, predetermined by the design of the asset. The IASB noted that it would expect decisions about how and for what purpose an asset is used to be predetermined in relatively few cases.</p></body></paragraph>
