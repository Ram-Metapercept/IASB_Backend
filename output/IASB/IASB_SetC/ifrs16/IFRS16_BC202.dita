Consequently, <xref base="F47962833" href="IFRS16_TOC.dita#IFRS16_TOC0001" id="IFRS16_X1000">IFRS 16</xref> requires a lessee to account for a lease modification as a separate lease if the modification increases the scope of the lease by adding the right to use one or more underlying assets and the consideration paid for the lease increases by an amount commensurate with the stand-alone price for the increase in scope.</p></body></paragraph>
