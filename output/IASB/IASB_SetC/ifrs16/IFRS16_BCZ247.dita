In other words, the weighting should reflect the leasehold interest in the land element and the buildings element of the lease at the inception date. In the extreme case that a building is fully depreciated over the lease term, the lease payments would need to be weighted to provide a return plus the full depreciation of the building&#x2019;s value at the inception of the lease. The leasehold interest in the land would, assuming a residual value that equals its value at the inception of the lease, have a weighting that reflects only a return on the initial investment. These clarifications are now in <xref id="IFRS16_X1090" base="F47968045" href="IFRS16_B56.dita#IFRS16_B56">paragraph B56 of IFRS 16</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
