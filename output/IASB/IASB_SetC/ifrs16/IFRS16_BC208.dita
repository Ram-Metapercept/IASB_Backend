In reaching this decision, the IASB noted that leasing is an important activity for many lessees. Although a lease liability shares many common characteristics with other financial liabilities, a lease liability is contractually related to a corresponding asset and often has features, such as options and variable lease payments, that differ from those typically found in other liabilities. Thus, presenting lease liabilities separately from other financial liabilities (along with the disclosure requirements discussed in <xref id="IFRS16_X1008" base="F47962836" href="IFRS16_gBC212-BC230.dita#IFRS16_gBC212-BC230/IFRS16_gBC212-BC230_TI">paragraphs BC212&#x2013;BC230</xref>) provides users of financial statements with information that is useful in understanding an entity&#x2019;s obligations arising from lease arrangements. The IASB also noted that <xref id="IFRS16_X1009" base="F47962877" href="../ias01/IAS01_55.dita#IAS01_55/IAS01_55_V2">paragraph 55 of IAS 1</xref> requires a lessee to further disaggregate line items in the balance sheet if such presentation is relevant to an understanding of the lessee&#x2019;s financial position.</p></body></paragraph>
