Such guidance would be intended to help entities to apply the <xref base="F47963203" href="../ifrs14/IFRS15_TOC.dita#IFRS15_TOC0001" id="IFRS16_X1114">IFRS 15</xref> requirements relating to the satisfaction of performance obligations to sale and leaseback transactions. However, the IASB concluded that this was not necessary because, in its view, the principles in IFRS 15 can be applied appropriately and consistently to sale and leaseback transactions without any further guidance.</p></body></paragraph>
