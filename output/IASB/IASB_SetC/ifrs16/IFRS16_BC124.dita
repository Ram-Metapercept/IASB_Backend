In the IASB&#x2019;s view, such protective rights define the scope of the rights obtained by a customer without preventing a customer from having the right to direct the use of that asset. Accordingly, protective rights may affect the price paid for the lease (ie a lessee may pay less for the use of the asset if it is more restricted in its use of that asset). However, protective rights generally would not affect the existence of the customer&#x2019;s right to direct the use of the asset.</p></body></paragraph>
