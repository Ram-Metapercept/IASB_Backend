The IASB concluded that a lessee would provide more useful information to users of financial statements by presenting interest on the lease liability together with interest on other financial liabilities and depreciation of the right-of-use asset together with other similar expenses (for example, depreciation of property, plant and equipment). <xref id="IFRS16_X1012" base="F47962878" href="IFRS16_gBC41-BC56.dita#IFRS16_gBC41-BC56/IFRS16_gBC41-BC56_TI">Paragraphs BC41&#x2013;BC56</xref> include a discussion of the basis for the IASB&#x2019;s decisions relating to amounts recognised in profit or loss by a lessee.</p></body></paragraph>
