A lessor can often, for example, sell the underlying asset (with the lease attached) or agree at any time during the initial lease term to sell or re-lease the underlying asset at the end of the lease term. The lessor&#x2019;s rights to the underlying asset arise from a past event&#x2014;the purchase of the underlying asset or commitment to a head lease, if the lessor subleases the asset. Future economic benefits from the lessor&#x2019;s retained rights in the underlying asset are expected to flow to the lessor, assuming that the lease is for anything other than the full economic life of the underlying asset. The lessor would expect to obtain economic benefits either from the sale, re-lease or use of the underlying asset at the end of the lease term.</p></body></paragraph>
