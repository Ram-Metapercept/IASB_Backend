This is because IFRS 16 requires an intermediate lessor to evaluate the classification of a sublease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease and not by reference to the underlying asset as was required by IAS 17. If an intermediate lessor were to continue to apply previous operating lease accounting to these subleases, it would recognise the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, despite the fact that, in effect, it no longer has a right to use the underlying asset. The IASB thought that this could be misleading for users of financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
