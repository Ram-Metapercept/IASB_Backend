The transition relief in IFRS 16 requires an IFRS preparer to measure the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability at the date of initial application of IFRS 16 as the carrying amount immediately before that date applying IAS 17. The rationale for this requirement is that the requirements of IAS 17 for leases classified as finance leases were similar to the requirements of IFRS 16. However, as described in <xref base="F47963538" href="IFRS16_BC300.dita#IFRS16_BC300" id="IFRS16_X1187">paragraph BC300</xref> above, the IASB cannot consider the accounting required by every other GAAP for leases that would have been classified as finance leases applying IAS 17. Consequently, the IASB concluded that carrying forward a first-time adopter&#x2019;s previous accounting could be misleading to users of financial statements, and could result in a lack of comparability with other IFRS preparers, perhaps for many years after first implementing IFRS.</p></body></paragraph>
