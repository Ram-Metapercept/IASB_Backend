Lessee accounting in <xref base="F47961976" href="IFRS16_TOC.dita#IFRS16_TOC0001" id="IFRS16_X0779">IFRS 16</xref> considers the rights and obligations created by a lease from the perspective of the lessee. As discussed further in <xref base="F47961977" href="IFRS16_gBC105-BC126.dita#IFRS16_gBC105-BC126/IFRS16_gBC105-BC126_TI" id="IFRS16_X0780">paragraphs BC105&#x2013;BC126</xref>, a lease is defined as a &#x2018;contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to use an asset (the underlying asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration&#x2019;. The lessee accounting model in IFRS 16 reflects the economics of a lease because, at the commencement date, a lessee obtains the right to use an underlying asset for a period of time, and the lessor has delivered that right by making the asset available for use by the lessee.</p></body></paragraph>
