Over the course of the Leases project, the IASB considered a number of ways of determining that reasonable expectation of what the term will be. These included:</p><ol id="IFRS16_L0137" base="F45931522" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS16_P2085" base="F45931524">requiring an entity to determine the lease term as the longest possible term that is more likely than not to occur. Many stakeholders disagreed with this approach because, in their view, it would have been complex to apply to thousands of leases (which some entities have), and it would include payments in optional periods, which many stakeholders did not view as liabilities.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS16_P2086" base="F45931525">requiring an entity to include in the lease term optional periods for which the lessee has a significant economic incentive to exercise an option. Under this approach, an expectation of exercise alone (and without any economic incentive to do so) would not be sufficient. The IASB noted that requiring an economic incentive provides a threshold that is more objective than a threshold based solely on management&#x2019;s estimates or intention, and consequently would help to address concerns that other approaches would be complex to apply. However, stakeholders were concerned about the costs of implementing any new concept regarding the lease term, particularly for entities with decentralised leasing operations and large volumes of leases with diverse individual lease term clauses. These stakeholders also asked whether a significant economic incentive threshold was similar to the &#x2018;reasonably certain&#x2019; threshold that existed in IAS 17. They suggested that, if the IASB viewed the &#x2018;significant economic incentive&#x2019; threshold as similar to the &#x2018;reasonably certain&#x2019; threshold in IAS 17, the IASB should retain the terminology in IAS 17. They argued that the IAS 17 terminology was well understood, which would help to achieve consistent application between entities.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
