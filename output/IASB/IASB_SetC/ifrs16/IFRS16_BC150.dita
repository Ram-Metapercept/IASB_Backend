This decision was made primarily to reduce complexity in applying <xref base="F47962648" href="IFRS16_TOC.dita#IFRS16_TOC0001" id="IFRS16_X0946">IFRS 16</xref>. As described in <xref base="F47962689" href="IFRS16_gBC237-BC237.dita#IFRS16_gBC237-BC237/IFRS16_gBC237-BC237_TI" id="IFRS16_X0947">paragraph BC237</xref>, the IASB also decided that the definition of initial direct costs for lessors should be consistent with the definition of &#x2018;incremental costs&#x2019; in <xref base="F47962690" href="../ifrs14/IFRS15_TOC.dita#IFRS15_TOC0001" id="IFRS16_X0948">IFRS 15</xref>. Consequently, IFRS 16 defines initial direct costs as incremental costs of obtaining a lease that would not have been incurred if the lease had not been obtained.</p></body></paragraph>
