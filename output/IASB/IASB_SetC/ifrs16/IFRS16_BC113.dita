This guidance focuses on whether the supplier has the practical ability to substitute the asset and would benefit economically from doing so. The IASB&#x2019;s intention in including this guidance is to differentiate between:</p><ol id="IFRS16_L0124" base="F45931170" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS16_P2004" base="F45931172">substitution rights that result in there being no identified asset because the supplier, rather than the customer, controls the use of an asset; and</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS16_P2005" base="F45931174">substitution rights that do not change the substance or character of the contract because it is not likely, or practically or economically feasible, for the supplier to exercise those rights.</p></li></ol><p id="IFRS16_P2006" base="F45931175">If a substitution clause is not substantive because it does not change the substance of the contract, then that substitution clause should not affect an entity&#x2019;s assessment of whether a contract contains a lease. The IASB thinks that, in many cases, it will be clear that the supplier would not benefit from the exercise of a substitution right because of the costs associated with substituting an asset.</p></body></paragraph>
