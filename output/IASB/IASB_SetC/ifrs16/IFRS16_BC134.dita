The IASB noted that the identification of separate lease components in a lease contract is similar to the identification of performance obligations in a revenue contract&#x2014;in both circumstances, an entity is trying to identify whether a customer or a lessee is contracting for a number of separate deliverables or contracting for one deliverable that may incorporate a number of different assets. Accordingly, rather than developing new requirements addressing how to identify separate lease components, the IASB decided to include in IFRS 16 requirements similar to those in <xref base="F47962547" href="../ifrs14/IFRS15_TOC.dita#IFRS15_TOC0001" id="IFRS16_X0916">IFRS 15</xref> on the identification of performance obligations. The IASB intends that those requirements in IFRS 16 are applied in a similar way to their application within the context of a revenue contract in IFRS 15.</p></body></paragraph>
