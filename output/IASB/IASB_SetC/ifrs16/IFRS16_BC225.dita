IFRS 16 supplements this requirement with a list of user information needs that any additional disclosures should address,  and with illustrative examples of disclosures that a lessee might provide in complying with the additional disclosure requirements . The IASB noted that these examples are not exhaustive. Nonetheless, the IASB thinks that the illustrative examples are useful in demonstrating that judgement should be applied in determining the most useful and relevant disclosures, which will depend on a lessee&#x2019;s individual circumstances. In the IASB&#x2019;s view, this approach facilitates the provision of more relevant and useful disclosures by (a) discouraging the use of generic or &#x2018;boilerplate&#x2019; statements; and (b) enabling a lessee to apply judgement to identify the information that is relevant to users of financial statements and focus its efforts on providing that information.</p></body></paragraph>
