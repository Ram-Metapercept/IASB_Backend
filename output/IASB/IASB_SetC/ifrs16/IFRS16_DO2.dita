Mr Zhang is of the view that a lessor should recognise a lease receivable and a residual asset for all leases for which a lessee recognises a lease liability and a right-of-use asset. He believes that it is conceptually inconsistent to require a single accounting model for lessees while retaining a dual accounting model for lessors.</p></body></paragraph>
