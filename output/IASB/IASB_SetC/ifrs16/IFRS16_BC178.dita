This is because measuring all investment property on the same basis provides more useful information than allowing an entity to choose the measurement basis for each property. <xref base="F47962739" href="IFRS16_TOC.dita#IFRS16_TOC0001" id="IFRS16_X0972">IFRS 16</xref> has amended the scope of IAS 40 by defining investment property to include both owned investment property and investment property held by a lessee as a right-of-use asset. This results in lessees using either the cost model and disclosing fair value, or using the fair value model, depending on whether the lessee accounts for the remainder of its investment property under the cost model or the fair value model. In the IASB&#x2019;s view, this approach will provide useful information to users of financial statements about the fair value of investment property held by a lessee as a right-of-use asset, which is consistent with information provided about owned investment property.</p></body></paragraph>
