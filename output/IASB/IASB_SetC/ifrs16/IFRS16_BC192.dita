The IASB considered whether some changes to the measurement of the lease liability should be recognised in profit or loss because, for example, the reassessment of an option or a change in an index or a rate could be viewed as an event relating to the current period. However, the IASB decided that a lessee should recognise the remeasurement as an adjustment to the right-of-use assets for the following reasons:</p><ol id="IFRS16_L0146" base="F45931667" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS16_P2140" base="F45931668">a change in the assessment of extension, termination or purchase options reflects the lessee&#x2019;s determination that it has acquired more or less of the right to use the underlying asset. Consequently, that change is appropriately reflected as an adjustment to the cost of the right-of-use asset.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS16_P2141" base="F45931671">a change in the estimate of the future lease payments is a revision to the initial estimate of the cost of the right-of-use asset, which should be accounted for in the same manner as the initial estimated cost.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS16_P2142" base="F45931673">the requirement to update the cost of the right-of-use asset is similar to the requirements in <xref id="IFRS16_X0989" base="F47962785" href="../ifric01/IFRIC01_TOC0001.dita#IFRIC01_TOC0001">IFRIC 1 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Changes in Existing Decommissioning, Restoration and Similar Liabilities</ph></ph></xref>.
