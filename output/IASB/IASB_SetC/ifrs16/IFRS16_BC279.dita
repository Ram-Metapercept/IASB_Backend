The IASB observed that the cumulative catch-up transition method responds to feedback from stakeholders by eliminating the need to restate financial information in comparative periods on transition and thereby reducing costs. The cost of restating comparative data could be significant because the implementation of IFRS 16 affects a number of elements of the financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
