The IASB concluded that such an approach will result in a more faithful representation of a lessee&#x2019;s assets and liabilities and, together with enhanced disclosures, greater transparency of a lessee&#x2019;s financial leverage and capital employed. To address the third criticism, IFRS 16 requires enhanced disclosure by lessors of information about their risk exposure.</p></body></paragraph>
