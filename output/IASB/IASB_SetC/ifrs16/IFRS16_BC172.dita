However, the IASB noted that residual value guarantees are often interlinked with other terms and conditions in a lease so that accounting for the guarantees as separate components could diminish the relevance and faithful representation of the information provided. Recognising such guarantees separately could also be costly to apply.</p></body></paragraph>
