This is because the IASB decided that specific requirements were not warranted because there is sufficient guidance elsewhere in IFRS. In particular, applying the requirements for offsetting in <xref base="F47963074" href="../ias01/IAS01_TOC.dita#IAS01_TOC0001" id="IFRS16_X1074">IAS 1</xref>, an intermediate lessor should not offset assets and liabilities arising from a head lease and a sublease of the same underlying asset, unless the financial instruments requirements for offsetting are met. The IASB considered whether to create an exception that would permit or require an intermediate lessor to offset assets and liabilities arising from a head lease and a sublease of the same underlying asset. However, the IASB noted that the exposures arising from those assets and liabilities are different from the exposures arising from a single net lease receivable or lease liability, and concluded that presenting these on a net basis could provide misleading information about an intermediate lessor&#x2019;s financial position, because it could obscure the existence of some transactions.</p></body></paragraph>
