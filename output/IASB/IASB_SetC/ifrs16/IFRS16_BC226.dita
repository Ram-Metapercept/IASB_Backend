However, the IASB thinks that:</p><ol base="F45931800" id="IFRS16_L0153" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>         <p base="F45931802" id="IFRS16_P2208">the measurement requirements in <xref base="F47963021" href="IFRS16_TOC.dita#IFRS16_TOC0001" id="IFRS16_X1055">IFRS 16</xref> are simplified in several ways that are expected to reduce the cost of applying IFRS 16 for a lessee, but also mean that users of financial statements need additional information to understand any significant features that are excluded from the measurement of lease liabilities. For example, a lessee is not required to include payments during optional periods unless those payments are reasonably certain to occur (see <xref base="F47963022" href="IFRS16_gBC152-BC159.dita#IFRS16_gBC152-BC159/IFRS16_gBC152-BC159_TI" id="IFRS16_X1056">paragraphs BC152&#x2013;BC159</xref>). Similarly, a lessee is not required to reassess variable lease payments unless they depend on an index or a rate and there is a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in the reference index or rate (see <xref base="F47963023" href="IFRS16_gBC188-BC190.dita#IFRS16_gBC188-BC190/IFRS16_gBC188-BC190_TI" id="IFRS16_X1057">paragraphs BC188&#x2013;BC190</xref>).</p>       </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>         <p base="F45931804" id="IFRS16_P2209">many lessees will not need to provide any additional disclosures as a result of these requirements. This is because the disclosures required by <xref base="F47963024" href="IFRS16_53.dita#IFRS16_53" id="IFRS16_X1058">paragraphs 53</xref> and <xref base="F47963025" href="IFRS16_58.dita#IFRS16_58" id="IFRS16_X1059">58 of IFRS 16</xref> are expected to provide sufficient information for those leases that do not have complex or unique features. In the IASB&#x2019;s view, it is appropriate that greater cost will be required in preparing lease disclosures for entities whose leasing activity is particularly complex or unique.</p>       </li></ol></body></paragraph>
