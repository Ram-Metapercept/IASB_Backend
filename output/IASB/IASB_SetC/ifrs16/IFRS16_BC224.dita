These features of a lease are often determined on the basis of the individual circumstances of the parties to the contract and, in some cases, are particularly complex or are unique to the particular contract. The feedback received from stakeholders demonstrated that, for these features of a lessee&#x2019;s lease portfolio, a standard disclosure requirement for all entities is unlikely to meet the needs of users of financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
