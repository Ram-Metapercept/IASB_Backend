The IASB observed that applying the concept of &#x2018;reasonably certain&#x2019; requires judgement and, therefore, also decided to provide application guidance in <xref base="F47962692" href="IFRS16_TOC.dita#IFRS16_TOC0001" id="IFRS16_X0950">IFRS 16</xref> to help entities to apply this concept.  Accordingly, when initially determining the lease term, an entity should consider all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the lessee to exercise that option. The IASB decided to include guidance on the types of facts and circumstances that an entity should consider for two reasons:</p><ol base="F45931551" id="IFRS16_L0138" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p base="F45931552" id="IFRS16_P2088">to help entities identify the relevant factors, which are not confined to the contractual payments during the optional periods. For example, within the context of property leases, the IASB noted the relevance of considering the costs of finding a new location at the end of the non-cancellable period and of relocating to that new location, or the importance of the location (for example, a head office or a flagship store) to the lessee.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p base="F45931554" id="IFRS16_P2089">to reduce the risk of non-substantive break clauses being inserted within contracts solely to reduce the lease term beyond what is economically reasonable for the lessee.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
