The IASB noted that this approach is less complex and costly to apply than requiring a lessee to reassess variable lease payments at each reporting date. This is because a lessee would typically be expected to report its financial results more frequently than the occurrence of a contractual change in the cash flows of a lease with payments that depend on an index or a rate.</p></body></paragraph>
