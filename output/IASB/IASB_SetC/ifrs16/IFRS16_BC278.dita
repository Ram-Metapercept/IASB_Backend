However, feedback from preparers indicated that, although helpful, the practical expedients proposed in the 2010 and 2013 Exposure Drafts would mitigate little of the implementation challenge of a retrospective transition approach. Furthermore, although users of financial statements find the trend information from restated comparative periods useful, many also acknowledged that the costs of full retrospective application with restatement of comparative information would be significant for many lessees and might not be justified.</p></body></paragraph>
