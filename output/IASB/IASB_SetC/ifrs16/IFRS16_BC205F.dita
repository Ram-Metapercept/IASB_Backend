Users of financial statements supported a lessee recognising in profit or loss at the       time of the covid-19 pandemic the effects of a rent concession occurring as a direct       consequence of the pandemic. Nonetheless, the Board acknowledged concerns from users of       financial statements that the practical expedient, because it is optional, could affect       comparability between lessees that apply the practical expedient and those that do       not&#x2014;disclosure of the effects of applying the practical expedient is therefore important to       meet users&#x2019; information needs. Consequently, the Board decided to require a lessee applying       the practical expedient to some or all eligible contracts to disclose that fact, as well as       the amount recognised in profit or loss to reflect changes in lease payments that arise from       rent concessions to which the practical expedient is applied (paragraph 60A of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 16</ph></ph>).</p></body></paragraph>
