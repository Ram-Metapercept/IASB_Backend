The IASB understands that this approach is similar to the way in which entities applied IAS 17, even though IAS 17 did not include explicit requirements in this respect. In response to requests from stakeholders, IFRS 16 also includes examples in the application guidance of the types of payments that are considered to be in-substance fixed payments to help in applying the requirement. </p></body></paragraph>
