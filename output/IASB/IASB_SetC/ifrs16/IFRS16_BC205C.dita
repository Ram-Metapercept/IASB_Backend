Some lessees (for example, those with systems to address changes in       lease payments) may prefer to apply, or have already applied, the requirements in paragraphs       36&#x2013;46 of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 16</ph></ph> to       all changes in lease contracts. A lessee that chooses to apply the practical expedient would be required by paragraph 2 of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 16</ph></ph> to apply it consistently to all lease contracts with similar characteristics and in similar       circumstances.</p></body></paragraph>
