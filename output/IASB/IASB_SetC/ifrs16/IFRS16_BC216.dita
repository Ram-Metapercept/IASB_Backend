However, such statements are not included in other Standards. The concept of materiality in the <ph><ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph></ph> and in <xref base="F47962927" href="../ias01/IAS01_TOC.dita#IAS01_TOC0001" id="IFRS16_X1025">IAS 1</xref> is pervasive across IFRS and applies to the requirements in <xref base="F47962928" href="IFRS16_TOC.dita#IFRS16_TOC0001" id="IFRS16_X1026">IFRS 16</xref> in the same way that it applies to the requirements in all other Standards. The IASB thought that including a statement about materiality within the disclosure requirements in IFRS 16 might be interpreted as implying that materiality does not apply to the disclosure requirements in other Standards, because materiality is not explicitly mentioned in those Standards. The IASB is of the view that implicit in the overall disclosure objective is the notion that the level of detail provided in disclosures should reflect the significance of a lessee&#x2019;s leasing activities to its financial statements. The IASB concluded that guidance on applying the overall disclosure objective would be helpful to lessees but noted that such guidance is already provided in <xref base="F47962929" href="../ias01/IAS01_30A.dita#IAS01_30A/IAS01_30A_V2" id="IFRS16_X1027">paragraphs 30A and 31 of IAS 1</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
