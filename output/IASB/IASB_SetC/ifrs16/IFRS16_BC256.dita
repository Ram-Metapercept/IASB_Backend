However, leased and owned assets are typically used for different purposes&#x2014;ie leased assets generate rental income rather than contributing towards any other revenue-generating activity of the lessor. For that reason, the IASB concluded that users of financial statements would benefit from obtaining information about leased assets that generate rental income separately from owned assets held and used by the lessor. Consequently, <xref base="F47963194" href="IFRS16_TOC.dita#IFRS16_TOC0001" id="IFRS16_X1101">IFRS 16</xref> requires a lessor to disaggregate each class of property, plant and equipment into assets subject to operating leases and assets not subject to operating leases.</p></body></paragraph>
