Some think that a lessee&#x2019;s liability to make variable lease payments does not exist until the future event requiring the payment occurs (for example, when the underlying asset is used, or a sale is made). Others think that a lessee&#x2019;s obligation to make variable lease payments exists at the commencement date by virtue of the lease contract and receipt of the right-of-use asset. Consequently, they think that all variable lease payments meet the definition of a liability for the lessee because it is the amount of the liability that is uncertain, rather than the existence of that liability.</p></body></paragraph>
