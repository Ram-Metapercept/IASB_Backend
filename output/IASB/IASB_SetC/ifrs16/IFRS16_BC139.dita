There was little support from stakeholders for including such requirements. In addition, the IASB observed that:</p><ol base="F45931288" id="IFRS16_L0131" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p base="F45931290" id="IFRS16_P2052">the accounting for leases that are similar to the sale or purchase of the underlying asset would be similar to that for sales and purchases applying the respective requirements of <xref base="F51967351" href="../ifrs14/IFRS15_TOC.dita#IFRS15_TOC0001/IFRS15_TOC0001_V2" id="IFRS16_X0928">IFRS 15</xref> and <xref base="F47962599" href="../ias16/IAS16_TOC.dita#IAS16_TOC0001/IAS16_TOC0001_V2" id="IFRS16_X0929">IAS 16</xref>; and</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p base="F45931292" id="IFRS16_P2053">accounting for a transaction depends on the substance of that transaction and not its legal form. Consequently, if a contract grants rights that represent the in-substance purchase of an item of property, plant and equipment, those rights meet the definition of property, plant and equipment in IAS 16 and would be accounted for applying that Standard, regardless of whether legal title transfers. If the contract grants rights that do not represent the in-substance purchase of an item of property, plant and equipment but that meet the definition of a lease, the contract would be accounted for applying IFRS 16.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
