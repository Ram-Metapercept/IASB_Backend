In the IASB&#x2019;s view, the intermediate lessor&#x2019;s accounting should be based on the asset that the intermediate lessor controls (ie the right-of-use asset) and not the underlying asset that is controlled by the head lessor.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS16_P2220" base="F45931831">an intermediate lessor&#x2019;s risks associated with a right-of-use asset can be converted into credit risk by entering into a sublease, the term of which covers most or all of the term of the head lease. Accounting for such a sublease as a finance lease (by classifying it by reference to the right-of-use asset) would reflect that risk, because the intermediate lessor would recognise the net investment in the sublease (a receivable) rather than a right-of-use asset.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS16_P2221" base="F45931833">if a sublease is for all of the remaining term of the corresponding head lease, the intermediate lessor no longer has the right to use the underlying asset. In the IASB&#x2019;s view, it is appropriate for an intermediate lessor in such a case to derecognise the right-of-use asset and recognise the net investment in the sublease.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
