Many stakeholders thought that it could be difficult to interpret when a change in the right-of-use asset or lease liability is significant. In addition, stakeholders were concerned about both the costs of performing reassessment and, if relevant, the costs associated with demonstrating that reassessment was not required, which might be as costly as reassessing options at each reporting date.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS16_P2134" base="F45931651"><i>requiring a lessee to reassess options when the lessee has, or no longer has, a significant economic incentive that would make exercise of an option reasonably certain</i>. Many stakeholders thought that the cost of applying this approach would exceed any benefit, because an entity might incur significant costs in continuously assessing and monitoring relevant factors that give rise to a significant economic incentive even though the lease term conclusion might not change.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
