The Board learned that lessees could find it challenging to assess       whether a potentially large volume of covid-19-related rent concessions are lease       modifications and, for those that are, to apply the required accounting in <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 16</ph></ph>, especially       in the light of the many challenges lessees face during the pandemic. Further, those       challenges arising during the pandemic add to the work undertaken by lessees in implementing       the new lessee accounting model in <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 16</ph></ph>. The Board concluded that the practical expedient       would provide relief to lessees, while enabling lessees to continue providing useful       information about their leases to users of financial statements (see paragraph BC205F). To       provide the relief when needed most, the Board enabled immediate application of the amendment       in any financial statements&#x2014;interim or annual&#x2014;not authorised for issue at the date the       amendment was issued.</p></body></paragraph>
