The Board decided not to amend the requirements for accounting for modifications to lease contracts from the lessor&#x2019;s perspective. The Board did not make such amendments because, for finance leases, a lessor is required to apply the requirements in <xref href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_TOC.dita#IFRS09_TOC0001" scope="local"><ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 9</ph></ph></xref> to a lease modification, so the amendments in <xref href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_g5.4.5-5.4.9.dita" scope="local">paragraphs 5.4.5&#x2013;5.4.9 of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 9</ph></ph></xref> would apply when those modifications are required by the reform. For operating leases, the Board decided that applying the requirements in <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 16</ph></ph> for lessors will provide useful information about the modification in terms and conditions required by the reform in the light of the mechanics of the operating lease accounting model.</p></body></paragraph>
