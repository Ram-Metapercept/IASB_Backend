A requirement to apply the exemption by class of underlying asset, instead of lease-by-lease, would have introduced a burden on lessees to assess every individual asset within a class. Consequently, in the IASB&#x2019;s view, the recognition exemption for leases of low-value assets will be easier to apply, and of more benefit to lessees, if applied on a lease-by-lease basis.</p></body></paragraph>
