Consequently, IFRS 16 does not contain detailed transition requirements for leases previously classified as finance leases if a lessee elects to apply the cumulative catch&#x2011;up transition approach. For these leases, IFRS 16 requires a lessee to measure the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability at the date of initial application of IFRS 16 as the carrying amount of the lease asset and lease liability immediately before that date applying the finance lease accounting requirements in IAS 17.</p></body></paragraph>
