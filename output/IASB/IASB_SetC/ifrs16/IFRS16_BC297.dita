However, in the IASB&#x2019;s view, the costs associated with measuring lease assets and lease liabilities at fair value would outweigh the benefits because obtaining fair value information might be difficult and, thus, costly. The IASB also noted that, when the acquiree is a lessee, the requirements of IFRS 3 (as amended by <xref base="F47963529" href="IFRS16_TOC.dita#IFRS16_TOC0001" id="IFRS16_X1177">IFRS 16</xref>) for the measurement of lease assets and lease liabilities would result in the recognition of a net carrying amount for the lease at the date of acquisition that approximates the fair value of the lease at that date.</p></body></paragraph>
