The IASB concluded that this approach will provide useful information to users of financial statements. This is because it is consistent with the approach used to measure other similar assets and liabilities and thus is expected to result in more comparable information than other approaches. The IASB also concluded that using a cost measurement basis will be less costly for preparers than other approaches.</p></body></paragraph>
