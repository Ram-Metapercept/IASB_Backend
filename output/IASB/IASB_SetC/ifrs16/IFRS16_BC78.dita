Consequently, some stakeholders suggested that long-term leases of land should be excluded from the scope of <xref base="F47962260" href="IFRS16_TOC.dita#IFRS16_TOC0001" id="IFRS16_X0839">IFRS 16</xref>. However, the IASB decided not to specifically exclude such leases from the scope of IFRS 16 because:</p><ol base="F45931039" id="IFRS16_L0122" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p base="F45931040" id="IFRS16_P1964">there is no conceptual basis for differentiating long-term leases of land from other leases. If the contract does not transfer control of the land to the lessee, but gives the lessee the right to control the use of the land throughout the lease term, the contract is a lease and should be accounted for as such.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p base="F45931042" id="IFRS16_P1965">for a long-term lease of land (for example, a 99-year lease), the present value of the lease payments is likely to represent substantially all of the fair value of the land. In this case, the accounting applied by the lessee will be similar to accounting for the purchase of the land. If the lessee obtains control of the land, it will account for the contract as the purchase of the land by applying <xref base="F47962261" href="../ias16/IAS16_TOC.dita#IAS16_TOC0001/IAS16_TOC0001_V2" id="IFRS16_X0840">IAS 16 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Property, Plant and Equipment</ph></ph></xref>, rather than by applying IFRS 16.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
