This practical expedient requires remeasurement of the lease liability using a discount rate that reflects the change to the basis for determining the variable lease payments as required by the reform. This practical expedient would apply to all lease modifications that change the basis for determining future lease payments that are required as a result of the reform (see <xref href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_5.4.6.dita" scope="local">paragraphs 5.4.6</xref> and <xref href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_5.4.8.dita" scope="local">5.4.8 of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 9</ph></ph></xref>). For this purpose, consistent with the amendments to <xref href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_TOC.dita#IFRS09_TOC0001" scope="local"><ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 9</ph></ph></xref>, a lease modification required by the reform is a lease modification that satisfies two conditions&#x2014;the modification is necessary as a direct consequence of the reform and the new basis for determining the lease payments is economically equivalent to the previous basis (ie the basis immediately preceding the modification).</p></body></paragraph>
