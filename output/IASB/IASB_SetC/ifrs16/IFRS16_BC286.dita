This is because the effect of the less costly option (measuring the right-of-use asset equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any previously recognised prepaid or accrued lease payments) is an increase in operating expense (ie higher depreciation) for the remainder of the term of the lease. The IASB concluded that a lessee is expected to select the less costly option only for leases for which the costs of applying a more accurate transition approach outweigh the benefit of achieving a &#x2018;correct&#x2019; post-transition income statement. The IASB expects this to apply to leases that are high in volume but low in value but not to leases such as long-term leases of property or large equipment.</p></body></paragraph>
