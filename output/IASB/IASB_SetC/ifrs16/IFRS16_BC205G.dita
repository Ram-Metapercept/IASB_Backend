The main effect on cash flows       would be the reduction or absence of cash outflows for leases during the period of the rent       concession. For a concession that adjusts the carrying amount of the lease liability, a lessee       would disclose this effect as a non-cash change in lease liabilities applying paragraph 44A of         <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 7</ph>         <ph outputclass="standard_title">Statement of Cash Flows</ph></ph>. The Board noted that       cash flow effects, and other information about, for example, the nature of rent concessions,       would be relevant regardless of whether a lessee applies the practical expedient. The Board       expected paragraphs 51 and 59 of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 16</ph></ph> to require a lessee to disclose such       information, if material.</p></body></paragraph>
