The IASB decided that, to control the use of an asset, a customer is required to have not only the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of an asset throughout the period of use (a &#x2018;benefits&#x2019; element) but also the ability to direct the use of that asset (a &#x2018;power&#x2019; element), ie a customer must have decision-making rights over the use of the asset that give it the ability to influence the economic benefits derived from use of the asset throughout the period of use. Without any such decision-making rights, the customer would have no more control over the use of the asset than any customer purchasing supplies or services. If this were the case, the customer would not control the use of the asset. This guidance is consistent with the concept of control in <xref base="F47962488" href="../ifrs10/IFRS10_TOC.dita#IFRS10_TOC0001" id="IFRS16_X0891">IFRS 10</xref> and <xref base="F47962489" href="../ifrs14/IFRS15_TOC.dita#IFRS15_TOC0001" id="IFRS16_X0892">IFRS 15</xref>, and with the IASB&#x2019;s proposals regarding control in the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> Exposure Draft. IFRS 10 and IFRS 15 define control to require both a &#x2018;benefits&#x2019; element and a &#x2018;power&#x2019; element.</p></body></paragraph>
