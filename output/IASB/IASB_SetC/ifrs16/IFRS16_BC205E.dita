The practical expedient does not otherwise interpret or change any requirements in <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 16</ph></ph>. The Board observed therefore that a lessee would account for the lease liability and right-of-use asset applying the requirements in <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 16</ph></ph>, which, for example, incorporate requirements in <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 16</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Property, Plant and Equipment</ph></ph>. With this in mind, the Board considered how a lessee applying the practical expedient would account for three types of change in lease payments:</p><ol type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>         <p>a lessee applying the practical expedient would generally account for a forgiveness or waiver of lease payments as a variable lease payment applying paragraph 38 of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 16</ph></ph>. The lessee would also make a corresponding adjustment to the lease liability&#x2014;in effect, derecognising the part of the lease liability that has been forgiven or waived.</p>       </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>         <p>a change in lease payments that reduces payments in one period but proportionally increases payments in another does not extinguish the lessee&#x2019;s lease liability or change the consideration for the lease&#x2014;instead, it changes only the timing of individual payments. In this case, applying paragraph 36 of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 16</ph></ph>, a lessee would continue to both recognise interest on the lease liability and reduce that liability to reflect lease payments made to the lessor.</p>       </li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value>         <p>some covid-19-related rent concessions reduce lease payments, incorporating both a forgiveness or waiver of payments and a change in the timing of payments.</p>       </li></ol></body></paragraph>
