Such a requirement might also impose additional cost on preparers, particularly when leases that are referenced to a benchmark rate that is subject to the reform are expected to be amended at different times. This is because preparers would have to determine a new incremental borrowing rate at the effective date of each such lease modification.</p></body></paragraph>
