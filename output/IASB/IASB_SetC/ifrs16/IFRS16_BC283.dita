Consequently, the 2010 Exposure Draft proposed that the right-of-use asset should be measured at an amount equal to the lease liability on transition, adjusted for any impairment. However, many stakeholders noted that this approach would increase lease-related costs artificially in the years immediately following transition to IFRS 16 (because the depreciation charge would typically be higher than if IFRS 16 had always been applied). These stakeholders thought that the artificial increase in the depreciation charge immediately after transition would distort the financial information provided to users of financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
