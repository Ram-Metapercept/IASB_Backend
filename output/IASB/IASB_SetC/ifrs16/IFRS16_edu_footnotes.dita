The seller-lessee has determined that the variable               payments are not in-substance fixed payments as described in IFRS 16.</p>           </li></ol>         <p>The request asked how, in the transaction described, the seller-lessee measures the           right-of-use asset arising from the leaseback, and thus determines the amount of any gain           or loss recognised at the date of the transaction.</p>         <p>The Committee observed that the requirements applicable to the transaction described in           the request are in paragraph 100 of IFRS 16. Paragraph 100 states that &#x2018;if the transfer of           an asset by the seller-lessee satisfies the requirements of IFRS 15 to be accounted for as           a sale of the asset: (a) the seller-lessee shall measure the right-of-use asset arising           from the leaseback at the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the asset that           relates to the right of use retained by the seller-lessee. Accordingly, the seller-lessee           shall recognise only the amount of any gain or loss that relates to the rights transferred           to the buyer-lessor. &#x2026;&#x2019;.</p>         <p>Consequently, to measure the right-of-use asset arising from the leaseback, the           seller-lessee determines the proportion of the PPE transferred to the buyer-lessor that           relates to the right of use retained&#x2014;it does so by comparing, at the date of the           transaction, the right of use it retains via the leaseback to the rights comprising the           entire PPE. IFRS 16 does not prescribe a method for determining that proportion. In the           transaction described in the request, the seller-lessee could determine the proportion by           comparing, for example, (a) the present value of expected payments for the lease           (including those that are variable), with (b) the fair value of the PPE at the date of the           transaction. </p>         <p>The gain or loss the seller-lessee recognises at the date of the transaction is a           consequence of its measurement of the right-of-use asset arising from the leaseback.           Because the right of use the seller-lessee retains is not remeasured as a result of the           transaction (it is measured as a proportion of the PPE&#x2019;s previous carrying amount), the           amount of the gain or loss recognised relates only to the rights transferred to the           buyer-lessor. Applying paragraph 53(i) of IFRS 16, the seller-lessee discloses gains or           losses arising from sale and leaseback transactions.</p>         <p>The seller-lessee also recognises a liability at the date of the transaction, even if all           the payments for the lease are variable and do not depend on an index or rate. The initial           measurement of the liability is a consequence of how the right-of-use asset is           measured&#x2014;and the gain or loss on the sale and leaseback transaction determined&#x2014;applying           paragraph 100(a) of IFRS 16.</p>         <p><b><i>lllustrative example</i></b></p>         <p><i>Seller-lessee enters into a sale and leaseback transaction whereby it transfers an             asset (PPE) to Buyer-lessor, and leases that PPE back for five years.

All the payments for the lease             (which are at market rates) are variable, calculated as a percentage of Seller-lessee&#x2019;s             revenue generated using the PPE during the five-year lease term.

Consequently, the proportion of the PPE             that relates to the rights transferred to Buyer-lessor is 75%, calculated as             (CU1,800,000 &#x2212; CU450,000) &#x00F7; CU1,800,000. </i></p>         <p outputclass="keep_with_next"><i>Applying paragraph 100(a), Seller-lessee:</i>           <ol type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value><i>a.</i></li_value>               <p><i>measures the right-of-use asset at CU250,000, calculated as CU1,000,000                   (previous carrying amount of the PPE) × 25% (proportion of the PPE that relates to                   the right of use it retains).</i></p>             </li><li><li_value><i>b.</i></li_value>               <p><i>recognises a gain of CU600,000 at the date of the transaction, which is the gain                   that relates to the rights transferred to Buyer-lessor.

The request asked whether a lessee&#x2019;s incremental borrowing rate is           required to reflect the interest rate in a loan with both a similar maturity to the lease           and a similar payment profile to the lease payments.</p>         <p>Applying IFRS 16, a lessee uses its incremental borrowing rate in measuring a lease           liability when the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined           (paragraph 26 of IFRS 16). Appendix A to IFRS 16 defines a lessee&#x2019;s incremental borrowing           rate as &#x2018;the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar           term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar           value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment&#x2019;. The lessee&#x2019;s           incremental borrowing rate is therefore a lease-specific rate that the Board defined &#x2018;to           take into account the terms and conditions of the lease&#x2019; (paragraph BC162).</p>         <p>In determining its incremental borrowing rate, the Board explained in paragraph BC162           that, depending on the nature of the underlying asset and the terms and conditions of the           lease, a lessee may be able to refer to a rate that is readily observable as a starting           point. A lessee would then adjust such an observable rate as is needed to determine its           incremental borrowing rate as defined in IFRS 16.</p>         <p outputclass="keep_with_next">The Committee observed that the definition of a lessee&#x2019;s           incremental borrowing rate requires a lessee to determine its incremental borrowing rate           for a particular lease considering the terms and conditions of the lease, and determine a           rate that reflects the rate it would have to pay to borrow:</p>         <ol type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>a.</li_value>             <p>over a similar term to the lease term;</p>           </li><li><li_value>b.</li_value>             <p>with a similar security to the security (collateral) in the lease;</p>           </li><li><li_value>c.</li_value>             <p>the amount needed to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset               arising from the lease; and</p>           </li><li><li_value>d.</li_value>             <p>in a similar economic environment to that of the lease.</p>           </li></ol>         <p>The definition of a lessee&#x2019;s incremental borrowing rate in IFRS 16 does not explicitly           require a lessee to determine its incremental borrowing rate to reflect the interest rate           in a loan with a similar payment profile to the lease payments. Nonetheless, the Committee           observed that, in applying judgement in determining its incremental borrowing rate as           defined in IFRS 16, it would be consistent with the Board&#x2019;s objective when developing the           definition of incremental borrowing rate for a lessee to refer as a starting point to a           readily observable rate for a loan with a similar payment profile to that of the           lease.</p>         <p>The Committee concluded that the principles and requirements in IFRS 16 provide an           adequate basis for a lessee to determine its incremental borrowing rate.

In           the contract described in the request, a pipeline operator (customer) obtains the right to           place an oil pipeline in underground space for 20 years in exchange for consideration. The           contract specifies the exact location and dimensions (path, width and depth) of the           underground space within which the pipeline will be placed. The landowner retains the           right to use the surface of the land above the pipeline, but it has no right to access or           otherwise change the use of the specified underground space throughout the 20-year period           of use.

Accordingly, if the contract contains a lease, IFRS 16           applies to that lease. If the contract does not contain a lease, the entity would then           consider which other IFRS Standard applies.</p>         <p>The Committee therefore concluded that the entity first considers whether the contract           contains a lease as defined in IFRS 16.</p>         <p outputclass="keep_with_next" typeface="sansserif">The definition of a lease</p>         <p>Paragraph 9 of IFRS 16 states that &#x2018;a contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract           conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in           exchange for consideration&#x2019;.

The           Board noted in paragraph BC121 of IFRS 16 that &#x2018;it would expect decisions about how and           for what purpose an asset is used to be predetermined in relatively few cases&#x2019;.</p>         <p>The Committee observed that, in the fact pattern described in the request, because not           all relevant decisions about how and for what purpose the ship is used are predetermined,           the customer considers paragraph B24(a) of IFRS 16 in assessing whether it has the right           to direct the use of the ship.</p>         <p outputclass="keep_with_next"><b><i>The right to direct how and for what purpose an asset               is used</i></b></p>         <p>Paragraph B24(a) specifies that a customer has the right to direct the use of an           identified asset throughout the period of use if it has &#x2018;the right to direct how and for           what purpose the asset is used throughout the period of use (as described in paragraphs           B25&#x2013;B30)&#x2019;.</p>         <p>To have the right to direct how and for what purpose the asset is used, within the scope           of its right of use defined in the contract, the customer must be able to change how and           for what purpose the asset is used throughout the period of use (paragraph B25). In           assessing whether that is the case, an entity considers rights to make decisions during           the period of use that are most relevant to changing how and for what purpose the asset is           used throughout that period. Decision-making rights are relevant when they affect the           economic benefits to be derived from use (paragraph B25).

The rent concession is one for which the only           change to the lease contract is the lessor&#x2019;s forgiveness of lease payments due from the           lessee under that contract.</p>         <p typeface="sansserif">The fact pattern</p>         <p>The request described a rent concession agreed by a lessor and a lessee on the date the           rent concession is granted. The rent concession changes the original terms and conditions           of a lease contract classified by the lessor&#x2014;applying IFRS 16&#x2014;as an operating lease. The           lessor legally releases the lessee from its obligation to make specifically identified           lease payments:</p>         <ol type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>a.</li_value><p>some of these lease payments are amounts contractually due             but not paid. Paragraph AG9 of IAS 32 states that &#x2018;a lessor does not regard an             operating lease as a financial instrument, except as regards individual payments             currently due and payable by the lessee&#x2019;. Therefore, the lessor has recognised these             amounts as an operating lease receivable. Applying paragraph 81 of IFRS 16, the lessor             has also recognised the amounts as income.</p></li><li><li_value>b.</li_value><p>some of these lease payments are not yet contractually             due.</p></li></ol>         <p>No other changes are made to the lease contract, nor are there any other negotiations           between the lessor and the lessee that might affect the accounting for the rent           concession. Before the date the rent concession is granted, the lessor applies the           expected credit loss model in IFRS 9 to the operating lease receivable.</p>         <p typeface="sansserif">The question</p>         <p outputclass="keep_with_next">The request asked:</p>         <p>&#x2026;</p>         <ol type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>b.</li_value><p>whether the lessor applies the derecognition requirements in             IFRS 9 or the lease modification requirements in IFRS 16 in accounting for the rent             concession.</p></li></ol>         <p>&#x2026;</p>         <p typeface="sansserif">Accounting for the rent concession&#x2014;IFRS 9 and IFRS 16</p>         <p><i>Applying the derecognition requirements in IFRS 9 to the operating lease           receivable</i></p>         <p>Paragraph 2.1(b)(i) of IFRS 9 states that operating lease receivables recognised by a           lessor are subject to the derecognition requirements in IFRS 9. Consequently, on granting           the rent concession, the lessor considers whether the requirements for derecognition in           paragraph 3.2.3 of IFRS 9 are met.</p>         <p>In the rent concession described in the request, the lessor legally releases the lessee           from its obligation to make specifically identified lease payments, some of which the           lessor has recognised as an operating lease receivable. Accordingly, on granting the rent           concession, the lessor concludes that the requirements in paragraph 3.2.3(a) of IFRS 9           have been met&#x2014;that is, its contractual rights to the cash flows from the operating lease           receivable expire&#x2014;because it has agreed to legally release the lessee from its obligation           and thus has given up its contractual rights to those specifically identified cash flows.           Therefore, on the date the rent concession is granted, the lessor remeasures expected           credit losses on the operating lease receivable (and recognises any change to the expected           credit loss allowance in profit or loss) and derecognises the operating lease receivable           (and associated expected credit loss allowance).</p>         <p><i>Applying the lease modification requirements in IFRS 16 to future lease payments under           the lease</i></p>         <p>The rent concession described in the request meets the definition of a lease modification           in IFRS 16. The rent concession is &#x2018;a change in &#x2026; the consideration for a lease &#x2026; that was           not part of the original terms and conditions of the lease&#x2019;. Therefore, the lessor applies           paragraph 87 of IFRS 16 and accounts for the modified lease as a new lease from the date           the rent concession is granted.</p>         <p>Paragraph 87 of IFRS 16 requires a lessor to consider any prepaid or accrued lease           payments relating to the original lease as part of the lease payments for the new lease.           The Committee observed that lease payments contractually due from the lessee that the           lessor has recognised as an operating lease receivable (to which the derecognition and           impairment requirements in IFRS 9 apply) are not accrued lease payments. Consequently,           neither those lease payments nor their forgiveness are considered&#x2014;applying paragraph 87 of           IFRS 16&#x2014;as part of the lease payments for the new lease.</p>         <p>In accounting for the modified lease as a new lease, a lessor applies paragraph 81 of           IFRS 16 and recognises the lease payments (including any prepaid or accrued lease payments           relating to the original lease) as income on either a straight-line basis or another           systematic basis.</p>         <p>The Committee concluded that the lessor accounts for the rent concession described in the           request on the date it is granted by applying: (a) the derecognition requirements in IFRS           9 to forgiven lease payments that the lessor has recognised as an operating lease           receivable; and (b) the lease modification requirements in IFRS 16 to forgiven lease           payments that the lessor has not recognised as an operating lease receivable.</p>         <p typeface="sansserif">Conclusion</p>         <p>The Committee concluded that the principles and requirements in IFRS Accounting Standards           provide an adequate basis for a lessor to determine how to apply the expected credit loss           model in IFRS 9 to an operating lease receivable and account for the rent concession           described in the request. Consequently, the Committee decided not to add a           standard-setting project to the work plan.</p>         <p>[The full text of the agenda decision is reproduced after paragraph 2.1 of IFRS 9.]]</p>       </fn>     </bodydiv></body></topic>
