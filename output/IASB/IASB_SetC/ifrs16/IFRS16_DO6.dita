This is because, in his view, the materiality guidance in IFRS and the recognition exemption for short-term leases in IFRS 16 should be sufficient to identify those leases for which the costs of recognising assets and liabilities would outweigh the benefits. When leases of low-value assets are material in the aggregate, Mr Zhang believes that recognising assets and liabilities has significant benefit. Mr Zhang also thinks that the costs of recognising assets and liabilities would be mitigated because an entity would have a record of leases of low-value assets for internal control purposes. The only incremental cost might be the cost associated with applying a discount rate to the lease payments.</p></body></paragraph>
