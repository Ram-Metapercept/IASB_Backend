The Discussion Paper set out the Boards&#x2019; preliminary views on lessee accounting, proposing a &#x2018;right-of-use&#x2019; accounting model. Feedback on the Discussion Paper generally supported the &#x2018;right-of-use&#x2019; model for lessees, by which a lessee would recognise a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the commencement date of the lease. The Discussion Paper did not discuss lessor accounting in any detail.</p></body></paragraph>
