Determining the fair value would involve projecting the cash flows that the entity expects to receive from subleasing the asset. The IASB concluded that, for an entity that is not in the property industry, determining these cash flows would normally be relatively straightforward because it is likely that a sublease would already be in place.</p></body></paragraph>
