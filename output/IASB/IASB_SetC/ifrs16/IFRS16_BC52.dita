The measurement proposals for variable lease payments and optional lease periods were simplified in the 2013 Exposure Draft, and these simplifications have been retained in <xref base="F47962074" href="IFRS16_TOC.dita#IFRS16_TOC0001" id="IFRS16_X0799">IFRS 16</xref>. As described in <xref base="F47962075" href="IFRS16_BC18.dita#IFRS16_BC18" id="IFRS16_X0800">paragraph BC18</xref>, the IASB also introduced a number of further simplifications and exemptions after considering feedback on the 2013 Exposure Draft. The IASB expects the simpler measurement requirements and exemptions in IFRS 16 to alleviate many of the concerns that were received in response to the single model proposed in the 2010 Exposure Draft.</p></body></paragraph>
