Accordingly, a lessor may classify similar leases (for example, those with a similar lease term for a similar underlying asset) differently depending on whether the lessor owns or leases the underlying asset. However, the IASB concluded that any difference in classification reflects real economic differences. The intermediate lessor only has a right to use the underlying asset for a period of time. If the sublease is for all of the remaining term of the head lease, the intermediate lessor has in effect transferred that right to another party. In contrast, in an operating lease of an owned asset, the lessor would expect to derive economic benefits from the underlying asset at the end of the lease term.</p></body></paragraph>
