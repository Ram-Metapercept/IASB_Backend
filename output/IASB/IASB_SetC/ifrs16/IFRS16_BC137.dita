The IASB acknowledged that the stand-alone price of lease and non-lease components might not be readily available and, consequently, decided to permit the use of estimates, maximising the use of observable information.  In the IASB&#x2019;s view, the use of estimated stand-alone prices by a lessee, if observable prices are not readily available, addresses some of the most significant concerns raised by both lessors and lessees with respect to the separation of lease and non-lease components: lessors had expressed concerns about providing pricing information to lessees and lessees had expressed concerns that obtaining observable stand-alone pricing information that is not readily available could be onerous and costly. The IASB also observed that applying the previous requirements in IAS 17, a lessee had been required to allocate the consideration in a contract between lease and non-lease components using estimates of the relative fair value of those components. The IASB was not aware of any significant practical difficulties in applying those requirements.</p></body></paragraph>
