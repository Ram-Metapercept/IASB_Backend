Instead, the customer obtains the service only at the time that the service is performed. Consequently, the customer typically has an unconditional obligation to pay only for the services provided to date. In addition, although fulfilment of a service contract will often require the use of assets, fulfilment typically does not require making those assets available for use by the customer throughout the contractual term.</p></body></paragraph>
