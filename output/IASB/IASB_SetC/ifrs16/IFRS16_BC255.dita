However, the IASB concluded that such a requirement could be onerous for lessors. Although it is fundamental to a lessor&#x2019;s business that the lessor manage its exposure to residual asset risk, the IASB thought that the costs associated with having to disclose, and have audited, fair value information about residual assets would outweigh the benefit for users of financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
