The IASB did not want to prevent a lessee from applying IFRS 16 to leases of intangible assets for which there are no specific requirements in other Standards. The IASB acknowledged that there is no conceptual basis for excluding leases of intangible assets from the scope of IFRS 16 for lessees. However, the IASB concluded that a separate and comprehensive review of the accounting for intangible assets should be performed before requiring leases of intangible assets to be accounted for applying the requirements of IFRS 16. Many stakeholders agreed with this approach.</p></body></paragraph>
