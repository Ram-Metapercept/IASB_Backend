The IASB thinks that users of financial statements would find information about the maturities of any contractual commitments of an entity useful, regardless of the nature of the entity&#x2019;s rights under the contract. However, the IASB noted that it could be misleading to require the disclosure of contractual commitments for services that are embedded within a lease without also requiring the disclosure of contractual commitments for services that are provided as part of other contracts. The IASB decided that adding such a disclosure requirement would be beyond the scope of the Leases project.</p></body></paragraph>
