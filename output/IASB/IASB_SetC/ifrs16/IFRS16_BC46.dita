Most users consulted (including almost all of those who analyse industrial, airline, transport and telecommunications sectors) were of the view that leases create assets and &#x2018;debt-like&#x2019; liabilities. Consequently, they thought that recognising interest on lease liabilities separately from depreciation of right-of-use assets would be beneficial to their analyses, particularly in assessing the operating performance of an entity. The separate recognition of those expenses would be particularly beneficial for those users of financial statements who use reported information for their analyses without making further adjustments&#x2014;it would create greater comparability in the income statement between entities that borrow to buy assets and those that lease similar assets. Separating interest and depreciation would also provide coherency between the lessee&#x2019;s balance sheet and income statement (ie the interest expense would correspond to the lease liabilities presented as financial liabilities, and depreciation would correspond to the right-of-use assets presented as non-financial assets). This coherency is important for some analyses, such as calculating return on capital employed and some leverage ratios.</p></body></paragraph>
