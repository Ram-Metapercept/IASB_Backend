If a lessee expects to exercise an option to extend the lease term, some think that including that longer lease term in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability would provide a more faithful representation of the economics of the lease. Inclusion of some renewal options is also needed to mitigate the risk of lessees inappropriately excluding lease liabilities from the balance sheet (for example, by excluding lease payments in optional periods for which the lessee has a clear economic incentive to exercise those options).</p></body></paragraph>
