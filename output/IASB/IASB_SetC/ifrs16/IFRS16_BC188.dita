For example, without such remeasurement, the measurement of the lease liability for a 20-year property lease, for which lease payments are linked to an inflation index, is unlikely to provide users of financial statements with useful information about the entity&#x2019;s future cash outflows relating to that lease throughout the lease term.</p></body></paragraph>
