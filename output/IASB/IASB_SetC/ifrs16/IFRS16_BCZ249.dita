In such cases the benefits of separating the lease into two elements and accounting for each separately may not outweigh the costs. The IASB noted that generally accepted accounting principles in Australia, Canada and the US allow or require such leases to be classified and accounted for as a single unit, with finance lease treatment being used when the relevant criteria are met. The IASB decided to allow land and buildings to be treated as a single unit when the land element is immaterial. This exception is now in <xref id="IFRS16_X1092" base="F47963147" href="IFRS16_B57.dita#IFRS16_B57">paragraph B57 of IFRS 16.</xref></p></body></paragraph>
