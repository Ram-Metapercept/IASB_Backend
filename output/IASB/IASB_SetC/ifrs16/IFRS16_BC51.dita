The IASB reached this conclusion for three main reasons:</p> <ol id="IFRS16_L0116" base="F45930784" type="lower-roman"><li><li_value>(i)</li_value> <p id="IFRS16_P1917" base="F45930785">most users of financial statements consulted think that leases create assets and &#x2018;debt-like&#x2019; liabilities for a lessee. Consequently, they benefit from lessees recognising interest on those liabilities in a similar way to interest on other financial liabilities, because that enables them to perform meaningful ratio analyses. The same is true regarding the recognition of depreciation of right-of-use assets in a similar way to depreciation of other non-financial assets such as property, plant and equipment. The model is particularly beneficial for those users that rely on reported information without making adjustments.</p></li><li><li_value>(ii)</li_value> <p id="IFRS16_P1918" base="F45930787">the model is easy to understand&#x2014;a lessee recognises assets and financial liabilities, and corresponding amounts of depreciation and interest.</p></li><li><li_value>(iii)</li_value> <p id="IFRS16_P1919" base="F45930789">the model addresses the concern of some users of financial statements that a dual model would perpetuate the risk of structuring to create a particular accounting outcome.</p></li></ol></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS16_P1920" base="F45930780">accounting for all leases recognised in the balance sheet in the same way appropriately reflects the fact that all leases result in a lessee obtaining the right to use an asset, regardless of the nature or remaining life of the underlying asset.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS16_P1921" base="F45930782">a single model reduces cost and complexity by removing the need to classify leases and the need for systems that can deal with two lessee accounting approaches.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
