Consequently, a seller-lessee should not perform any retrospective accounting specific to the sale element of a sale and leaseback transaction on transition to <xref base="F47963476" href="IFRS16_TOC.dita#IFRS16_TOC0001" id="IFRS16_X1169">IFRS 16</xref>. A seller-lessee is required to account for the leaseback on transition to IFRS 16 in the same way as it accounts for any other lease that is in existence at the date of initial application.</p></body></paragraph>
