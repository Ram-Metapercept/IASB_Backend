In reaching this decision, the IASB noted that payments resulting from a residual value guarantee cannot be avoided by the lessee&#x2014;the lessee has an unconditional obligation to pay the lessor if the value of the underlying asset moves in a particular way. Accordingly, any uncertainty relating to the payment of a residual value guarantee does not relate to whether the lessee has an obligation. Instead, it relates to the amount that the lessee may have to pay, which can vary in response to movements in the value of the underlying asset. In that respect, residual value guarantees are similar to variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate for the lessee.</p></body></paragraph>
