Although simple to apply, the IASB did not adopt this approach because the measurement of lease assets and lease liabilities would ignore the existence of options, including those that are virtually certain to be exercised. Consequently, this approach would potentially misrepresent the assets and liabilities arising from a lease.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS16_P2078" base="F45931352"><i>a measurement approach</i>, in which options in a lease are included in the measurement of lease assets and lease liabilities using a particular method.
