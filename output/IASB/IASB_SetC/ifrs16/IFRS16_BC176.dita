In the IASB&#x2019;s view, this requirement enables users of financial statements to better compare assets that a lessee owns with those that it leases. In addition, it could be difficult for a lessee to implement an impairment model for right-of-use assets that is different from the model applied to other non-financial assets, particularly if a lessee is required to assess a group of assets (comprising both leased and owned assets) for impairment together.</p></body></paragraph>
