In the IASB&#x2019;s view, if a customer specifies the output from an asset at or before the beginning of the period of use (for example, within the terms of the contract), and cannot change that specification during the period of use, it generally does not control the use of an asset. In that case, it would have no more decision-making rights than any customer in a typical supply or service contract.</p></body></paragraph>
