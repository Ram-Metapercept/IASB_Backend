The IASB concluded that, if right-of-use assets are not presented as a line item, presenting similar leased and owned assets together would provide more useful information to users of financial statements than other approaches. This is because a lessee often uses owned assets and leased assets for the same purpose and derives similar economic benefits from the use of owned assets and leased assets.</p></body></paragraph>
