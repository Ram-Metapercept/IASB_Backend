In either of these cases the customer controls rights of use that extend beyond the rights of a customer in a typical supply or service contract (ie the customer has rights that extend beyond solely ordering and receiving output from the asset). In these cases, the customer has the right to make (or has made in the case of design) decisions that affect the economic benefits to be derived from use of the asset throughout the period of use. Although the IASB thinks that each of these cases represents a scenario in which the customer directs the use of an asset, it expects that, for most leases, the assessment of whether a customer directs the use of an asset will be based on identifying the party that decides how and for what purpose an asset is used.</p></body></paragraph>
