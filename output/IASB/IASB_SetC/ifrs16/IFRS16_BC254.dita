Uncertainty about the residual value of the underlying asset at the end of the lease is often a lessor&#x2019;s primary risk. Accordingly, <xref base="F47963151" href="IFRS16_TOC.dita#IFRS16_TOC0001" id="IFRS16_X1099">IFRS 16</xref> requires a lessor to disclose information about how it manages its risk associated with any rights it retains in the underlying asset. The IASB also noted that disclosing information about residual asset risk will also provide users of financial statements with useful information about the distribution of risk for a lessor between credit risk relating to lease payments receivable and residual asset risk related to the interest in the underlying asset.</p></body></paragraph>
