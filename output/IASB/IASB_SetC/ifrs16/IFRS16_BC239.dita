The IASB expects that this approach will not result in any substantive change to previous lessor accounting for modifications of finance leases. This is because, although IAS 17 did not include requirements relating to lease modifications, the IASB understands that a lessor generally applied an approach that was consistent with the requirements in IFRS 9 (or the equivalent requirements in IAS 39 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement</ph></ph>) to the net investment in a finance lease.</p></body></paragraph>
