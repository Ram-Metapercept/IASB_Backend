Some substitution rights are not substantive because the contract restricts when a supplier can substitute the asset. For example, if a contract states that a supplier can substitute the asset only on a specified future date or after the occurrence of a specified event, that substitution right is not substantive because it does not give the supplier the practical ability to substitute the asset throughout the period of use. Other substitution rights are not substantive even if the supplier contractually has the right to substitute the asset at any time. For example, if a supplier substitutes an asset for purposes of repair and maintenance, or if a supplier would benefit from substitution only in circumstances that are not considered likely to arise, those substitution rights are not substantive, regardless of whether those circumstances are specified in the contract.</p></body></paragraph>
