This is because users would prefer IFRS 16 to have the same effective date as <xref base="F70459558" href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_TOC.dita#IFRS09_TOC0001" id="IFRS16_X1124">IFRS 9</xref> and <xref base="F47963253" href="../ifrs14/IFRS15_TOC.dita#IFRS15_TOC0001" id="IFRS16_X1125">IFRS 15</xref>&#x2014;this would avoid accounting uncertainty arising from entities implementing new Standards over a number of years. Users of financial statements also noted that, in their view, the effective date of IFRS 16 should be as soon as possible in the light of the significant improvements in financial reporting that will result from the implementation of IFRS 16. Consequently, they did not support a period of three years between publication of IFRS 16 and the effective date.</p></body></paragraph>
