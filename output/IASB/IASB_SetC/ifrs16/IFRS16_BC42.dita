In the light of these comments, the IASB concluded that there would be significant benefits from requiring a lessee to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases (except short-term leases and leases of low-value assets as described in <xref id="IFRS16_X0794" base="F47962028" href="IFRS16_gBC87-BC104.dita#IFRS16_gBC87-BC104/IFRS16_gBC87-BC104_TI">paragraphs BC87&#x2013;BC104</xref>), particularly for users of financial statements and others who have raised concerns about the extent of off balance sheet financing provided through operating leases.</p></body></paragraph>
