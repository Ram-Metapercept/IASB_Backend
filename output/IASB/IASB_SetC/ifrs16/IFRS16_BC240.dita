This approach is consistent with the approach required by <xref base="F47963144" href="../ifrs14/IFRS15_TOC.dita#IFRS15_TOC0001" id="IFRS16_X1087">IFRS 15</xref> if, at the time of a contract modification (that is accounted for as a separate contract), the remaining goods or services to be transferred are distinct from the goods or services already transferred. It is also expected that this approach will not result in any substantive change to previous lessor accounting.</p></body></paragraph>
