Consequently, the IASB decided to permit lessees to choose, on a lease-by-lease basis, how to measure the right-of-use asset on transition to IFRS 16. <xref base="F47963428" href="IFRS16_gC8-C10.dita#IFRS16_gC8-C10/IFRS16_gC8-C10_TI" id="IFRS16_X1155">Paragraph C8(b)</xref> permits a lessee either to measure the right-of-use asset as if IFRS 16 had always been applied or to measure the right-of-use asset at an amount equal to the lease liability (adjusted by the amount of any previously recognised prepaid or accrued lease payments).</p></body></paragraph>
