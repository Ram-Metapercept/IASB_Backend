However, forecasting changes in an index or a rate requires macroeconomic information that may not be readily available to all entities, and may result in measurement uncertainty. The IASB noted that the usefulness of the enhanced information obtained using such a forecast often might not justify the costs of obtaining it, particularly for those lessees with a high volume of leases. The IASB considered requiring a lessee to use forward rates when measuring lease liabilities if those rates are readily available. However, it decided not to do so because this would reduce comparability between those using forward rates and those not doing so. Consequently, at initial recognition, <xref base="F47962733" href="IFRS16_TOC.dita#IFRS16_TOC0001" id="IFRS16_X0961">IFRS 16</xref> requires a lessee to measure payments that depend on an index or a rate using the index or rate at the commencement date (ie a lessee does not estimate future inflation but, instead, measures lease liabilities using lease payments that assume no inflation over the remainder of the lease term).</p></body></paragraph>
