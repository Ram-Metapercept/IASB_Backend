For example, the sale price might be more than the fair value of the asset because the leaseback rentals are above a market rate; conversely the sale price might be less than the fair value because the leaseback rentals are below a market rate. Accounting for the transaction using those amounts could result in the misstatement of gains or losses on disposal of the asset for the seller-lessee and the misstatement of the carrying amount of the asset for the buyer-lessor. Consequently, <xref base="F47963247" href="IFRS16_TOC.dita#IFRS16_TOC0001" id="IFRS16_X1118">IFRS 16</xref> requires that if the sale consideration or leaseback rentals are not at market rates, any below-market terms should be accounted for as a prepayment of lease payments and any above-market terms should be accounted for as additional financing provided by the buyer-lessor to the seller-lessee. Similarly, IFRS 16 requires the seller-lessee to measure the right-of-use asset as a proportion of the asset retained as a result of the leaseback&#x2014;consequently any off-market terms are effectively accounted for in measuring the gain or loss on sale.</p></body></paragraph>
