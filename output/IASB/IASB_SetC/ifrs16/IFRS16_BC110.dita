This is because a lessor is required to classify a lease as either a finance lease or an operating lease at the inception date; this is consistent with the previous lessor lease classification requirements in IAS 17, which the IASB decided not to change. In addition, a lessee is required to disclose information about leases not yet commenced to which the lessee is committed if that information is relevant to users of financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
