In reaching this decision, the IASB noted that early application would allow any entity that wishes to apply IFRS 16 at the same time as <xref base="F70459561" href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_TOC.dita#IFRS09_TOC0001" id="IFRS16_X1134">IFRS 9</xref> and IFRS 15 to do so. The IASB also noted that early application might be beneficial to an entity that adopts IFRS for the first time between the publication of IFRS 16 and its effective date. However, the IASB decided to limit early application of IFRS 16 to entities that also apply IFRS 15. This is because some of the requirements of IFRS 16 depend on an entity also applying the requirements of IFRS 15 (and not the Standards that were superseded by IFRS 15).</p></body></paragraph>
