For example, right-of-use assets may be viewed as being (a) less risky than owned assets, because a right-of-use asset may not embed residual asset risk; or (b) more risky than owned assets, because the lessee may need to replace the right-of-use asset at the end of the lease term, but may not be able to secure a similar rate for the replacement lease. Accordingly, <xref base="F47962835" href="IFRS16_TOC.dita#IFRS16_TOC0001" id="IFRS16_X1006">IFRS 16</xref> requires a lessee to provide information about the carrying amount of right-of-use assets separately from assets that are owned, either in the balance sheet or in the notes.</p></body></paragraph>
