Similarly, if a lessee&#x2019;s leasing activities are material to its financial statements, but the effect of measuring lease liabilities on a discounted basis is not material, the lessee would not be required to measure its lease liabilities on a discounted basis and could instead, for example, measure them on an undiscounted basis.</p></body></paragraph>
