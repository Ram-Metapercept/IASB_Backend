The Boards also conducted extensive outreach on the proposals in the 2010 Exposure Draft. Round table discussions were held in Hong Kong, the United Kingdom and the United States. Workshops were organised in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, South Korea, the UK and the US. Members of the Boards also participated in conferences, working group meetings, discussion forums, and one-to-one discussions that were held across all major geographical regions. In 2011 and 2012, while redeliberating the proposals in the 2010 Exposure Draft, the Boards conducted additional targeted outreach with more than 100 organisations. The purpose of the targeted outreach was to obtain additional feedback to assist the Boards in developing particular aspects of the revised proposals. The targeted outreach meetings involved international working group members, representatives from accounting firms, local standard-setters, users and preparers of financial statements, particularly those from industries most affected by the lease accounting proposals.</p></body></paragraph>
