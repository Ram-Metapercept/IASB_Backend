A lease does not convey ownership of an underlying asset; it conveys only the right to use that underlying asset. Accordingly, the IASB concluded that, when considering whether a contract contains a lease, a customer should not consider economic benefits relating to ownership of an asset (for example, tax benefits as a result of owning an asset). However, a customer should consider benefits relating to the use of the asset (for example, renewable energy credits received from the use of an asset or by-products resulting from the use of an asset).</p></body></paragraph>
