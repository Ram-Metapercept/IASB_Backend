In the view of those lessees and users, recognising lease expenses for property leases on a straight-line basis reflects the nature of the transaction. For example, some noted that, when a lessee enters into a typical five-year lease of retail space, the lessee is simply paying to use the retail space rather than consuming any of the value of the underlying asset. In their view, a lessee should recognise these rentals on a straight-line basis.</p></body></paragraph>
