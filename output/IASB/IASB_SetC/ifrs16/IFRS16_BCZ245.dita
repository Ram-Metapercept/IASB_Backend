The Exposure Draft of the 2003 amendments had further proposed that, whenever necessary for the purposes of classification, the lease payments should be allocated between the land and building elements in proportion to their relative fair values at the inception of the lease. However, respondents to that Exposure Draft had questioned whether the relevant fair values were the fair values of the underlying land and buildings or the fair values of the leasehold interests in the land and buildings.</p></body></paragraph>
