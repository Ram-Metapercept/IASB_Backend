Some stakeholders had suggested that &#x2018;short-term&#x2019; should be up to five years. The IASB, however, did not adopt this approach because, for example, three-year leases are more likely to give rise to material assets and liabilities than 12 month leases, and the objective of the project was to ensure greater transparency about an entity&#x2019;s leasing activities.</p></body></paragraph>
