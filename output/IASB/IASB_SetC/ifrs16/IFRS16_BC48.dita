Some of those users view leases of property as executory contracts. For them, a single lease expense recognised within operating expenses would have best satisfied their needs. However, other users of the financial statements of retailers, hoteliers and restaurateurs had estimated an allocation of operating lease expense between depreciation and interest in their analyses based on previous lessee accounting requirements. Consequently, those users thought that requiring a lessee to recognise interest on lease liabilities separately from depreciation of right-of-use assets would provide them with information that is useful for their analyses.</p></body></paragraph>
