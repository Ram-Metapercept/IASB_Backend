The IASB considered ways in which <xref base="F47962783" href="IFRS16_TOC.dita#IFRS16_TOC0001" id="IFRS16_X0983">IFRS 16</xref> could address that concern while still providing useful information to users of financial statements.

The IASB noted that this requirement is similar in some respects to the approach taken for the impairment of long-lived assets (other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets) in <xref base="F47962784" href="../ias36/IAS36_TOC0001.dita#IAS36_TOC0001/IAS36_TOC0001_V2" id="IFRS16_X0984">IAS 36</xref>. IAS 36 does not require impairment testing at each reporting date. Instead, an entity tests for impairment when there has been an indication that the asset may be impaired.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p base="F45931643" id="IFRS16_P2130">requiring reassessment only if the significant event or significant change in circumstances is within the control of the lessee. Limiting the reassessment requirement in this way means that a lessee is not required to reassess options in response to purely market-based events or changes in circumstances.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
