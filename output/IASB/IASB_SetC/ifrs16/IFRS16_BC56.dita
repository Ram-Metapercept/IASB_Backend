For both approaches, the most significant cost associated with a new lessee accounting model would be the cost associated with recognising and measuring right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases. Although the approach decided upon by the FASB would have retained the classification requirements of IAS 17 (which are familiar to lessees), it would still have required a lessee to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on a discounted basis for all leases (with some exceptions).</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
