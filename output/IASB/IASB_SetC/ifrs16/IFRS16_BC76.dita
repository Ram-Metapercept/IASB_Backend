For example, would office buildings used by a bank be a core asset, and would the conclusion be different if the bank has retail banking operations? Would an entity consider some offices or cars to be core assets and others non-core? If core assets were defined as those essential to the operations of an entity, it could be argued that every lease would be a lease of a core asset. Otherwise, why would an entity enter into the lease?</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS16_P1960" base="F45931030">different entities might interpret the meaning of non-core assets differently, thereby reducing comparability for users of financial statements.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS16_P1961" base="F45931033">other Standards do not distinguish between core and non-core purchased assets. Because of this, it would be difficult to justify distinguishing a right-of-use asset relating to a core asset from one that relates to a non-core asset.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
