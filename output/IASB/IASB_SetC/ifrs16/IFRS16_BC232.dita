The IASB concluded that this approach is appropriate because in general each contract is negotiated separately, with the counterparty to the sublease being a different entity from the counterparty to the head lease. Accordingly, for an intermediate lessor, the obligations that arise from the head lease are generally not extinguished by the terms and conditions of the sublease.</p></body></paragraph>
