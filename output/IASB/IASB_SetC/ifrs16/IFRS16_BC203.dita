The IASB decided that:</p><ol id="IFRS16_L0148" base="F45931706" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS16_P2158" base="F45931707">for lease modifications that decrease the scope of a lease, a lessee should decrease the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset to reflect the partial or full termination of the lease and recognise a corresponding gain or loss. In the IASB&#x2019;s view, this gain or loss appropriately reflects the economic effect of the partial or full termination of the existing lease resulting from the decrease in scope.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS16_P2159" base="F45931709">for all other lease modifications, a lessee should make a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset. In these cases, the original lease is not terminated because there is no decrease in scope. The lessee continues to have the right to use the underlying asset identified in the original lease. For lease modifications that increase the scope of a lease, the adjustment to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset effectively represents the cost of the additional right of use acquired as a result of the modification. For lease modifications that change the consideration paid for a lease, the adjustment to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset effectively represents a change in the cost of the right-of-use asset as a result of the modification. The use of a revised discount rate in remeasuring the lease liability reflects that, in modifying the lease, there is a change in the interest rate implicit in the lease (which the discount rate is intended to approximate).</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
