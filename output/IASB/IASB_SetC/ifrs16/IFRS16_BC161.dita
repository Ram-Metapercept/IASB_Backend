This is because both rates, as they have been defined in <xref base="F47962696" href="IFRS16_TOC.dita#IFRS16_TOC0001" id="IFRS16_X0956">IFRS 16</xref>, take into account the credit standing of the lessee, the length of the lease, the nature and quality of the collateral provided and the economic environment in which the transaction occurs. However, the interest rate implicit in the lease is generally also affected by a lessor&#x2019;s estimate of the residual value of the underlying asset at the end of the lease, and may be affected by taxes and other factors known only to the lessor, such as any initial direct costs of the lessor. Consequently, the IASB noted that it is likely to be difficult for lessees to determine the interest rate implicit in the lease for many leases, particularly those for which the underlying asset has a significant residual value at the end of the lease.</p></body></paragraph>
