A contract will either fail to meet the definition of a lease by failing to meet many of the requirements or will clearly meet the requirements to be a lease without requiring a significant amount of judgement. However, application guidance has been added to make it easier for entities to make the lease assessment for more complicated scenarios.</p></body></paragraph>
