That is because a lessee would include only lease payments for the duration of the lease term as an asset and a liability, irrespective of the maximum possible term. For example, for a lease with an extension option after six months which the lessee is not reasonably certain to exercise, the lease term is six months. If that lease were not captured by the short-term lease exemption (because the maximum term is longer than the lease term), the lessee would include only lease payments for the six&#x2011;month lease term in measuring the asset and liability. Consequently, by aligning the determination of short-term with the determination of lease term, the only incremental change in information would be that the lessee would no longer reflect the six months of lease payments on its balance sheet.</p></body></paragraph>
