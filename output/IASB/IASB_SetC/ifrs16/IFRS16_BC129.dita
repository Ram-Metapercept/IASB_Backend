However, the IASB is of the view that such clauses are unlikely to be added because there often is an economic disincentive for either the lessor or lessee to agree to their inclusion. For example, if a lessor has priced a contract assuming that the lessee will not cancel the contract, including such a clause would put the lessor at risk of being exposed to higher residual asset risk than had been anticipated when pricing the contract, which would be an economic disincentive for the lessor. Conversely, if the lessor has priced the contract assuming that the lessee will or may cancel the contract, the lessee would be likely to have to pay higher rentals to compensate the lessor for taking on more residual asset risk. Those higher rentals would be an economic disincentive for the lessee, if it does not intend to cancel the contract.</p></body></paragraph>
