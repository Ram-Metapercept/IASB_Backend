A lessee does not obtain and control its right to use the underlying asset until the commencement date. Before that date, the lessor has not yet performed under the contract. Although a lessee may have a right and an obligation to exchange lease payments for a right-of-use asset from the date of inception, the lessee is unlikely to have an obligation to make lease payments before the asset is made available for its use. The IASB noted that an obligation to exchange payments for a right-of-use asset could be onerous if the terms of the exchange are unfavourable. In such circumstances, a lessee could have an onerous contract liability before the commencement date. That liability would be accounted for consistently with other onerous contracts applying <xref base="F47962641" href="../ias37/IAS37_TOC.dita#IAS37_TOC0001" id="IFRS16_X0936">IAS 37</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
