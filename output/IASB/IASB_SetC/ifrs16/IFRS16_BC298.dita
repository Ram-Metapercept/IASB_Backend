Such a requirement would be consistent with the general principles of <xref base="F47963531" href="../ifrs03/IFRS03_TOC.dita#IFRS03_TOC0001/IFRS03_TOC0001_V2" id="IFRS16_X1179">IFRS 3</xref>, under which assets and liabilities relating to contracts with off-market terms are recognised separately in the balance sheet and not subsumed within goodwill on acquisition. However, the IASB observed that the effect of any such off-market terms would rarely be material for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. Consequently, it decided not to include this requirement in IFRS 3.</p></body></paragraph>
