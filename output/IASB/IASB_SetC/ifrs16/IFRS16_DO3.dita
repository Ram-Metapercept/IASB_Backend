<paragraph id="IFRS16_DO3" base="F45932147"><paranum>DO3</paranum><prolog><data name="standard_number" value="IFRS 16"/><data name="paranum" value="DO3"/></prolog><body><p id="IFRS16_P2334">Mr Zhang agrees with the IASB&#x2019;s view set out in paragraphs BC35&#x2013;BC36 that a lessor&#x2019;s right to receive lease payments arising from a lease is a financial asset. Mr Zhang believes that this financial asset should be reflected as such in a lessor&#x2019;s financial statements, and thus Mr Zhang disagrees with the conclusions reached in paragraphs BC57&#x2013;BC66 regarding the costs and benefits of changing the lessor accounting model in IAS 17. This is because the nature of the risks associated with a financial asset are different from those of the underlying asset, and information about those different risks is of great importance to users of a lessor&#x2019;s financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
