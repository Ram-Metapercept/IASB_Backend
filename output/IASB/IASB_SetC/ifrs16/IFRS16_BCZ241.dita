IAS 17 had previously stated that a lease of land with an indefinite economic life would normally be classified as an operating lease. However, in 2009, the IASB removed that statement from IAS 17, having concluded that it might lead to a classification of land that does not reflect the substance of the transaction.</p></body></paragraph>
