The 2013 Exposure Draft proposed using a control principle as the means of distinguishing between a service and a lease, and to align the principle with that in other Standards. Respondents generally supported these changes. However, many respondents stressed the increased importance of the definition of a lease, noting that the assessment of whether a contract contains a lease would generally determine whether a customer would recognise lease assets and lease liabilities. Some of these respondents thought that the IASB had not provided adequate guidance to support consistent application of the proposed definition to more complicated scenarios.</p></body></paragraph>
