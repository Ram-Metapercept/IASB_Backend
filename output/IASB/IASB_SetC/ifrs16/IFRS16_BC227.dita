Such information could have included, for example, the basis and terms and conditions on which variable lease payments and options are determined. However, lessees informed the IASB that this information would be difficult to capture in a meaningful way, particularly for large or diverse lease portfolios. Some users of financial statements also expressed concerns that such an approach could lead to &#x2018;boilerplate&#x2019; compliance statements, which generally do not provide useful information. The approach taken enables lessees to determine the best way to provide information while considering both the costs of providing that information and the information needs of users of financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
