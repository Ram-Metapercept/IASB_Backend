Consequently, <xref id="IFRS16_X0858" base="F47962338" href="IFRS16_g5-8.dita#IFRS16_g5-8/IFRS16_g5-8_TI">paragraph 5(a) of IFRS 16</xref> permits a lessee to elect not to apply the recognition requirements to short-term leases. Instead, a lessee can recognise the lease payments associated with short-term leases as an expense over the lease term, typically on a straight-line basis. The IASB decided that this choice should be made by class of underlying asset.</p></body></paragraph>
