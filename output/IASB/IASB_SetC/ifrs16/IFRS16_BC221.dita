The IASB thinks that, in a scenario in which disclosing undiscounted cash flows for each of the first five years and a total for the periods thereafter provides the most useful information to users of financial statements, the requirements of IFRS 7 should lead a lessee to disclose this level of detail. In contrast, in a scenario in which an alternative (and possibly more detailed) set of time bands provides the most useful information to users of financial statements, the requirements of IFRS 7 should lead a lessee to disclose that alternative and more useful set of time bands. For example, for a portfolio of 15&#x2013;20 year leases, the requirements of IFRS 7 should lead a lessee to provide a more detailed maturity analysis than a single amount for the years beyond the fifth year.</p></body></paragraph>
