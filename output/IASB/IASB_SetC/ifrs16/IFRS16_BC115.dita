Difficulties may arise because the customer often does not have information about the costs of substitution that would be incurred by the supplier. On the basis of this feedback, the IASB decided to state in <xref base="F47962441" href="IFRS16_TOC.dita#IFRS16_TOC0001" id="IFRS16_X0888">IFRS 16</xref> that, if a customer cannot readily determine whether a supplier has a substantive substitution right, then the customer should presume that any substitution right is not substantive. It is intended that a customer should assess whether substitution rights are substantive if it is reasonably able to do so&#x2014;if substitution rights are substantive, then the IASB thinks that this would be relatively clear from the facts and circumstances. However, the requirement is also intended to clarify that a customer is not expected to exert undue effort in order to provide evidence that a substitution right is not substantive.</p></body></paragraph>
