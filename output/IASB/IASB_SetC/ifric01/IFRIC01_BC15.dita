They observed that liabilities relating to decommissioning costs can be regarded as negative residual values, and suggested that the Interpretation should not introduce inconsistent treatment for similar events. Anomalies could result if two aspects of the same change are dealt with differently&#x2014;for example, if the useful life of an asset was extended and the present value of the decommissioning liability reduced as a result.</p></body></paragraph>
