The IFRIC noted that: </p><ol id="IFRIC01_L0014" base="SL146237" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRIC01_P0231" base="SL146239">if the entity chooses the revaluation model, <xref id="IFRIC01_X0147" base="F398244" href="../IAS16.ditamap">IAS 16</xref> requires the valuation to be kept sufficiently up to date that the carrying amount does not differ materially from that which would be determined using fair value at the balance sheet date.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRIC01_FN0004" type="fn"/> This Interpretation requires a change in a recognised decommissioning, restoration or similar liability generally to be added to or deducted from the cost of the asset. However, a change in the liability does not, of itself, affect the <i>valuation</i> of the asset for financial reporting purposes, because (to ensure that it is not counted twice) the separately recognised liability is excluded from its valuation.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRIC01_P0232" base="SL146241">rather than changing the valuation of the asset, a change in the liability affects the difference between what would have been reported for the asset under the cost model, under this Interpretation, and its valuation. In other words, it changes the revaluation surplus or deficit that has previously been recognised for the asset. For example, if the liability increases by CU20, which under the cost model would have been added to the cost of the asset, the revaluation surplus reduces (or the revaluation deficit increases) by CU20. Under the revaluation model set out in <xref id="IFRIC01_X0148" base="F398245" href="../IAS16.ditamap">IAS 16</xref>, cumulative revaluation surpluses for an asset are accounted for in equity,<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRIC01_FN0005" type="fn"/> and cumulative revaluation deficits are accounted for in profit or loss. The IFRIC decided that changes in the liability relating to a revalued asset should be accounted for in the same way as other changes in revaluation surpluses and deficits under <xref id="IFRIC01_X0149" base="F398246" href="../IAS16.ditamap">IAS 16</xref>.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRIC01_P0233" base="SL146243">although a change in the liability does not directly affect the value of the asset for financial reporting purposes, many events that change the value of the liability may also affect the value of the asset, by either a greater or lesser amount. The IFRIC therefore decided that, for revalued assets, a change in a decommissioning liability indicates that a revaluation may be required. Any such revaluation should be taken into account in determining the amount taken to profit or loss under (b) above. If a revaluation is done, <xref id="IFRIC01_X0150" base="F398247" href="../IAS16.ditamap">IAS 16</xref> requires all assets of the same class to be revalued.</p></li><li><li_value>(d)</li_value> <p id="IFRIC01_P0234" base="SL146245">the depreciated cost of an asset (less any impairment) should not be negative, regardless of the valuation model, and the revaluation surplus on an asset should not exceed its value. The IFRIC therefore decided that, if the reduction in a liability exceeds the carrying amount that would have been recognised had the asset been carried under the cost model, the excess reduction should always be taken to profit or loss. For example, if the depreciated cost of an unimpaired asset is CU25, and its revalued amount is CU100, there is a revaluation surplus of CU75. If the decommissioning liability associated with the asset is reduced by CU30, the depreciated cost of the asset should be reduced to nil, the revaluation surplus should be increased to CU100 (which equals the value of the asset), and the remaining CU5 of the reduction in the liability should be taken to profit or loss.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
