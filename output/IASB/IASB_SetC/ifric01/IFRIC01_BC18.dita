The IFRIC noted that the first concern could be dealt with if the assets were reviewed for impairment in accordance with <xref id="IFRIC01_X0137" base="F398205" href="../IAS36.ditamap">IAS 36 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Impairment of Assets</ph></ph></xref>, and that a zero asset floor could be applied to ensure that an asset did not become negative if cost estimates reduced significantly towards the end of its life. The credit would first be applied to write the carrying amount of the asset down to nil and then any residual credit adjustment would be recognised in profit or loss. These safeguards are included in the final consensus.</p></body></paragraph>
