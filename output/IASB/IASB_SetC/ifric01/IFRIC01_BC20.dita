However, the IFRIC agreed that because <xref id="IFRIC01_X0138" base="F398206" href="../IAS37.ditamap">IAS 37</xref> requires a decommissioning obligation to reflect the effect of a change in the current market&#x2011;based discount rate (see <xref id="IFRIC01_X0139" base="F15826211" href="IFRIC01_BC3.dita#IFRIC01_BC3">paragraph BC3</xref>), it was not possible to disregard changes in the discount rate. Furthermore, SFAS 143 did not treat changes in cash flows and discount rates in the same way, which the IFRIC had agreed was important.</p></body></paragraph>
