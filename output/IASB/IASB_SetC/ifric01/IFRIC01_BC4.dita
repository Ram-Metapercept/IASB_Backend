The issue is whether changes in the liability should be recognised in current period profit or loss, or added to (or deducted from) the cost of the related asset. <xref id="IFRIC01_X0120" base="F398161" href="../IAS16.ditamap">IAS 16</xref> contains requirements for the initial capitalisation of decommissioning costs and <xref id="IFRIC01_X0121" base="F398162" href="../IAS37.ditamap">IAS 37</xref> contains requirements for measuring the resulting liability; neither specifically addresses accounting for the effect of changes in the liability. The IFRIC was informed that differing views exist, resulting in a risk of divergent practices developing.</p></body></paragraph>
