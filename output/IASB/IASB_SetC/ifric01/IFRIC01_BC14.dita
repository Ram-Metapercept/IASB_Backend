For example, as <xref id="IFRIC01_X0136" base="F398204" href="../IAS08.ditamap">IAS 8</xref> also acknowledges, a change in the estimated useful life of, or the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in, a depreciable asset affects depreciation expense for the current period and for each future period during the asset&#x2019;s remaining useful life. In both cases, the effect of the change relating to the current period is recognised in profit or loss in the current period. The effect, if any, on future periods is recognised in profit or loss in those future periods.</p></body></paragraph>
