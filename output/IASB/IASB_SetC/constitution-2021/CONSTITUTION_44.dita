The       members of the ISSB are appointed by the Trustees under <xref href="CONSTITUTION_16.dita#CONSTITUTION_16">section 16(a)</xref>. A minority of ISSB members       may be part-time members (the expression &#x2018;part-time&#x2019; meaning that the members concerned commit       most of their time to paid employment by the IFRS Foundation) and shall meet appropriate       guidelines of independence established by the Trustees. The remaining members shall be       full-time members (the expression &#x2018;full-time&#x2019; meaning that the members concerned commit all of       their time to paid employment by the IFRS Foundation). The work of the ISSB shall not be       invalidated by its failure at any time to have a full complement of members, although the       Trustees shall use their best endeavours to achieve a full complement.</p></body></paragraph>
