These skills include the ability to communicate effectively in private       meetings with members of the IASB, in public meetings, and in written materials such as IFRS       Accounting Standards, speeches, articles, memos and external correspondence. Communication       skills also include the ability to listen to and consider the views of others. While a working       knowledge of English is necessary, there should be no discrimination in selection against       those for whom English is not their first language.</p></body></paragraph>
