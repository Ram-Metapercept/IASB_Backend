This relationship seeks to replicate, on an international basis, the link       between corporate reporting standard-setters and those public authorities that have generally       overseen corporate reporting standard-setters. A Memorandum of Understanding will be agreed       between the Monitoring Board and the Trustees describing the interaction of the Monitoring       Board with the Trustees. This Memorandum of Understanding will be made available to the       public.</p></body></paragraph>
