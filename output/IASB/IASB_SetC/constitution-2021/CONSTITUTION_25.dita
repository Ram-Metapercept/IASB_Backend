The members of the IASB are       appointed by the Trustees under <xref href="CONSTITUTION_16.dita#CONSTITUTION_16">sectionÂ 16(a)</xref>. Up to three members may be part-time members (the expression       &#x2018;part-time&#x2019; meaning that the members concerned commit most of their time to paid employment by       the IFRS Foundation) and shall meet appropriate guidelines of independence established by the       Trustees. The remaining members shall be full-time members (the expression &#x2018;full-time&#x2019; meaning       that the members concerned commit all of their time to paid employment by the IFRS       Foundation). The work of the IASB shall not be invalidated by its failure at any time to have       a full complement of members, although the Trustees shall use their best endeavours to achieve       a full complement.</p></body></paragraph>
