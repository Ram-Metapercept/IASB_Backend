<paragraph id="CONSTITUTION_51"><paranum>51</paranum><prolog><data name="standard_number" value="IFRS Foundation"/><data name="paranum" value="51"/></prolog><body><p id="P0001">The Trustees shall develop rules and procedures to ensure that the ISSB is, and is       seen to be, independent, and, in particular, on appointment, full-time members of the ISSB       shall sever all employment relationships with current employers and shall not hold any       position giving rise to economic incentives that might call into question their independence       of judgement in setting IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards. Secondments and any rights       to return to an employer would, therefore, not be permitted. Part-time members of the ISSB       would not be expected to sever all other employment arrangements but must be able to       demonstrate and maintain a sufficient level of independence.</p></body></paragraph>
