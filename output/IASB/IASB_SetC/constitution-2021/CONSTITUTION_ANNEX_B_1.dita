A broad base       of skills, experience and perspectives is needed, therefore ISSB members may also have       professional backgrounds that reflect a diverse range of expertise and roles that are relevant       to sustainability. The credibility of the ISSB and its individual members and the       effectiveness and efficiency of the organisation will be enhanced by members who have such       knowledge and skills from recent experience.</p></body></paragraph>
