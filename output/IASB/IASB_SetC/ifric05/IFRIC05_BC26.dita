Therefore, the IFRIC concluded that the nature of the contributor&#x2019;s interest and the restriction on access should be disclosed. The IFRIC also concluded that this disclosure is equally relevant when a contributor&#x2019;s interest in a fund is accounted for by consolidation, proportional consolidation<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRIC05_FN0023" type="fn"/> or using the equity method because the contributor&#x2019;s ability to access the underlying assets may be similarly restricted.</p></body></paragraph>
