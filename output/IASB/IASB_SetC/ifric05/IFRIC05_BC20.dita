However, the IFRIC agreed that an asset should not be recognised for other rights to receive reimbursement from the fund. Although the IFRIC had sympathy with the concerns expressed by constituents that there may be circumstances in which it would seem appropriate to recognise an asset in excess of the reimbursement right, it concluded that it would be inconsistent with <xref base="F74900239" href="../ias37/IAS37_g53-58.dita#IAS37_g53-58/IAS37_g53-58_TI" id="IFRIC05_X0114">paragraph 53 of IAS 37</xref> (which requires that &#x2018;the amount recognised for the reimbursement should not exceed the amount of the provision&#x2019;) to recognise this asset. The IFRIC also noted that the circumstances in which this additional asset exists are likely to be limited, and apply only when a contributor has restricted access to a surplus of fund assets that does not give it control, joint control or significant influence over a fund. The IFRIC expects that most such assets would not meet the recognition criteria in the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph><xref keyref="footnotes/IFRIC05_FN0020" type="fn"/> because they are highly uncertain and cannot be measured reliably.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
