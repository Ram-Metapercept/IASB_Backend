Such an obligation is a present obligation of the contributor, but the outflow of resources associated with it may not be probable. The IFRIC noted a parallel with the example in <xref base="F49287018" href="../ias37/IAS37_29.dita#IAS37_29" id="IFRIC05_X0116">paragraph 29 of IAS 37</xref>, which states that &#x2018;where an entity is jointly and severally liable for an obligation, the part of the obligation that is expected to be met by other parties is treated as a contingent liability.&#x2019; Accordingly, the IFRIC concluded that a liability would be recognised by the contributor only if it is probable that it will make additional contributions. The IFRIC noted that such a contingent liability may arise both when the contributor&#x2019;s interest in the fund is accounted for as a reimbursement right and when it is accounted for in accordance with <xref base="F49287019" href="../ias27/IAS27_TOC0001.dita#IAS27_TOC0001/IAS27_TOC0001_V3" id="IFRIC05_X0117">IAS 27</xref>, <xref base="F49287021" href="../ias28/IAS28_TOC.dita#IAS28_TOC0001/IAS28_TOC0001_V3" id="IFRIC05_X0118">IAS 28</xref>, IAS 31<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRIC05_FN0021" type="fn"/> or SIC&#x2011;12.</p></body></paragraph>
