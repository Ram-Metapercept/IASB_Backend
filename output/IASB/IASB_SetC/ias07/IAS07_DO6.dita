Although the 2016 Amendments are disclosure-only amendments, all reporting entities will need to consider providing this disclosure. For this disclosure, an entity may be required to adjust items already presented as operating and financing activities in a statement of cash flows (for example, interest payments that are classified as operating activities), which may require system changes. Concurrently, an entity may also have to initiate system changes to prepare for applying <xref base="F68304817" href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_TOC.dita#IFRS09_TOC0001" id="IAS07_X0328"><ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 9</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Financial Instruments</ph></ph></xref> and IFRS 15 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Revenue from Contracts with Customers</ph></ph> (both effective on 1 January 2018) as well as <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 16</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Leases</ph></ph> (effective on 1 January 2019). Mr Ochi believes that the costs that will be incurred by entities as a consequence of those other changes will be considerable and he thinks that this fact is not reflected in the conclusion the Board had reached as a consequence of its assessment of costs pertaining to this disclosure. Taking these matters into consideration, Mr Ochi believes that the costs of the 2016 Amendments will outweigh the benefits.</p></body></paragraph>
