The amendments were in response to requests from users, including those received at the Board&#x2019;s <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Financial Reporting Disclosure Discussion Forum</ph></ph> in January 2013 and reflected in the resulting Feedback Statement (&#x2018;the Feedback Statement&#x2019;), which was issued in May 2013. Users highlighted that understanding an entity&#x2019;s cash flows is critical to their analysis and that there is a need for improved disclosures about an entity&#x2019;s debt, including changes in debt during the reporting period. The Feedback Statement noted that users had been consistently asking for the Board to introduce a requirement for entities to disclose and explain a net debt reconciliation.</p></body></paragraph>
