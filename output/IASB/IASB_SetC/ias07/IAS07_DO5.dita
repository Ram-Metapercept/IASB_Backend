He notes that the Board may conduct research regarding the effectiveness of IAS 7. Because he regards IAS 7 as having some significant shortcomings, he believes that issuing amendments based on the existing statement of cash flows is not a worthwhile endeavour. He also thinks that it could reduce the clarity of the statement of cash flows.</p></body></paragraph>
