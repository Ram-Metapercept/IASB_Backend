For example, an entity could provide that information as part of a net debt reconciliation, as described in paragraph BC20(b). To ensure users can identify the information required by paragraph 44A, the format selected needs to distinguish that information from information about changes in other assets and liabilities. In finalising the 2016 Amendments, the Board clarified these points in paragraph 44E.</p></body></paragraph>
