The Board noted that even though paragraphs 14 and 16 of IAS 7 appear to be clear that only expenditure that results in the recognition of an asset should be classified as cash flows from investing activities, the wording is not definitive in this respect. Some might have misinterpreted the reference in paragraph 11 of IAS 7 for an entity to assess classification by activity that is most appropriate to its business to imply that the assessment is an accounting policy choice.</p></body></paragraph>
