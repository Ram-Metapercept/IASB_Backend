Some entities classified such expenditures as cash flows from operating activities and others classified them as investing activities. Examples of such expenditures are those for exploration and evaluation activities, which <xref base="F9043139" href="../ifrs06/IFRS06_TOC.dita#IFRS06_TOC0001" id="IAS07_X0324">IFRS 6 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources</ph></ph></xref> permits to be recognised as either an asset or an expense depending on the entity&#x2019;s previous accounting policies for those expenditures. Expenditures on advertising and promotional activities, staff training, and research and development could also raise the same issue.</p></body></paragraph>
