The Board noted that there will be initial costs for preparers to update information technology systems to enable changes in liabilities arising from financing activities to be tracked and collated. The Board also acknowledged that disclosing additional information could result in costs relating to extending the existing internal controls and audit processes of the entity. However, the Board noted that much of the information is already available to preparers. It also noted that the 2016 Amendments do not change the recognition or measurement for liabilities arising from financing activities; instead, they track changes in those items. Consequently, the Board concluded that it does not foresee any significant ongoing cost related to providing this information, and that the informational benefits to users of financial statements would outweigh the costs.</p></body></paragraph>
