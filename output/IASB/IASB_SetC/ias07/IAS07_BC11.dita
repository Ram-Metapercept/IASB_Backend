The Board noted that one challenge in responding to this need was that debt is not defined or required to be disclosed in current IFRS Standards. The Board noted that finding a commonly agreed definition of debt would be difficult. However, the Board decided that it could use the definition of financing activities in IAS 7. It therefore decided to propose a requirement to disclose a reconciliation between the amounts in the opening and the amounts in the closing statements of financial position for liabilities for which cash flows were, or future cash flows will be, classified as financing activities in the statement of cash flows.</p></body></paragraph>
