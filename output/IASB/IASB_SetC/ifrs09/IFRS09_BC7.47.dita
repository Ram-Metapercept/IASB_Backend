However, consistent with its proposal in the 2010 Hedge Accounting Exposure Draft (see <xref base="F71905924" href="IFRS09_BC7.44.dita#IFRS09_BC7.44" id="IFRS09_X3218">paragraph BC7.44</xref>), the IASB decided not to allow the grandfathering of the application of IAS 39. Instead, the IASB retained its original decision that the new hedge accounting requirements are applied to hedging relationships that qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39 and this Standard and that those are treated as continuing hedging relationships.</p></body></paragraph>
