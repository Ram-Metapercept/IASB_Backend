This is similar for a group hedge approach. However, for a group hedge approach an entity seeks to manage the risk exposure from a group of items. Some of the risks in the group may offset (for their full term or for a partial term) and provide a hedge against each other, leaving the group residual risk to be hedged by the hedging instrument.</p></body></paragraph>
