Thus, if the three conditions are met and the entity passes on a fully proportional share, either of all cash flows (as in the example in <xref id="IFRS09_X2283" base="F71849480" href="IFRS09_BCZ3.15.dita#IFRS09_BCZ3.15">paragraph BCZ3.15</xref>) or of specifically identified cash flows (eg 10 per cent of all interest cash flows), the proportion sold is derecognised, provided the entity has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. Thus, in the example in paragraph BCZ3.15, Entity A would report a loan asset of CU10 and derecognise CU90. Similarly, if an entity enters into an arrangement that meets the three conditions above, but the arrangement is not on a fully proportionate basis, the contractual arrangement would have to meet the general derecognition conditions to qualify for derecognition. This ensures consistency in the application of the derecognition model, whether a transaction is structured as a transfer of the contractual right to receive the cash flows of a financial asset or as an arrangement to pass through cash flows.</p></body></paragraph>
