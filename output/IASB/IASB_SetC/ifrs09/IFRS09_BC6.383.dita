The IASB noted that a net investment in a foreign operation was determined and accounted for in accordance with <xref base="F71871850" href="../ias21/IAS21_TOC.dita#IAS21_TOC0001" id="IFRS09_X3036">IAS 21</xref>. The IASB also noted that the hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation also related to IAS 21. Hence, similar to the issue of considering intragroup monetary items for eligibility as hedging instruments for hedges of foreign exchange risk (see <xref base="F71871851" href="IFRS09_BC6.149.dita#IFRS09_BC6.149" id="IFRS09_X3037">paragraph BC6.149</xref>), the IASB considered that comprehensively addressing this type of hedge would require a review of the requirements in IAS 21 at the same time as considering the hedge accounting requirements.</p></body></paragraph>
