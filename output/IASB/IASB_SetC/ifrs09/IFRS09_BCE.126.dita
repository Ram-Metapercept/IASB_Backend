However, these estimates only use credit loss experience based on historical events to set out &#x2018;provisioning&#x2019; levels over the entire economic cycle (&#x2018;through-the-cycle&#x2019;). Furthermore, through-the-cycle approaches consider a range of possible economic outcomes instead of those that are actually expected at the reporting date. This would result in a loss allowance that is not designed to reflect the economic characteristics of the financial instruments at the reporting date. In addition, the default measures used may be adjusted to reflect a more &#x2018;conservative&#x2019; outlook instead of actual expectations.</p></body></paragraph>
