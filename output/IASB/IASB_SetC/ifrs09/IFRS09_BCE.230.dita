Under the new model, linking the hedge documentation requirements with that of risk management systems will, in the IASB&#x2019;s view, bring in efficiencies and cost savings as entities integrate such systems. In addition, the new model includes an objective-based effectiveness assessment, which is linked to the way that the hedging relationship is designed and monitored for risk management purposes. This will substantially reduce the costs of ongoing compliance compared with IAS 39.</p></body></paragraph>
