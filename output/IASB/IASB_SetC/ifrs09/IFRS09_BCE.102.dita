Some of those financial asset impairments cannot be reversed. During the global financial crisis, some users of financial statements were confused because the same financial assets were impaired differently simply because they were classified differently for accounting purposes. In contrast, under IFRS 9 the same impairment model is applied to <i>all</i> financial instruments subject to impairment accounting. This addresses the criticism that having multiple impairment models in IAS 39 is confusing.</p></body></paragraph>
