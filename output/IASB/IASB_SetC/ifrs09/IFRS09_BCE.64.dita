However, many users of financial statements confirmed that fair value information on the balance sheet does provide useful information because, for example, it can provide early information about an entity&#x2019;s credit problems. The IASB thus decided that entities should continue to have the ability to measure their non-derivative liabilities at fair value (subject to the relevant criteria that are unchanged from <xref base="F71918672" href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001/IAS39_TOC0001_V3" id="IFRS09_X3293">IAS 39</xref>), but that the portion of the fair value change that is a consequence of changes in the financial instrument&#x2019;s credit risk should be recognised in other comprehensive income. The result of the IASB&#x2019;s decisions, including the own credit requirements for financial liabilities described in <xref base="F71918712" href="IFRS09_gBC5.35-BC5.64.dita#IFRS09_gBC5.35-BC5.64/IFRS09_gBC5.35-BC5.64_TI" id="IFRS09_X3294">paragraphs BC5.35&#x2013;BC5.64</xref>, result in information being reported for financial liabilities that is more useful in assessing the amounts, timing and uncertainty of the entity&#x2019;s future cash flows.</p></body></paragraph>
