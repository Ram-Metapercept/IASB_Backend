However, a few respondents expressed disagreement with the proposal on the basis that they disagreed with the IASB&#x2019;s conclusion that hedge accounting would be required to be discontinued as a result of such novations. In expressing such disagreement some noted that the guidance on the discontinuation of hedge accounting expressly acknowledges that certain replacements or rollovers of hedging instruments are not expirations or terminations for the purposes of discontinuing hedge accounting. The IASB noted that this exception applies if &#x201C;[a] replacement or rollover is part of, and consistent with, the entity&#x2019;s documented risk management objective&#x201D;. The IASB questioned whether replacement of a contract as a result of unforeseen legislative changes (even if documented) fits the definition of a replacement that is part of a &#x2018;documented risk management objective&#x2019;.</p></body></paragraph>
