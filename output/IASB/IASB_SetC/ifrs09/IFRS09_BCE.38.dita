The IASB considered specific requirements relating to that transfer, such as requiring the accumulated gain or loss to be transferred to retained earnings upon derecognition of the equity investment, but did not adopt such an approach because of jurisdiction-specific restrictions on components of equity. For example, a transfer to retained earnings may give rise to tax consequences in some jurisdictions. However, additional disclosures are required about investments in equity instruments with fair value changes presented in other comprehensive income to provide useful information to users of financial statements about the effect of that presentation for instruments presented in that manner. For example, <xref id="IFRS09_X3280" base="F71918627" href="../ifrs07/IFRS07_11B.dita#IFRS07_11B/IFRS07_11B_V1">paragraph 11B of IFRS 7</xref> requires an entity to disclose the cumulative gain or loss on disposal if the entity derecognised investments in equity instruments with fair value changes presented in other comprehensive income during the reporting period.</p></body></paragraph>
