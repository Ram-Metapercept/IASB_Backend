In order to protect themselves against the downside of an exposure (an adverse outcome) while retaining the upside, they have to compensate someone else for assuming the inverse asymmetrical position, which has only the downside but not the upside. The time value of an option is subject to &#x2018;time decay&#x2019;. This means that it loses its value over time as the option approaches expiry, which occurs at an increasingly rapid rate. At expiry the option&#x2019;s time value reaches zero. Hence, entities that use purchased options to hedge one-sided risks know that over the life of the option they will lose the time value that they paid. This explains why entities typically view the premium paid as being similar to an insurance premium and hence as a cost of using this hedging strategy.</p></body></paragraph>
