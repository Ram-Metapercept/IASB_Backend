As noted in       paragraph BC6.566, in the IASB&#x2019;s view, an offset between the hedged item and the hedging       instrument is a fundamental principle of the hedge accounting model in <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 9</ph></ph> and, therefore,       the IASB considered reliable measurement of the hedged item and the hedging instrument to be       critical to maintain this principle.</p></body></paragraph>
