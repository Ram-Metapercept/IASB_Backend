That eligibility condition would have required that the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant when the entity initially recognises the financial asset. The objective of that proposed eligibility condition was to limit further the scope of the amendments so that financial assets would be eligible to be measured at amortised cost only if it is unlikely that prepayment, and thus negative compensation, would occur.</p></body></paragraph>
