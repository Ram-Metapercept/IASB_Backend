The exception addresses only the uncertainties arising       from the reform. Therefore, if an entity is unable to demonstrate the existence of an economic       relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument for other reasons, the entity       shall discontinue hedge accounting as required by <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 9</ph></ph>.</p></body></paragraph>
