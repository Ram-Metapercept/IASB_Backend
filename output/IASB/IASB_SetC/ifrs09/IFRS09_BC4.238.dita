For example, that could be the case if the compensation structure of the prepayment feature is symmetrical so that the effect of reasonable negative compensation on that feature&#x2019;s fair value is offset by the effect of reasonable additional compensation (as accommodated by paragraph B4.1.11(b) of IFRS 9 (as issued in 2014)), or if the prepayment amount is close to the instrument&#x2019;s fair value at the prepayment date.</p></body></paragraph>
