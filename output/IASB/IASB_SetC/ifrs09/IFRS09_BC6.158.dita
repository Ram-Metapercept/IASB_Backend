As the sole exception, <xref base="F71859432" href="../ias39/IAS39_gAG94-AG97.dita#IAS39_gAG94-AG97/IAS39_gAG94-AG97_TI" id="IFRS09_X2917">paragraph AG94 in the application guidance in IAS 39</xref> allowed a purchased option to be designated as a hedged item. In practice, this has generally prevented derivatives from qualifying as hedged items. Similarly, positions that are a combination of an exposure and a derivative (&#x2018;aggregated exposures&#x2019;) failed to qualify as hedged items. The implementation guidance accompanying IAS 39 provided the rationale for not permitting derivatives (or aggregated exposures that include a derivative) to be designated as hedged items. It stated that derivative instruments were always deemed to be held for trading and measured at fair value with gains or losses recognised in profit or loss unless they are designated as hedging instruments.</p></body></paragraph>
