Commentators noted that it is not useful to report lower liabilities when an entity is in financial difficulty precisely because its debt levels are too high, and that it would be difficult to explain to users of financial statements                     the reasons why income would be recognised when a liability&#x2019;s creditworthiness deteriorates. These comments suggested that fair value should exclude the effects of changes in the instrument&#x2019;s credit risk.</p></body></paragraph>
