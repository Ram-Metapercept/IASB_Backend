That is because the fair value of the prepayment feature would take into account the likelihood that prepayment will occur. Accordingly, if it is very unlikely that prepayment will occur, then the fair value of the prepayment feature will be insignificant. The IASB also reconfirmed its view that the scope of the amendments must be limited to financial assets for which the effective interest method, and thus amortised cost, can provide useful information, and observed that a second eligibility condition would be helpful to precisely identify the relevant population.</p></body></paragraph>
