For example, these respondents said that some existing interest rate benchmarks prevalent in their jurisdictions are not&#x2014;at least in the near future&#x2014;being discontinued. Nonetheless, entities are expected to transition to alternative benchmark rates because, for example, they anticipate reduced liquidity for the existing benchmark or want to align with global market developments. In response, the IASB noted that the practical expedient is not limited to only particular ways of effecting the reform, provided the reform is consistent with the description in <xref href="IFRS09_6.8.2.dita">paragraph 6.8.2 of IFRS 9</xref>. The IASB also noted that the Phase 2 amendments encompass changes that are required to implement the reform&#x2014;or, in other words, changes that are necessary as a direct consequence of the reform&#x2014;even if the reform itself is not mandatory.</p></body></paragraph>
