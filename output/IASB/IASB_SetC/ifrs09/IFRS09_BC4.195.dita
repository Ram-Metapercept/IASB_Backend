However, the IASB noted that its rationale for the exception described in <xref id="IFRS09_X2536" base="F71850682" href="IFRS09_BC4.192.dita#IFRS09_BC4.192">paragraph BC4.192</xref> is equally relevant for assets that are originated or purchased at a <i>premium</i> and therefore decided that the exception should apply symmetrically to both circumstances.</p></body></paragraph>
