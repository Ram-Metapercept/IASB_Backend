Some respondents stated that reclassifications should be reflected in the entity&#x2019;s financial statements as soon as the entity&#x2019;s business model for the relevant instruments changes. To do otherwise would be contradictory to the objective of reclassification&#x2014;ie to reflect how the instruments are managed. However, the IASB decided that reclassifications should take effect from the beginning of the following reporting period. In the IASB&#x2019;s view, entities should be prevented from choosing a reclassification date to achieve an accounting result. The IASB also noted that a change in an entity&#x2019;s business model is a significant and demonstrable event; therefore, an entity will most likely disclose such an event in its financial statements in the reporting period in which the change in business model takes place.</p></body></paragraph>
