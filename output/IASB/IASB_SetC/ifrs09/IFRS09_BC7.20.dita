They proposed an approach similar to that used on first-time adoption of IFRS and when entities adopted <xref base="F71888197" href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001/IAS39_TOC0001_V3" id="IFRS09_X3168">IAS 39</xref> in 2005, in which the requirement to provide comparative information was waived. Some respondents believe that such an approach would address the concerns that, although <xref base="F71888198" href="../ias01/IAS01_TOC.dita#IAS01_TOC0001" id="IFRS09_X3169">IAS 1</xref> requires only one year of comparative information, the legal and regulatory frameworks in many jurisdictions require further comparative periods to be presented. In those situations, the restatement of comparatives would be virtually impossible for an entity wishing to adopt IFRS 9 early.</p></body></paragraph>
