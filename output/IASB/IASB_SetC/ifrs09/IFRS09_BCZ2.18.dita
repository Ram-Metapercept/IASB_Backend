The IASB concluded that the amendments should make them consistent on the basis of the notion that a contract to buy or sell a non-financial item should be accounted for as a derivative when it (i) can be settled net or by exchanging financial instruments and (ii) is not held for the purpose of receipt or delivery of the non-financial item in accordance with the entity&#x2019;s expected purchase, sale or usage requirements (a &#x2018;normal&#x2019; purchase or sale). In addition, the IASB concluded that the notion of when a contract can be settled net should include contracts:</p><ol base="F33203898" id="IFRS09_L0214" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>         <p base="F33203916" id="IFRS09_P5459">where the entity has a practice of settling similar contracts net in cash or another financial instrument or by exchanging financial instruments;</p>       </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>         <p base="F33203918" id="IFRS09_P5460">for which the entity has a practice of taking delivery of the underlying and selling it within a short period after delivery for the purpose of generating a profit from short-term fluctuations in price or dealer&#x2019;s margin; and</p>       </li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value>         <p base="F33203920" id="IFRS09_P5461">in which the non-financial item that is the subject of the contract is readily convertible to cash.</p>       </li></ol><p base="F33203921" id="IFRS09_P5462">Because practices of settling net or taking delivery of the underlying and selling it within a short period after delivery also indicate that the contracts are not &#x2018;normal&#x2019; purchases or sales, such contracts are within the scope of IAS 39 and are accounted for as derivatives. The IASB also decided to clarify that a written option that can be settled net in cash or another financial instrument, or by exchanging financial instruments, is within the scope of the Standard and cannot qualify as a &#x2018;normal&#x2019; purchase or sale.            </p></body></paragraph>
