Developing a comprehensive list of changes required by the reform&#x2014;and, hence, that qualify for the practical expedient&#x2014;would not be feasible. Nonetheless, the IASB decided to include in <xref href="IFRS09_5.4.8.dita">paragraph 5.4.8 of IFRS 9</xref> some examples of changes that give rise to a new basis for determining the contractual cash flows that is economically equivalent to the previous basis. If an entity makes only the changes specified in paragraph 5.4.8 of IFRS 9, the entity would not be required to analyse these changes further to conclude that the changes meet the condition in <xref href="IFRS09_5.4.7.dita">paragraph 5.4.7(b) of IFRS 9</xref>&#x2014;ie the changes in paragraph 5.4.8 of IFRS 9 are examples of changes that satisfy that condition. The IASB concluded that adding such examples would assist entities in understanding and applying the amendments. These examples are not exhaustive.</p></body></paragraph>
