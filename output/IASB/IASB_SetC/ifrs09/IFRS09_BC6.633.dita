Therefore, in applying <xref href="IFRS09_6.5.11.dita" scope="local">paragraph 6.5.11(d) of IFRS 9</xref>, the amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve would be reclassified to profit or loss in the same period(s) during which the hedged cash flows based on the alternative benchmark rate affect profit or loss.</p></body></paragraph>
