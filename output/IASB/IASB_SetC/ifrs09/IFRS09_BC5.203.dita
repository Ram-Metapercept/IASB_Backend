Recognising a greater portion would further increase the overstatement of expected credit losses and, thus, when considered with the much earlier timing of the recognition of lifetime expected credit losses, would be a less faithful representation of the underlying economics.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P6307" base="F33209440">12-month expected credit losses would allow preparers to make use of existing reporting systems that some regulated financial institutions already apply and would therefore be less costly to implement for those entities.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
