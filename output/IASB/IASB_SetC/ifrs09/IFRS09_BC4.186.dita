Some of these respondents were specifically concerned about contingently convertible instruments or so&#x2011;called &#x2018;bail&#x2011;in&#x2019; instruments. While the contractual terms of these instruments vary, generally, interested parties raised concerns about contingently convertible instruments that convert into equity instruments of the issuer on the basis of a predetermined ratio if a specified event occurs (for example, if the issuer&#x2019;s regulatory capital ratios decline below a specific threshold). In the case of a bail&#x2011;in instrument, interested parties generally raised concerns about instruments with a contractual feature that requires (or permits) a portion or all of the unpaid amounts of principal and interest to be written off if a specified event occurs (for example, if the issuer has insufficient regulatory capital or is at a point of non&#x2011;viability). These respondents expressed the view that these instruments should not be measured at fair value through profit or loss merely as a result of the contingent cash flow characteristics (ie the conversion into a predetermined number of the issuer&#x2019;s equity instruments or the write&#x2011;off of particular unpaid amounts upon the occurrence of a particular future event) if it is unlikely that the future event will occur.</p></body></paragraph>
