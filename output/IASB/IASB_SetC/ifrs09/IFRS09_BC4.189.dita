In other words, a financial asset must be measured at fair value through profit or loss if a remote (but genuine) contingency would result in contractual cash flows that are not solely payments of principal and interest (and those contractual cash flows are not de minimis). In reaching that conclusion, the IASB considered an alternative approach in which a contingent feature would not affect the classification and measurement of a financial asset if the likelihood is remote that the future event will occur. The IASB rejected this approach because it is inconsistent with its long&#x2011;standing view that amortised cost provides relevant and useful information only for financial assets with simple contractual cash flows. As noted in <xref id="IFRS09_X2531" base="F71850680" href="IFRS09_BC4.23.dita#IFRS09_BC4.23">paragraph BC4.23</xref>, the effective interest method is not appropriate for measuring contractual cash flows that are not solely payments of principal and interest, but instead those cash flows require a valuation overlay to contractual cash flows (ie fair value) to ensure that the reported financial information is relevant and useful.</p></body></paragraph>
