The Exposure Draft <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation</ph></ph> (Proposed amendments to IFRS 9) (2017 Negative Compensation Exposure Draft) proposed that such financial assets would be eligible to be measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income, subject to an assessment of the business model in which they are held, if two eligibility conditions are met.</p></body></paragraph>
