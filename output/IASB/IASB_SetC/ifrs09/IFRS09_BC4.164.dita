The IASB acknowledged that there might be some benefits in making fair value through other comprehensive income the residual measurement category, because, arguably, a clearer distinction could be made between the conditions for the amortised cost measurement category and the conditions for the fair value through profit or loss measurement category. That is, it would be easier to define the two &#x2018;ends&#x2019; of the classification spectrum (ie amortised cost and fair value through profit or loss) with the &#x2018;middle&#x2019; (ie fair value through other comprehensive income) as the residual. As noted in <xref id="IFRS09_X2508" base="F71850568" href="IFRS09_BC4.156.dita#IFRS09_BC4.156">paragraph BC4.156</xref>, a few respondents to the 2012 Limited Amendments Exposure Draft expressed this view.</p></body></paragraph>
