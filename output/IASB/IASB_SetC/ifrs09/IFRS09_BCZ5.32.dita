The IASB decided that whilst separately presenting or disclosing such changes might be difficult in practice, disclosure of such information would be useful to users of financial statements and would help alleviate the concerns expressed. Consequently, it decided to require a disclosure to help identify the changes in the fair value of a financial liability that arise from changes in the liability&#x2019;s credit risk. The IASB believes this is a reasonable proxy for the change in fair value that is attributable to changes in the liability&#x2019;s credit risk, in particular when such changes are large, and will provide users with information with which to understand the profit or loss effect of such a change in credit risk.</p></body></paragraph>
