Nevertheless, this estimate is necessary to have a consistent application of the impairment model. The IASB considered that not having it would defeat the purpose of removing the inconsistency between on balance sheet and off balance sheet exposures. Consequently, the IASB decided that for financial instruments that include both a loan and an undrawn commitment component and the entity&#x2019;s contractual ability to demand repayment and cancel the undrawn commitment does not limit the entity&#x2019;s exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period, an entity shall estimate the usage behaviour over the period that the entity is exposed to credit risk and expected credit losses would not be mitigated by credit risk management actions, even if that period extends beyond the maximum contractual period (see <xref id="IFRS09_X2823" base="F71859055" href="IFRS09_BC5.254.dita#IFRS09_BC5.254">paragraphs BC5.254&#x2013;BC5.261</xref>) .</p></body></paragraph>
