That is because these amendments would apply only when the conditions in <xref href="IFRS09_5.4.7.dita" scope="local">paragraph 5.4.7 of IFRS 9</xref> are met, which require that changes are made on an economically equivalent basis. The IASB acknowledged these comments noting that, applying <xref href="IFRS09_6.9.1.dita" scope="local">paragraph 6.9.1 of IFRS 9</xref>, a significant change in fair value arising from the remeasurement of the hedged item or the hedging instrument indicates that the changes were not made on an economically equivalent basis. Furthermore, the IASB observed that the requirement in paragraph 6.9.1(b) of IFRS 9, which requires the description of the designated portion for the cash flows or fair value being hedged enables entities to amend a hedging relationship to minimise fair value changes on the remeasurement of the hedged item or the hedging instrument.</p></body></paragraph>
