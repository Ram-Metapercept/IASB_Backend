In accordance with a decoupled approach, an entity would calculate the interest revenue by multiplying the effective interest rate by the gross carrying amount (ie the amount that does not include an adjustment for the loss allowance). As a result, not adjusting the carrying amount upon a modification would result in inflating interest revenue and the loss allowance.</p></body></paragraph>
