However, the IASB concluded that the fair value option could be applied to any financial liability, and decided not to restrict the option in IAS 39 (as revised in 2003) because to do so would negate some of the benefits of the fair value option set out in <xref base="F71854662" href="IFRS09_BCZ4.60.dita#IFRS09_BCZ4.60" id="IFRS09_X2631">paragraph BCZ4.60</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
