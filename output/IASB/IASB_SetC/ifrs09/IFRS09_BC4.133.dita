Most of the decisions were made jointly and there was general agreement on the key aspects. However, there were differences in the boards&#x2019; decisions on specific details, such as the assessment of some contingent and prepayment features as well as the articulation of particular aspects of the business model assessment.</p></body></paragraph>
