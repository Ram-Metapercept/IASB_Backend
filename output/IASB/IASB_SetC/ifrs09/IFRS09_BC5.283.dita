The IASB expects entities to be able to use some regulatory measures as a basis for the calculation of expected credit losses in accordance with the requirements in IFRS 9. However, these calculations may have to be adjusted to meet the measurement requirements in <xref id="IFRS09_X2852" base="F71859182" href="IFRS09_g5.5.1-5.5.20.dita#IFRS09_g5.5.1-5.5.20/IFRS09_g5.5.1-5.5.20_TI">Section 5.5 of IFRS 9</xref>. Only information that is available without undue cost or effort and supportable at the reporting date should be considered. This may include information about current economic conditions as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, as long as the information is supportable and available without undue cost or effort when the estimates are made.</p></body></paragraph>
