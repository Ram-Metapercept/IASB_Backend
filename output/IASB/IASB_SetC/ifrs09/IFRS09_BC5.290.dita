The IASB observed that for information about the effects of the transition to alternative benchmark rates to be useful, the information has to be relevant to users of financial statements and faithfully represent the economic effects of that transition on the entity. This objective assisted the IASB in assessing whether it should amend IFRS Standards or whether the requirements in IFRS Standards already provided an adequate basis to account for such effects.</p></body></paragraph>
