The 2009 Impairment Exposure Draft proposed a model in which an entity would have considered initial expectations of credit losses when determining the effective interest rate on financial assets. Consequently, interest revenue would have represented the economic yield, or the effective return, on those financial assets. In contrast, the decoupled approach in IFRS 9 considers the recognition of interest revenue and the recognition of expected credit losses separately. Under this approach, an entity recognises interest on the gross carrying amount of a financial asset without taking expected credit losses into consideration (except when financial assets become credit&#x2011;impaired or are credit&#x2011;impaired on initial recognition). <xref id="IFRS09_X2680" base="F71854861" href="IFRS09_BC5.85.dita#IFRS09_BC5.85">Paragraphs BC5.88&#x2013;BC5.91</xref> discusses further the reasons why the IASB did not proceed with the proposals in the 2009 Impairment Exposure Draft in finalising IFRS 9.</p></body></paragraph>
