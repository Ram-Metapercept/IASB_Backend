The Board agreed with the concern that the fair value of a prepayment feature would reflect not only the probability that reasonable negative compensation will occur, but it would also reflect the probability that reasonable additional compensation (as accommodated by paragraph B4.1.11(b) of IFRS 9 (as issued in 2014)) will occur. In some circumstances, the fair value of the prepayment feature may be more than insignificant due largely, or entirely, to the latter. In such circumstances, the financial asset would not meet the second eligibility condition even if the holder determined that it was very unlikely that negative compensation will occur.</p></body></paragraph>
