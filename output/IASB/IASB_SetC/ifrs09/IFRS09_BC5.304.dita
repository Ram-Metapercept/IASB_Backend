Applying that paragraph, a modification gain or loss is determined by recalculating the gross carrying amount of the financial asset as the present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows that are discounted at the financial asset&#x2019;s original effective interest rate. Any resulting modification gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss at the date of the modification. The accounting for other revisions in estimated future contractual cash flows, including modifications of financial liabilities that do not result in the derecognition of those liabilities (see <xref href="IFRS09_B5.4.6.dita">paragraph B5.4.6 of IFRS 9</xref>), is consistent with the accounting for modified financial assets that do not result in derecognition.<xref type="fn" keyref="footnotes/IFRS09_BC5.304_FN0001"/></p></body></paragraph>
