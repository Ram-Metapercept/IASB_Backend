However if a contractual term is not genuine, it does not affect the classification of a financial asset. (Consistently with <xref base="F71850679" href="../ias32/IAS32_TOC.dita#IAS32_TOC0001/IAS32_TOC0001_V2" id="IFRS09_X2530">IAS 32</xref>, a contractual feature is not genuine if it affects the asset&#x2019;s contractual cash flows only on the occurrence of an event that is extremely rare, highly abnormal and very unlikely to occur.)</p></body></paragraph>
