In particular, investments will be required in substantial system changes. The ongoing costs will be mitigated by the fact that several simplifications and clarifications have been put in place that reduce the operational burden of the impairment model in IFRS 9 (see <xref id="IFRS09_X3314" base="F71918816" href="IFRS09_gBCE.151-BCE.151.dita#IFRS09_gBCE.151-BCE.151/IFRS09_gBCE.151-BCE.151_TI">paragraphs BCE.151&#x2013;BCE.164</xref>). The IASB&#x2019;s assessment is that the significant improvements in terms of timeliness of information about expected credit losses and transparency will outweigh those costs.</p></body></paragraph>
