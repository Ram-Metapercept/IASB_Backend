For example, if the outcome of the reform affects the market structure of an interest rate benchmark, it could affect an entity&#x2019;s assessment of whether a non-contractually specified LIBOR component is separately identifiable and, therefore, an eligible hedged item in a hedging relationship. The IASB considered only risk components that are implicit in the fair value or the cash flows of an item of which they are a part (referred to as non-contractually specified) because the same issue does not arise for risk components that are explicitly specified in the contract.</p></body></paragraph>
