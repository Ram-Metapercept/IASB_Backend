The IASB therefore provided no exceptions from the assessment of the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument for the period after the Phase 1 exception in <xref href="IFRS09_6.8.6.dita" scope="local">paragraph 6.8.6 of IFRS 9</xref> ceases to apply.</p></body></paragraph>
