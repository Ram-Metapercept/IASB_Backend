For example, consider an entity that holds a fixed-rate bond and the benchmark interest rate decreases but the bond&#x2019;s spread over the benchmark increases. If the entity hedges only the benchmark interest rate using a benchmark interest rate swap, the loss on the swap is offset by a fair value hedge adjustment for the benchmark interest rate component of the bond (even though the bond&#x2019;s fair value is lower than its carrying amount after the fair value hedge adjustment because of the increase in the spread).</p></body></paragraph>
