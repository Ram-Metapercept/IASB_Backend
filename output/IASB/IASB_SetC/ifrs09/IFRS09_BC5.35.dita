However, many users                     and others told the IASB over a long period of time that changes in a liability&#x2019;s credit risk ought not to affect profit or loss unless the liability is held for trading. That is because an entity generally will not realise the effects of changes in the liability&#x2019;s credit risk unless the liability is held for trading.</p></body></paragraph>
