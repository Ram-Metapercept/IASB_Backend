However, the IASB did not want to create an &#x2018;artificial&#x2019; disincentive for entities to lend to customers with higher credit risk. Furthermore, the IASB believes that full lifetime expected credit losses should not be recognised on initial recognition irrespective of the initial credit risk because financial instruments are priced reflecting initial credit risk expectations. In particular, the IASB was concerned about the effect on the balance sheet carrying amount at initial recognition that would result if lifetime expected credit losses were recognised from inception.</p></body></paragraph>
