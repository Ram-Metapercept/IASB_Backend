An entity will recognise changes in the initial expected credit losses as gains or losses. <xref base="F71858842" href="IFRS09_BC5.89.dita#IFRS09_BC5.89" id="IFRS09_X2781">Paragraph BC5.89</xref> sets out the operational challenges that would have arisen if the 2009 Impairment Exposure Draft had applied to all financial assets. However, in developing the proposals in the 2013 Impairment Exposure Draft, the IASB observed that this requirement in IAS 39 has not presented issues in practice and proposed to retain it, and to use a scope that is based on <xref base="F71858841" href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001/IAS39_TOC0001_V3" id="IFRS09_X2782">IAS 39</xref> to minimise the operational challenges for preparers.</p></body></paragraph>
