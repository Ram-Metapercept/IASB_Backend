Similarly, if an entity amends the hedge designation to make a change other than the changes described in <xref href="IFRS09_6.9.1.dita" scope="local">paragraph 6.9.1 of IFRS 9</xref> (for example, if it extends the term of the hedging relationship), the entity would first determine if those additional changes to the hedge designation result in the discontinuation of hedge accounting. If the additional changes do not result in the discontinuation of hedge accounting, the designation of the hedging relationship would be amended as required by paragraph 6.9.1 of IFRS 9.</p></body></paragraph>
