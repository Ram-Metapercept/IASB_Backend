They argued that in scenarios in which there are other items that are managed within a fair value-based risk management strategy and those other items are not measured at fair value under IFRS, applying derivative accounting to &#x2018;own use contracts&#x2019; would introduce (instead of eliminate) an accounting mismatch. For example, in the electricity industry the risk management for some power plants and the related electricity sales is on a fair value basis. If these entities had to apply derivative accounting for customer sales contracts it would create an accounting mismatch. This accounting mismatch would result in artificial profit or loss volatility if the power plant is measured at cost under <xref base="F71849187" href="../ias16/IAS16_TOC.dita#IAS16_TOC0001/IAS16_TOC0001_V2" id="IFRS09_X2241"><ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 16</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Property, Plant and Equipment</ph></ph></xref>. Another example raised by respondents was that of entities risk-managing the own use contracts, inventory and derivatives on a fair value basis. An accounting mismatch would arise if the inventory is measured in accordance with <xref base="F71849188" href="../ias02/IAS02_TOC0001.dita#IAS02_TOC0001" id="IFRS09_X2242"><ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 2</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Inventories</ph></ph></xref> at the lower of cost and net realisable value while the own use contracts are measured at fair value.</p></body></paragraph>
