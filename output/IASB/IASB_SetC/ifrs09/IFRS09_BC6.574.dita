In the IASB&#x2019;s view, allowing hedge accounting for risk components that are not       separately identifiable at the inception would be inconsistent with the objective of the       exception. The IASB noted that such circumstances are different from allowing continued       designation as the hedged item for risk components that had met the requirement at the       inception of the hedging relationship.</p></body></paragraph>
