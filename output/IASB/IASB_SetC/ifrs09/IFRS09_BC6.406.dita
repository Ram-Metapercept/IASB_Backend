However, the IASB noted that a single accounting treatment would be inconsistent with other Standards because it would not distinguish situations in a similar way (see <xref id="IFRS09_X3048" base="F71871926" href="IFRS09_BC6.391.dita#IFRS09_BC6.391">paragraphs BC6.391&#x2013;BC6.392</xref>). Hence, the IASB considered that the suggested single accounting treatment would essentially treat unlike situations as alike. The IASB noted that this would actually diminish comparability and hence not be an improvement to financial reporting.</p></body></paragraph>
