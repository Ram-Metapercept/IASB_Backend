The IASB considered this concern and agreed that the words in that Exposure Draft did not reflect the IASB&#x2019;s intention. Thus, the IASB clarified that if an entity has a past practice of selling the assets resulting from its loan commitments shortly after origination, it applies IAS 39 only to its loan commitments in the same class.</p></body></paragraph>
