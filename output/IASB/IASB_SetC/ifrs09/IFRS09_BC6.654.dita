For each new hedge designation, an entity is required to assess whether the qualifying criteria to apply hedge accounting, including the separately identifiable requirement, have been met. However, the IASB also considered that applying the 24-month period to different hedging relationships (with the same alternative benchmark rate designated as a risk component) at different times could add an unnecessary operational burden as the period would end at different times and thus would need to be monitored over different periods, for different hedging relationships. For example, if an entity designates the alternative benchmark rate as the risk component in two hedging relationships&#x2014;the first designated on 31 March 20X1 and the second on 30 June 20X1&#x2014;the 24-month period for each hedge would begin and end at different dates, although the designated risk is the same in both hedging relationships.</p></body></paragraph>
