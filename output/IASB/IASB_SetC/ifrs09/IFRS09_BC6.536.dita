Hence, in contrast to the insurance approach (see <xref id="IFRS09_X3108" base="F71882643" href="IFRS09_gBC6.528-BC6.534.dita#IFRS09_gBC6.528-BC6.534/IFRS09_gBC6.528-BC6.534_TI">paragraphs BC6.528&#x2013;BC6.534</xref>), an advantage of this approach would be that the accounting for the credit default swap would not be affected by any switches between periods for which the credit derivative is used and those for which it is not used to manage a particular credit exposure.</p></body></paragraph>
