For example, an entity that issues a 5-year floating-rate debt instrument that bears interest at 3-month LIBOR + 1%, could designate as the hedged item either the entire debt instrument (that is, all of the cash flows) or only the 3-month LIBOR risk component of the floating-rate debt instrument. Specifically, <xref href="IFRS09_6.3.7.dita">paragraph 6.3.7(a) of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 9</ph></ph></xref> allows entities to designate only changes in the cash flows or fair value of an item attributable to a specific risk or risks (risk component) provided that the risk component is separately identifiable and reliably measurable.</p></body></paragraph>
