The effect of such additional changes to the formal hedge designation on the application of the hedge accounting requirements would depend on whether those changes result in the derecognition of the underlying financial instrument (see <xref href="IFRS09_5.4.9.dita" scope="local">paragraph 5.4.9 of IFRS 9</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
