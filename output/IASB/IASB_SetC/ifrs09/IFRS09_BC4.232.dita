The IASB is also aware that some financial assets are prepayable at an amount that includes the fair value cost to terminate an associated hedging instrument (which may or may not be in a hedging relationship with the prepayable financial asset for accounting purposes). Some interested parties suggested that both of those types of prepayable financial asset should be eligible for amortised cost measurement. The IASB acknowledged that there may be some circumstances in which such a contractual prepayment feature results in contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest in accordance with IFRS 9, as amended; ie there may be circumstances in which the compensation included in such a prepayment amount is reasonable for the early termination of the contract. For example, that may be the case when the calculation of the prepayment amount is intended to approximate unpaid amounts of principal and interest plus or minus an amount that reflects the effect of the change in the relevant benchmark interest rate. However, the Board observed that it will not always be the case and therefore an entity cannot presume that all such prepayable financial assets are eligible to be measured at amortised cost. Entities must assess an instrument&#x2019;s specific contractual cash flow characteristics.</p></body></paragraph>
