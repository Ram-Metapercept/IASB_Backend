In this case, should (a) the entire portfolio continue to be recognised, (b) the portion that is guaranteed continue to be recognised or (c) the portfolio be derecognised in full and a guarantee be recognised as a financial liability? The original <xref base="F71849319" href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001/IAS39_TOC0001_V3" id="IFRS09_X2258">IAS 39</xref> did not give a clear answer and the IAS 39 Implementation Guidance Committee&#x2014;a group set up by the IASB&#x2019;s predecessor body to resolve interpretative issues raised in practice&#x2014;was unable to reach an agreement on how IAS 39 should be applied in this case. In developing proposals for improvements to IAS 39, the IASB concluded that it was important that IAS 39 should provide clear and consistent guidance on how to account for such a transaction.</p></body></paragraph>
