<paragraph id="IFRS09_BC6.595"><paranum>BC6.595</paranum><prolog><data name="standard_number" value="IFRS 9 BC"/></prolog><body><p>The IASB observed that continuing to apply the exception after the uncertainty was resolved would not faithfully represent the actual characteristics of the elements of the hedging relationship in which the uncertainty arising from the reform is eliminated. The IASB considered whether it should extend the relief provided such that the exceptions would apply at the hedging relationship level for as long as any element of that hedging relationship was affected by the uncertainties arising from the reform. The IASB agreed that doing so would be beyond the objective of addressing only those issues directly affected by the uncertainty arising from the reform. This is also because the exceptions in <xref href="IFRS09_g6.8.4-6.8.4.dita">paragraphs 6.8.4&#x2013;6.8.12 of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 9</ph></ph></xref> and the respective requirements in <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 9</ph></ph> apply to the same elements of the hedging relationship. Therefore, applying each exception at the hedging relationship level would be inconsistent with how the underlying requirements are applied.</p></body></paragraph>
