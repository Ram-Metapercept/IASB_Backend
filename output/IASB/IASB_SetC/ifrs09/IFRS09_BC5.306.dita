In reaching this view, the IASB considered a situation in which a financial instrument was amended only to replace an interest rate benchmark with an alternative benchmark rate. Using the interest rate benchmark-based effective interest rate to calculate interest revenue or interest expense over the remaining life in this situation would not reflect the economic effects of the modified financial instrument. Maintaining the original effective interest rate could also be difficult, and perhaps impossible, if that rate is no longer available.</p></body></paragraph>
