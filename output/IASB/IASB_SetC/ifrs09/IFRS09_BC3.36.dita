An entity that has not previously applied any version of IFRS 9 and whose activities are predominantly connected with insurance is permitted to apply <xref href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita">IAS 39</xref> for a limited period of time. In providing the temporary exemption from applying IFRS 9, the Board had not contemplated maintaining IAS 39 (other than for hedge accounting) given the temporary and limited nature of the exemption. Therefore, the Board did not amend paragraph AG62 of IAS 39.</p></body></paragraph>
