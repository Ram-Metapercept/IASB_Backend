Accordingly, the first eligibility condition proposed in the Exposure Draft was intended to identify those prepayment features that do not introduce any contractual cash flow amounts that are different from the cash flow amounts accommodated by paragraph B4.1.11(b) of IFRS 9 (as issued in 2014).</p></body></paragraph>
