The IASB noted that not all debt instruments acquired in an active market are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. In accordance with <xref id="IFRS09_X2711" base="F71856756" href="IFRS09_4.1.2.dita#IFRS09_4.1.2">paragraph 4.1.2 of IFRS 9</xref>, such instruments can also be measured at amortised cost if the business model criteria are met (subject to the cash flow characteristics criteria). Having separate impairment models for similar financial assets that are measured differently would be inconsistent with the IASB&#x2019;s objective of having a single impairment model.</p></body></paragraph>
