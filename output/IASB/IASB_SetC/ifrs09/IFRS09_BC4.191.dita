The IASB noted that IFRS 9 requires the holder to analyse the <i>contractual terms</i> of a financial asset to determine whether the asset gives rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. In other words, the holder would not consider the payments that arise only as a result of the government&#x2019;s or other authority&#x2019;s legislative power as cash flows in its analysis. That is because that power and the related payments are not <i>contractual terms</i> of the financial instrument.</p></body></paragraph>
