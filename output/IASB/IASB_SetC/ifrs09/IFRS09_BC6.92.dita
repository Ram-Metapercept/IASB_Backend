It also applies to all types of hedges and risks. But entities must use the designations that are available under the new hedge accounting model (and can only apply hedge accounting if they meet the qualifying criteria).</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p base="F33206428" id="IFRS09_P6463">the new hedge accounting model does not however provide specific &#x2018;customised&#x2019; solutions that would be an exception to (instead of an application of) the model designed to make the implementation of hedge accounting in those situations easier. For example, it does not provide an exception to allow a net position cash flow hedge for interest rate risk or to allow non-interest bearing demand deposits to be designated as hedged items.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p base="F33206430" id="IFRS09_P6464">the specific fair value hedge accounting for a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk is an exception to the hedge accounting model in <xref base="F71859224" href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001/IAS39_TOC0001_V3" id="IFRS09_X2863">IAS 39</xref> and is strictly limited to that particular type of hedge. This exception does not fit into the new hedge accounting model. The IASB decided that in order to retain this exception pending the completion of the project on accounting for macro hedging, a scope exception that allows the continued application of IAS 39 for this particular type of hedge is appropriate.</p></li><li><li_value>(d)</li_value> <p base="F33206432" id="IFRS09_P6465">in contrast, cash flow hedge accounting in a &#x2018;macro&#x2019; context was an application of the (general) hedge accounting model under IAS 39. Consequently, it is consistent with that approach to include &#x2018;macro cash flow hedge accounting&#x2019; as an application of the new hedge accounting model.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
