The IASB agreed with respondents that other       hedging relationships could be directly affected by the reform when the reform gives rise to       uncertainties about the timing or the amount of interest rate benchmark-based cash flows of       the hedged item or of the hedging instrument. Therefore, the IASB confirmed that the       exceptions would apply to the interest rate benchmark-based cash flows in these situations.       The IASB noted that many derivatives, designated in hedging relationships in which there is no       uncertainty about the timing or the amount of interest rate benchmark-based cash flows, could       be indirectly affected by the reform. For example, this would be the case when the valuation       of the derivatives is affected by general uncertainty in the market caused by the reform. The       IASB confirmed that the exceptions do not apply to these hedging relationships, despite the       indirect effect the uncertainties arising from the reform could have on the valuation of       derivatives.</p></body></paragraph>
