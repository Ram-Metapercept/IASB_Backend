Also, situations in which the maturity of the credit default swap exceeds that of the credit exposure could be addressed by using an &#x2018;aligned&#x2019; credit default swap (similar to the notion of &#x2018;aligned&#x2019; time value that is used for the new accounting treatment for the time value of options; see <xref id="IFRS09_X3107" base="F71882642" href="IFRS09_gBC6.386-BC6.413.dita#IFRS09_gBC6.386-BC6.413/IFRS09_gBC6.386-BC6.413_TI">paragraphs BC6.386&#x2013;BC6.409</xref>). However, the aligned credit default swap would only address maturity mismatches. It would not capture other differences between the actual credit default swap and the hedged credit exposure (for example, that a loan might be prepayable) because the insurance approach only intends to change the accounting for the credit default swap instead of adjusting the credit exposure for value changes that reflect all of its characteristics.</p></body></paragraph>
