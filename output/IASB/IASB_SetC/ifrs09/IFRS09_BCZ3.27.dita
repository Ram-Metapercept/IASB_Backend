This is to reflect the transferor&#x2019;s continuing exposure to the risks and rewards of the asset and that this exposure is not related to the entire asset, but is limited in amount. The IASB noted that precluding derecognition to the extent of the continuing involvement is useful to users of financial statements                     in such cases, because it reflects the entity&#x2019;s retained exposure to the risks and rewards of the financial asset better than full derecognition.</p></body></paragraph>
