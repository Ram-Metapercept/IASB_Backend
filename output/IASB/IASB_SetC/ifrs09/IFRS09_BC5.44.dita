The IASB rejected this approach in the 2010 Own Credit Risk Exposure Draft because it believes that changes in the liability&#x2019;s credit risk ought to affect the entity&#x2019;s performance if the liability is measured at fair value. If those amounts were presented directly in equity, they would never be presented in the entity&#x2019;s statement of comprehensive income. The IASB acknowledged that IFRS does not provide a clear objective for when an item should be presented in other comprehensive income instead of in profit or loss or whether the amounts in other comprehensive income should be reclassified to profit or loss. However, the IASB believes that presenting the effects of changes in credit risk in other comprehensive income is preferable to presenting them directly in equity because the latter would create a new problem by causing confusion or creating inconsistencies in what items are presented directly in equity. The IASB noted that remeasurements of assets and liabilities should not be presented directly in equity because remeasurements are not transactions with equity holders. The IASB asked respondents for feedback on presenting directly in equity the effects of changes in a liability&#x2019;s credit risk and almost all respondents, including users, did not support it. Accordingly the IASB did not pursue this alternative.</p>       </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>         <p base="F33207819" id="IFRS09_P6073"><i>Present the entire change in the fair value of liabilities in other comprehensive income:</i> Some believe that the entire change in fair value (not just the portion attributable to changes in credit risk) should be presented in other comprehensive income. They argue that this approach would avoid the difficult question of how to measure the effects of changes in credit risk. The IASB rejected this approach because it believes that at least some of the change in fair value should be presented in profit or loss. The IASB&#x2019;s objective was to address issues related to the effects of changes in liabilities&#x2019; credit risk; therefore, presenting the entire change in fair value in other comprehensive income is not appropriate. Also, this approach would result in mismatches in profit or loss because changes in the fair value of an entity&#x2019;s assets would be presented in profit or loss and changes in the fair value of its liabilities would be presented in other comprehensive income (see similar discussion in paragraph BC5.37). Moreover, this alternative would raise difficult questions about what (if any) amounts should be presented in profit or loss during the life of the liability (eg interest or other financing costs). The IASB has discussed the topic of disaggregating finance costs from other fair value changes on numerous occasions without reaching any conclusions.</p>       </li></ol></body></paragraph>
