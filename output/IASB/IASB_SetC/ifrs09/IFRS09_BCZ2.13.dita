However, the IASB could not find a more compelling approach to resolve its concerns for the short term. Moreover, although the criteria described in paragraph BCZ2.12(a) may appear imprecise, the IASB believes that the criteria would provide a clear answer in the vast majority of cases. <xref id="IFRS09_X2221" base="F71849074" href="IFRS09_BCZ2.6.dita#IFRS09_BCZ2.6">Paragraph B2.6 in IFRS 9</xref> gives guidance on the application of those criteria.</p></body></paragraph>
