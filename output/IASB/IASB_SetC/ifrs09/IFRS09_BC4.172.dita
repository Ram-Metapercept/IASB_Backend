The IASB believes that the effective interest method is suitable only for instruments with &#x2018;simple&#x2019; cash flows that represent solely principal and interest. In contrast, as set out in <xref id="IFRS09_X2519" base="F71850638" href="IFRS09_BC4.23.dita#IFRS09_BC4.23">paragraph BC4.23</xref>, the effective interest method is not an appropriate method for allocating contractual cash flows that are not principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Instead those more complex cash flows require a valuation overlay to contractual cash flows (ie fair value) to ensure that the reported financial information provides useful information.</p></body></paragraph>
