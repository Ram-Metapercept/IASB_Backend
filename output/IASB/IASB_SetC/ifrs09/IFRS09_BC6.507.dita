The IASB received comments on its 2010 Own Credit Risk Exposure Draft that determining the effects of changes in a liability&#x2019;s credit risk can be complex, and that it was therefore necessary to allow some flexibility in how a liability&#x2019;s credit risk could be measured. Respondents to that Exposure Draft, like the IASB, acknowledged that the default method was imprecise but considered the result a reasonable proxy in many cases. Moreover, the IASB noted that respondents to the 2010 Own Credit Risk Exposure Draft did acknowledge that the &#x2018;IFRS 7 method&#x2019; did not isolate changes in a liability&#x2019;s credit risk from other changes in fair value (for example, general changes in the price of credit or changes in liquidity risk). Those respondents said that it was often very difficult or impossible to separate those items.</p></body></paragraph>
