The feedback suggested that this makes the relevant aspects or elements of the hedge effectiveness assessment more difficult to understand. The IASB considered that it could address the respondents&#x2019; request and reduce the abstractness of this proposal by avoiding the use of an &#x2018;umbrella term&#x2019; and instead making explicit all aspects that the requirement comprises. This would provide greater clarity and facilitate a better understanding of what aspects are relevant when assessing hedge effectiveness. </p></body></paragraph>
