In particular, some respondents asked why the requirements issued in IFRS 9 (2009) provided specific guidance for prepayment and extension features that are contingent on future events (&#x2018;contingent prepayment and extension features&#x2019;), but did not provide guidance for other types of features that are contingent on future events (&#x2018;other contingent features&#x2019;). Respondents also asked whether (and if so, why) the nature of the future event in itself affects whether the financial asset&#x2019;s contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest. These respondents generally expressed the view that an entity should focus on the contractual cash flows that could arise over the life of the financial instrument (ie both before and after the future event), instead of on the nature of the future event itself.</p></body></paragraph>
