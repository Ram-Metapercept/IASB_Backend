These respondents asked whether using such an approach would be within the scope of the Phase 2 amendments&#x2014;ie whether <xref href="IFRS09_6.9.1.dita" scope="local">paragraph 6.9.1(c) of IFRS 9</xref> would apply&#x2014;if the approach results in an economic outcome that is similar to changing the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of the derivative.</p></body></paragraph>
