In particular, the IASB observed that this exception will apply to many purchased credit&#x2011;impaired financial assets with contractual prepayment features. If such an asset was purchased at a deep discount, apart from the exception described in <xref id="IFRS09_X2532" base="F71850681" href="IFRS09_BC4.192.dita#IFRS09_BC4.192">paragraph BC4.192</xref>, the contractual cash flows would not be solely payments of principal and interest if, contractually, the asset could be repaid immediately at the par amount. However that contractual prepayment feature would have an insignificant fair value if it is very unlikely that prepayment will occur. The IASB was persuaded by the feedback that stated that amortised cost would provide useful and relevant information to users of financial statements about such financial assets, because the exception applies only to those financial assets that are prepayable at the contractual par amount. Consequently, the prepayment amount does not introduce variability that is inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement because that variability would result only from the time value of money and credit risk elements; ie the entity would receive more of the contractual cash flows than it previously expected, and it would receive those contractual cash flows immediately. The IASB believes that information about that variability would be appropriately captured by amortised cost via the catch&#x2011;up adjustment mechanism.</p></body></paragraph>
