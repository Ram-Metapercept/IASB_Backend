It results in the recognition of gains on credit default swaps while the impairment is recognised on a different measurement basis and with a time lag because of the impairment models. Hence, in a situation in which the situation of a lender deteriorates but it has protected itself, gains are shown even though the protection keeps the situation neutral at best.</p>       </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>         <p base="F33208461" id="IFRS09_P7140">Alternative 2 would use fair value accounting for both the credit default swap and the credit exposure. This would best capture all economic mismatches but would come at the expense of inevitably including in the remeasurement interest rate risk in addition to credit risk. Alternative 2 would have the clearest objective of all the approaches considered (fair value measurement) and, as a result, it would require the least guidance. The IASB noted that under Alternative 2 there could be concerns about earnings management because on electing fair value accounting the difference to the previous carrying amount of the credit exposure would be immediately recognised in profit or loss. However, the IASB also noted that some would consider that outcome as relevant because it would signal a different approach to managing credit risk and this difference would often be a loss that is a reflection of any lag in the impairment model behind the &#x2018;market view&#x2019;. To be consistent, this should be removed by changing the measurement basis when switching to a fair value-based credit risk management.</p>       </li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value>         <p base="F33208463" id="IFRS09_P7141">the accounting under Alternative 2 is completely de-linked from the impairment model and consequently has the least interaction with impairment of all approaches considered.</p>       </li><li><li_value>(d)</li_value>         <p base="F33208465" id="IFRS09_P7142">Alternative 2 is operationally the least complex of the approaches considered.</p>       </li></ol></body></paragraph>
