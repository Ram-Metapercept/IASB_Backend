The IASB noted that both would rely on the assessment of whether an embedded derivative is &#x2018;closely related&#x2019; to the host. The &#x2018;closely related&#x2019; assessment is based on a list of examples that are inconsistent and unclear. That assessment is also a significant source of complexity. Both approaches would result in hybrid contracts being classified using conditions different from those that would be applied to all non-hybrid financial instruments. Consequently, some hybrid contracts whose contractual cash flows do not solely represent payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding might be measured at amortised cost. Similarly, some hybrid contracts whose contractual cash flows do meet the conditions for measurement at amortised cost might be measured at fair value. The IASB also believes that neither approach would make it easier for users of financial statements                     to understand the information that financial statements present about financial instruments.</p></body></paragraph>
