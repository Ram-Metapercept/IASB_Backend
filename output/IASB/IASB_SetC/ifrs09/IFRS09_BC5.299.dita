In the IASB&#x2019;s view, accounting consistently       for a change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows arising as a result of       the reform, even if the contractual terms of the financial instrument are not amended, would       reflect the economic substance of such a change and would therefore provide useful information       to users of financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
