Consequently, the IASB amended the transition paragraph to specify that retrospective       application applies only to those hedging relationships that existed at the beginning of the       reporting period in which an entity first applies those requirements or were designated       thereafter, and to the amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve that existed at the       beginning of the reporting period in which an entity first applies those requirements. The       IASB used this wording to permit an entity to apply the amendments from the beginning of the       reporting period in which an entity first applies these amendments even if the reporting       period is not an annual period.</p></body></paragraph>
