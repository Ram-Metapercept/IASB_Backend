This disconnected accounting from risk management (see <xref base="F71871587" href="IFRS09_gBC6.237-BC6.251.dita#IFRS09_gBC6.237-BC6.251/IFRS09_gBC6.237-BC6.251_TI" id="IFRS09_X2975">paragraph BC6.237</xref>). Consequently, the IASB proposed replacing the bright line test with a notion that aims to reflect the way entities look at the design and monitoring of hedging relationships from a risk management perspective. Inherent in this was the notion of &#x2018;other than accidental offsetting&#x2019;. This linked the risk management perspective with the hedge accounting model&#x2019;s general notion of offset between gains and losses on hedging instruments and hedged items. The IASB also considered that this link reflected the intention that the effectiveness assessment should not be based on a particular level of effectiveness (hence avoiding a new bright line).</p></body></paragraph>
