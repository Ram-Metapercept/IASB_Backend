In addition, the IASB noted that having a single impairment model reduces a significant source of complexity for both users of financial statements and preparers compared with applying IAS 39. The IASB&#x2019;s view was strongly supported by respondents to the 2013 Impairment Exposure Draft. During its redeliberations on the 2013 Impairment Exposure Draft, the IASB, having noted the support from respondents, confirmed the inclusion of these financial assets within the scope of the impairment requirements.</p></body></paragraph>
