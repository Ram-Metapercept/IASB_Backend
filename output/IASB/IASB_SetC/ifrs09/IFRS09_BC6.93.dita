In response, the IASB considered whether it could address those concerns by carrying forward the Implementation Guidance that accompanied <xref base="F71859225" href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001/IAS39_TOC0001_V3" id="IFRS09_X2864">IAS 39</xref> and that illustrated &#x2018;macro cash flow hedge accounting&#x2019;. The IASB noted that to do so would be inconsistent with its decision not to carry forward any of the hedge accounting Implementation Guidance that accompanied IAS 39. The IASB also noted that making an exception by carrying forward some parts of the Implementation Guidance but not others could have unintended consequences because it would inevitably create the perception that the IASB had endorsed some parts while it had rejected others.</p></body></paragraph>
