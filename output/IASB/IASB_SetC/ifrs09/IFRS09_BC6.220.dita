By doing this, such an entity ensures that exposure to benchmark interest rate risk is managed and that the profit margin of the hedged items (ie the spread relative to the benchmark) is protected against LIBOR changes, provided that LIBOR is not below the absolute value of the negative spread. This risk management strategy provides offsetting changes related to the LIBOR-related interest rate risk in a similar way to situations in which the spread above LIBOR is zero or positive. However, if LIBOR falls below the absolute value of that negative spread it would result in &#x2018;negative&#x2019; interest, or interest that is inconsistent with the movement of market interest rates (similar to a &#x2018;reverse floater&#x2019;). The IASB noted that these outcomes are inconsistent with the economic phenomenon to which they relate.</p></body></paragraph>
