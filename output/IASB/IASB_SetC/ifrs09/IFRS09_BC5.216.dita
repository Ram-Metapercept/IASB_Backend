However, this does not mean that all financial assets originated at a high credit risk are within the scope&#x2014;the financial assets have to be credit&#x2011;impaired on initial recognition. In confirming that a financial asset could be credit&#x2011;impaired on origination the IASB focussed on the potential for the modification of contractual cash flows to result in derecognition. The IASB considered an example in which a substantial modification of a distressed asset resulted in derecognition of the original financial asset. Such a case is an example of the rare situation in which a newly originated financial asset may be credit&#x2011;impaired&#x2014;it would be possible for the modification to constitute objective evidence that the new asset is credit&#x2011;impaired at initial recognition.</p></body></paragraph>
