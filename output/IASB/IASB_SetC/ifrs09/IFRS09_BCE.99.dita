The impairment model in IFRS 9 seeks to achieve a balance between the benefits of the faithful representation of expected credit losses and the operational cost and complexity. In other words, IFRS 9 seeks to approximate the 2009 Impairment Exposure Draft to the maximum extent possible in a way that is less operationally burdensome and more cost-effective.</p></body></paragraph>
