Consequently, the IASB decided that, unless it is impracticable, an entity should &#x2018;look through&#x2019; to assess the underlying cash flow characteristics of the financial assets and to assess the exposure to credit risk of those financial assets relative to the underlying pool of instruments.</p></body></paragraph>
