The IASB proposed to continue to account for fair value hedges differently from cash flow hedges. However, the IASB proposed some changes to the presentation and mechanics of fair value hedge accounting:</p><ol base="F33207457" id="IFRS09_L0343" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p base="F33207458" id="IFRS09_P6847">in relation to the gain or loss on remeasuring the hedging instrument&#x2014;<xref base="F71871773" href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001/IAS39_TOC0001_V3" id="IFRS09_X3019">IAS 39</xref> required the gain or loss to be recognised in profit or loss.

The IASB proposed to require the gain or loss to be recognised as an asset or a liability that is presented in a separate line item in the statement of financial position and in other comprehensive income. That separate line item would have been presented within assets (or liabilities) for those reporting periods for which the hedged item is an asset (or a liability).</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
