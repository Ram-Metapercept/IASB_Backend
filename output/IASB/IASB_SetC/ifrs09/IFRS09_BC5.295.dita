In each situation outlined in <xref href="IFRS09_BC5.294.dita">paragraph BC5.294</xref> the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial instrument changes as a result of the reform. Therefore, for the purpose of the Phase 2 amendments, the IASB collectively refers to these changes as &#x2018;changes in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or a financial liability&#x2019;.</p></body></paragraph>
