Given its decision to remove that bright line (see <xref base="F71871580" href="IFRS09_gBC6.237-BC6.251.dita#IFRS09_gBC6.237-BC6.251/IFRS09_gBC6.237-BC6.251_TI" id="IFRS09_X2970">paragraph BC6.237</xref>), the IASB decided to explicitly address this potential for abuse. As a consequence, this Standard requires that, for the purpose of hedge accounting, an entity shall not designate a hedging relationship in a manner that reflects an imbalance between the weightings of the hedged item and the hedging instrument that would create hedge ineffectiveness (irrespective of whether recognised or not) that could result in an accounting outcome that would be inconsistent with the purpose of hedge accounting.</p></body></paragraph>
