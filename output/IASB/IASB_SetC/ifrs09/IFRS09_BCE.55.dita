The clarification will improve the quality of the financial information and its usefulness in assessing the amounts, timing and uncertainty of an entity&#x2019;s future cash flows by resulting in amortised cost measurement only for financial assets that are held with the objective of collecting contractual cash flows.</p></body></paragraph>
