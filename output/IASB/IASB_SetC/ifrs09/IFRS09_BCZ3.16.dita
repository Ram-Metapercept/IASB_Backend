The IASB concluded that an entity does not have an asset and a liability, as defined in the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph>,<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS09_FN0097" type="fn"/> when it enters into an arrangement to pass through cash flows from an asset and that arrangement meets specified conditions. In these cases, the entity acts more as an agent of the eventual recipients of the cash flows than as an owner of the asset. Accordingly, to the extent that those conditions are met the arrangement is treated as a transfer and considered for derecognition even though the entity may continue to collect cash flows from the asset. Conversely, to the extent the conditions are not met, the entity acts more as an owner of the asset with the result that the asset should continue to be recognised.</p>     </variant></body></paragraph>
