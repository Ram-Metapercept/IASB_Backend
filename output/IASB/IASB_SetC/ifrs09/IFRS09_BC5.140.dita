The IASB considered that individual financial assets could be grouped into segments on the basis of common borrower-specific information and the effect of forward&#x2011;looking information (ie changes in macroeconomic indicators) that affect the risk of a default occurring could be considered for each segment. As a result, an entity could use the change in that macroeconomic indicator to determine that the credit risk of one or more segments of financial instruments in the portfolio has increased significantly, although it is not yet possible to identify the individual financial instruments for which credit risk has increased significantly. The IASB also noted that in other cases an entity may use reasonable and supportable information to determine that the credit risk of a homogeneous portion of a portfolio should be considered to have increased significantly in order to meet the objective of recognising all significant increases in credit risk.</p></body></paragraph>
