If the entity&#x2019;s exposure, on a present value basis, had not changed significantly, the entity would conclude that it had retained substantially all risks and rewards. In this case, the IASB concluded that the asset should continue to be recognised. This accounting treatment was consistent with the treatment of repurchase transactions and some assets subject to deep in-the-money options under the original <xref base="F71849382" href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001/IAS39_TOC0001_V3" id="IFRS09_X2268">IAS 39</xref>. It was also consistent with how some interpreted the original IAS 39 when an entity sells a portfolio of short-term receivables but retains all substantive risks through the issue of a guarantee to compensate for all expected credit losses (see the example in <xref base="F71849435" href="IFRS09_BCZ3.3.dita#IFRS09_BCZ3.3" id="IFRS09_X2269">paragraph BCZ3.3</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
