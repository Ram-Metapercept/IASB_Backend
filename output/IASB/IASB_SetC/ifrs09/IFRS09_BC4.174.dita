In the 2012 Limited Amendments Exposure Draft, it proposed a notion of a modified economic relationship between principal and the consideration for time value of money and credit risk&#x2014;and also proposed corresponding clarifications to Instrument B in <xref id="IFRS09_X2521" base="F71850640" href="IFRS09_B4.1.13.dita#IFRS09_B4.1.13">paragraph B4.1.13</xref> of IFRS 9. Specifically, the IASB proposed that a financial asset does not necessarily need to be measured at fair value through profit or loss if the economic relationship between principal and the consideration for time value of money and credit risk is modified by an interest rate tenor mismatch feature. Instead, an entity would be required to assess the effect of the modified relationship on the financial asset&#x2019;s contractual cash flows relative to a &#x2018;perfect&#x2019; benchmark instrument (ie a financial instrument with the same credit quality and with the same contractual terms except for the contractual term under evaluation). If the modification could result in contractual cash flows that are more than insignificantly different from the benchmark cash flows, the contractual terms of the financial asset would not give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. In other words, in the 2012 Limited Amendments Exposure Draft, the IASB clarified that the relationship between principal and the consideration for time value of money and credit risk does not need to be perfect, but only relatively minor modifications of that relationship are consistent with payments that are solely principal and interest.</p></body></paragraph>
