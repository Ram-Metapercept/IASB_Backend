The IASB clarified that the objective of the rebuttable presumption in <xref id="IFRS09_X2764" base="F71857036" href="IFRS09_5.5.11.dita#IFRS09_5.5.11">paragraph 5.5.11 of IFRS 9</xref> is not to be an absolute indicator of when lifetime expected credit losses should be recognised, but serves as a backstop for when there has been a significant increase in credit risk. The IASB noted that the application of the rebuttable presumption should identify significant increases in credit risk before financial assets become credit&#x2011;impaired or an actual default occurs. The IASB also noted that, ideally, significant increases in credit risk should be identified before financial assets become past due.</p></body></paragraph>
