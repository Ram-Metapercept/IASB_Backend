Requiring a contractual relationship would have created a very high threshold for presenting the effects of changes in a liability&#x2019;s credit risk in profit or loss and the IASB decided that such a high threshold was too strict to accommodate all of the possible scenarios in which a mismatch would be created or enlarged by presenting those amounts in other comprehensive income.</p></body></paragraph>
