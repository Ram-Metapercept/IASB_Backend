That approach also considers the entity&#x2019;s business model. Under that approach, financial instruments would be measured at fair value through profit or loss unless:</p><lq> <p id="IFRS09_P5582" base="F33204668">... an entity&#x2019;s business strategy is to hold debt instruments with principal amounts for collection or payment(s) of contractual cash flows rather than to sell or settle the financial instruments with a third party ...</p></lq><p id="IFRS09_P5583" base="F67395152">The FASB also provided explanatory text:</p><lq> <p id="IFRS09_P5584" base="F33204671">... an entity&#x2019;s business strategy for a financial instrument would be evaluated based on how the entity manages its financial instruments rather than based on the entity&#x2019;s intent for an individual financial instrument. The entity also would demonstrate that it holds a high proportion of similar instruments for long periods of time relative to their contractual terms.</p></lq></body></paragraph>
