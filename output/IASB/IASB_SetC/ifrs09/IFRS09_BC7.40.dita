The IASB noted that it is currently discussing the objective of other comprehensive income, including whether amounts should be recycled to profit or loss (and if so, when), in its project on the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> and therefore the IASB noted that it would be inappropriate to reconsider those requirements in IFRS 9 before it completes that work.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS09_FN0133" type="fn"/></p></variant></body></paragraph>
