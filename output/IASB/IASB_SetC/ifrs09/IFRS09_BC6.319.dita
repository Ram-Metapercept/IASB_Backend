The IASB noted that this would allow hedge accounting to be discontinued even if the entity for risk management purposes continued to hedge the exposure in accordance with its risk management objective that was part of the qualifying criteria that initially allowed the entity to achieve hedge accounting. The IASB considered that, in such situations, voluntary discontinuation of hedge accounting would be arbitrary and unjustifiable. Hence, the IASB decided to propose not to allow entities a free choice to revoke the designation of a hedging relationship in this situation. The IASB also noted that if the hedging relationship no longer reflected the risk management objective for that particular hedging relationship, discontinuation of hedge accounting was not a choice but was required because the qualifying criteria would no longer be met. The IASB considered that applying hedge accounting without a risk management objective would not provide useful information.</p></body></paragraph>
