The IASB also noted that a similar transition provision is needed for the exception for particular prepayment features described in paragraph <xref base="F71918328" href="IFRS09_B4.1.12.dita#IFRS09_B4.1.12" id="IFRS09_X3229">B4.1.12 of IFRS 9</xref>. That is because an entity will need to determine whether a prepayable financial asset meets the conditions set out in that paragraph on the basis of the facts and circumstances that existed at the initial recognition of the financial asset, including whether the fair value of the prepayment feature was insignificant. The IASB noted that, in some cases, it may be impracticable for an entity to determine whether the fair value of the prepayment feature was insignificant at the date of initial recognition. For example, this determination might be impracticable if the entity did not account for that embedded prepayment feature separately at fair value through profit or loss as an embedded derivative under <xref base="F71918329" href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001/IAS39_TOC0001_V3" id="IFRS09_X3230">IAS 39</xref>. Consequently, the IASB decided that in cases in which it is impracticable for an entity to assess whether the fair value of a prepayment feature was insignificant based on the facts and circumstances that existed at the initial recognition of the asset, the entity must assess the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset without taking into account the specific exception for prepayment features.</p></body></paragraph>
