This has led the IASB to emphasise the need for a portfolio perspective when significant increases in credit risk cannot be identified on an individual financial instrument level to ensure that IFRS 9 is applied on an appropriately forward-looking basis. The work with participants showed that statistical methods and techniques could be used to analyse subportfolios to capture significant increases in credit risk even when that is not evident based on customer-specific information at the level of individual financial instruments.</p></body></paragraph>
