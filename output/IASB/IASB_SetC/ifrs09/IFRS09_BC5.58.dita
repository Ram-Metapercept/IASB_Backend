The application guidance in IFRS 7 provided a default method for determining that amount. If the only relevant changes in market conditions for the liability are changes in an observed (benchmark) interest rate, that method attributes all changes in fair value, other than changes in the benchmark interest rate, to changes in the credit risk of the liability. In the Basis for Conclusions on IFRS 7, the IASB acknowledged that quantifying the change in a liability&#x2019;s credit risk might be difficult in practice. It noted that it believes that the default method provides a reasonable proxy for changes in the liability&#x2019;s credit risk, in particular when such changes are large, and would provide users                     with information with which to understand the effect on profit or loss of such a change in credit risk. However, IFRS 7 permitted entities to use a different method if it provides a more faithful representation of the changes in the liability&#x2019;s credit risk.</p></body></paragraph>
