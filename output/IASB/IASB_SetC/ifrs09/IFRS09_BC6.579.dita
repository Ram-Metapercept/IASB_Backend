At the inception of the relationship, the entity assesses whether LIBOR is a separately identifiable risk component for all loans designated within the hedging relationship. As the entity updates the risk position with the origination of new loans and the maturity or repayment of existing loans, the hedging relationship is adjusted by de-designating the &#x2018;old&#x2019; hedging relationship and redesignating a &#x2018;new&#x2019; hedging relationship for the updated amount of the hedged items. Applying the exception in paragraph 6.8.8 of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 9</ph></ph> requires the entity to assess whether LIBOR is a separately identifiable risk component only for the new loans added to the hedging relationship. The entity would not reassess the separately identifiable requirement for the loans that have been redesignated.</p></body></paragraph>
