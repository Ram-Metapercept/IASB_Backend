Designating a non-derivative financial asset or liability denominated in a foreign currency as a hedge of foreign currency risk in accordance with IAS 39 was equivalent to designating a risk component of a hedging instrument in a hedging relationship. This foreign currency risk component is determined in accordance with <xref base="F71859346" href="../ias21/IAS21_TOC.dita#IAS21_TOC0001" id="IFRS09_X2889"><ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 21</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates</ph></ph></xref>. Because the foreign currency risk component is determined in accordance with foreign currency translation requirements in IAS 21, it is already available for incorporation by reference in the financial instruments Standard. Consequently, permitting the use of a foreign currency risk component for hedge accounting purposes did not require separate, additional requirements for risk components within the hedge accounting model. </p></body></paragraph>
