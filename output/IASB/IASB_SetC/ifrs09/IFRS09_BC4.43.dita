Respondents also noted that the alternative approach would apply only to financial assets. Lastly, almost all respondents noted that splitting gains and losses between profit or loss and other comprehensive income would increase complexity and reduce understandability.                     The IASB concluded that those approaches would not result in more useful information than the approach in IFRS 9 and did not consider them further.</p></body></paragraph>
