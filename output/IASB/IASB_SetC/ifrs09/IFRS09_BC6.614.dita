Therefore, an entity may be required to apply the applicable Phase 2 exceptions in <xref href="IFRS09_g6.9.1-6.9.13.dita" scope="local">paragraphs 6.9.1&#x2013;6.9.12 of IFRS 9</xref> at different times, which may result in the designation of a particular hedging relationship being amended more than once. The Phase 2 amendments to the hedge accounting requirements in IFRS 9 apply only to the requirements specified in these paragraphs. All other hedge accounting requirements in IFRS 9, including the qualifying criteria in <xref href="IFRS09_6.4.1.dita" scope="local">paragraph 6.4.1 of IFRS 9</xref>, apply to hedging relationships directly affected by the reform. In addition, consistent with the IASB&#x2019;s decision for the Phase 1 amendments (see <xref href="IFRS09_BC6.568.dita" scope="local">paragraph BC6.568</xref>), the Phase 2 amendments also do not provide an exception from the measurement requirements for a hedging relationship. Therefore, entities apply the requirements in <xref href="IFRS09_6.5.8.dita" scope="local">paragraphs 6.5.8</xref> or <xref href="IFRS09_6.5.11.dita" scope="local">6.5.11 of IFRS 9</xref> to account for any changes in the fair value of the hedged items or hedging instruments (also see <xref href="IFRS09_gBC6.623-BC6.627.dita" scope="local">paragraphs BC6.623&#x2013;BC6.627</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
