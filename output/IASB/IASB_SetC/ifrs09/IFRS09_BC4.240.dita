Many respondents to that Exposure Draft highlighted the importance of finalising the amendments before the effective date of IFRS 9 and the IASB noted that prioritising such timing would preclude the Board from conducting outreach to assess those alternatives. Moreover, the IASB doubted whether those alternatives would better achieve its objective without introducing significant complexity to the amendments. Therefore, the IASB decided not to replace the second proposed eligibility condition with any of those alternatives.</p></body></paragraph>
