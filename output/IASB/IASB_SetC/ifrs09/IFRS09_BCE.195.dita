For example, being able to designate a full LIBOR component in a financial instrument that yields LIBOR less a spread (colloquially referred to as &#x2018;sub-LIBOR&#x2019;). Such respondents believed that it should be possible to hedge the LIBOR risk as a benchmark component and treat the spread as a negative residual component, as they hedged their exposure to the variability of cash flows attributable to LIBOR (or a correlated index) using LIBOR swaps.</p></body></paragraph>
