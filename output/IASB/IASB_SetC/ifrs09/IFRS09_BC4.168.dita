In addition, the IASB noted that measuring financial assets at amortised cost only if the entity has the ability to negotiate the asset&#x2019;s terms with the counterparty might be unduly costly to implement and complex to apply and also might result in different classification of lending activities solely as a result of the different legal frameworks in different jurisdictions. The IASB also noted that, under the business-activity approach, the form of the financial asset would affect its classification; for example, widely-held bonds would typically fail to meet the criteria to be measured at amortised cost, because the holder is generally unable to renegotiate the terms with the counterparty on a bilateral basis. Accordingly, the IASB decided not to pursue the business-activity approach and instead confirmed the approach in IFRS 9, in which financial assets are measured at amortised cost if they are held with an objective to collect contractual cash flows (subject to the assessment of the asset&#x2019;s contractual cash flow characteristics) and reaffirmed the rationale for the business model assessment set out in <xref id="IFRS09_X2509" base="F71850596" href="IFRS09_gBC4.15-BC4.21.dita#IFRS09_gBC4.15-BC4.21/IFRS09_gBC4.15-BC4.21_TI">paragraphs BC4.15&#x2014;BC4.21</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
