However, Ms McConnell believes that IFRS 9 has not accomplished that objective. IFRS 9 would permit or require the following categories: (1) amortised cost, (2) a fair value option through profit or loss for financial assets that qualify for amortised cost but for which amortised cost would create an accounting mismatch, (3) fair value through profit or loss for debt instruments that fail to qualify for amortised cost, (4) fair value though profit or loss for trading securities, (5) fair value through profit or loss for equity securities not held for trading and (6) fair value through other comprehensive income for equity investments not held for trading. Ms McConnell does not view those six categories as a significant improvement over the six categories in <xref href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita" id="IFRS09_X3379" scope="local">IAS 39</xref>; like the categories in IAS 39, they will hinder investors&#x2019; understanding of an already complex area of financial reporting.</p></body></paragraph>
