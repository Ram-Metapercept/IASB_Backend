Some respondents who disagreed did so because they believed that voluntary discontinuation was necessary in scenarios in which an entity decided to terminate a hedging relationship on the basis that the hedge was no longer cost efficient (for example, a high administrative burden makes it is too onerous and costly to apply hedge accounting). Some of these respondents raised the concern that voluntary discontinuation was an important tool in the current hedge accounting model for financial institutions that normally run hedging programmes based on portfolios of items on a macro basis. Those portfolios were subject to constant changes and entities removed the hedge designation with the aim of adjusting the hedging relationship for new hedged items and hedging instruments.</p></body></paragraph>
