In addition, to respond to the feedback described in <xref href="IFRS09_BC6.576.dita">paragraph BC6.576</xref>, the IASB added the exception in <xref href="IFRS09_6.8.8.dita">paragraph 6.8.8 of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 9</ph></ph></xref> for hedging relationships that, consistent with an entity&#x2019;s hedge documentation, frequently reset (ie discontinue and restart) because both the hedging instrument and the hedged item frequently change. Applying that paragraph, an entity shall determine whether the risk component is separately identifiable only when it initially designates an item as a hedged item in the hedging relationship. The hedged item is not reassessed at any subsequent redesignation in the same hedging relationship.</p></body></paragraph>
