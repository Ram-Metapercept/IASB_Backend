The IASB also noted that the changes required by the reform described in <xref href="IFRS09_5.4.6.dita" scope="local">paragraphs 5.4.6&#x2013;5.4.8 of IFRS 9</xref> were implicit in the required amendments to the hedging relationships as proposed in the 2020 Exposure Draft. In considering the timing of when entities are required to amend an affected hedging relationship, the IASB sought to balance the operational effort needed to amend the hedging relationships with maintaining the required discipline in the amendments to hedging relationships. Specifically, it sought to address the challenges associated with specifying the timing of when entities have to amend hedging relationships as required in <xref href="IFRS09_6.9.1.dita" scope="local">paragraph 6.9.1 of IFRS 9</xref>&#x2014;particularly in the context of the large volume of changes that entities may need to make in a relatively short time&#x2014;while also ensuring that the amendments to hedging relationships are accounted for in the applicable reporting period.</p></body></paragraph>
