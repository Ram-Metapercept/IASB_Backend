The IASB noted that for hedges of transaction related hedged items, using the forward rate method to measure the hedged item would allow entities to achieve an equivalent accounting outcome for the forward element of forward contracts (see <xref id="IFRS09_X2990" base="F71871664" href="IFRS09_BC6.418.dita#IFRS09_BC6.418">paragraphs BC6.418&#x2013;BC6.420</xref>). However, the IASB acknowledged that in order to allow a similar accounting outcome not only for the forward element of forward contracts but also for foreign currency basis spreads, entities would need to be able to apply the notion of &#x2018;costs of hedging&#x2019;, including for hedges of transaction related hedged items. Consequently, the IASB introduced the notion of &#x2018;costs of hedging&#x2019; also for those types of cost of hedging for both hedges of time-period related hedged items and for hedges of transaction related hedged items.</p></body></paragraph>
