As a result, an entity applying the practical expedient to account for a change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or a financial liability that is required by the reform would not apply the derecognition requirements to that financial instrument, and would not apply <xref href="IFRS09_5.4.3.dita">paragraphs 5.4.3</xref> or <xref href="IFRS09_B5.4.6.dita">B5.4.6 of IFRS 9</xref> to account for the change in contractual cash flows. In other words, changes in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or a financial liability that are required by the reform would not result in an adjustment to the carrying amount of the financial instrument or immediate recognition of a gain or loss. The IASB concluded that the application of the practical expedient would provide useful information about the effect of the reform on an entity&#x2019;s financial instruments in the circumstances in which it applies.</p></body></paragraph>
