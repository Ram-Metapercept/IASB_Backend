Specifically, entities:</p><ol id="IFRS09_L0382" base="F33205768" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P7184" base="SL33206344">would be permitted to early apply the completed version of IFRS 9; but</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P7185" base="SL33206345">entities would not be permitted to newly early apply a previous version of IFRS 9 if the entity&#x2019;s relevant date of initial application is six months or more after the completed version of IFRS 9 is issued. However, if the entity&#x2019;s relevant date of initial application is less than six months after the completed version of IFRS 9 is issued, an entity would be permitted to continue to apply that version until the completed version of IFRS 9 becomes mandatorily effective.</p></li></ol><p id="IFRS09_P7186" base="F33205773">These proposals did not affect the provision in IFRS 9 that permits an entity to early apply only the requirements related to the presentation of &#x2018;own credit&#x2019; gains and losses on financial liabilities designated under the fair value option. Moreover, the proposals did not affect those entities that chose to early apply a previous version of IFRS 9 before the completed version of IFRS 9 was issued. Those entities would be permitted to continue to apply that previous version of IFRS 9 until the completed version of IFRS 9 is mandatorily effective.</p></body></paragraph>
