Most respondents to the 2012 Limited Amendments Exposure Draft&#x2014;as well as participants in the IASB&#x2019;s outreach programme&#x2014;generally supported the proposed limited amendments. However, many asked the IASB for clarifications or additional guidance on particular aspects of the proposals. The IASB considered the responses in the comment letters and the information received during its outreach activities when it finalised the limited amendments in July 2014.</p></body></paragraph>
