The IASB considered that the proposed objective of hedge accounting reflected a broad articulation of a principle-based approach with a focus on the purpose of the entity&#x2019;s risk management activities. In addition, the objective also provided for a focus on the statement of financial position and the statement of comprehensive income, thereby reflecting the effects of the individual assets and liabilities associated with the risk management activities on those statements. This reflected the IASB&#x2019;s intention: that entities should provide useful information about the purpose and effect of hedging instruments for which hedge accounting is applied.</p></body></paragraph>
