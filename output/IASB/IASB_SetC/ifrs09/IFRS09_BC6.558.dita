This requirement is intended to ensure that changes in the fair value of designated hedging instruments are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve only for those hedged forecast transactions that are highly probable to occur. This requirement is an important discipline in applying hedge accounting to forecast transactions. The IASB noted that the requirements in <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 9</ph></ph> provide a clear basis to account for the effects of the reform&#x2014;that is, if the effects of the reform are such that the hedged cash flows are no longer highly probable, hedge accounting should be discontinued. As set out in <xref href="IFRS09_BC6.550.dita">paragraph BC6.550</xref>, in the IASB&#x2019;s view, discontinuing all affected hedging relationships solely due to such uncertainty would not provide useful information to users of financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
