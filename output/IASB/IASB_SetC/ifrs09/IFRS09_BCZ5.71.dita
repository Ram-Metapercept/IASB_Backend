It related to whether the revised or the original effective interest rate of a debt instrument should be applied when remeasuring the instrument&#x2019;s carrying amount on the cessation of fair value hedge accounting. A revised effective interest rate is calculated when fair value hedge accounting ceases. The IASB removed this inconsistency as part of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Improvements to IFRSs</ph></ph> issued in May 2008 by clarifying that the remeasurement of an instrument in accordance with paragraph AG8 (now <xref base="F71854856" href="IFRS09_B5.4.6.dita#IFRS09_B5.4.6" id="IFRS09_X2675">paragraph B5.4.6 of IFRS 9</xref>) is based on the revised effective interest rate calculated in accordance with paragraph 92 (now <xref base="F71854857" href="IFRS09_6.5.10.dita#IFRS09_6.5.10" id="IFRS09_X2676">paragraph 6.5.10 of IFRS 9</xref>), when applicable, instead of the original effective interest rate.</p></body></paragraph>
