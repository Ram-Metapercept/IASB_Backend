Most constituents said that in its deliberations on financial liabilities the IASB should not be constrained or biased by the requirements in IFRS 9 for financial assets.</p>       </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>         <p base="F33204943" id="IFRS09_P5657">Amortised cost is the most appropriate measurement attribute for many financial liabilities because it reflects the issuer&#x2019;s legal obligation to pay the contractual amounts in the normal course of business (ie on a going concern basis) and in many cases, the issuer will hold liabilities to maturity and pay the contractual amounts. However, if a liability has structured features (eg embedded derivatives), amortised cost is difficult to apply and understand because the cash flows can be highly variable.</p>       </li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value>         <p base="F33204945" id="IFRS09_P5658">The bifurcation methodology in <xref base="F71849802" href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001/IAS39_TOC0001_V3" id="IFRS09_X2345">IAS 39</xref> is generally working well and practice has developed since those requirements were issued. For many entities, bifurcation avoids the issue of own credit risk because the host is measured at amortised cost and only the derivative is measured at fair value through profit or loss. Many constituents, including users of financial statements, favoured retaining bifurcation for financial liabilities even though they supported eliminating it for financial assets. That was because bifurcation addresses the issue of own credit risk, which is only relevant for financial liabilities. Users preferred structured assets to be measured at fair value in their entirety. Many constituents were sceptical that a new bifurcation methodology could be developed that was less complex and provided more useful information than using the bifurcation methodology in IAS 39. Moreover, a new bifurcation methodology would be likely to have the same classification and measurement outcomes as the existing methodology in most cases.</p>       </li><li><li_value>(d)</li_value>         <p base="F33204947" id="IFRS09_P5659">The IASB should not develop a new measurement attribute. The almost unanimous view was that a &#x2018;full&#x2019; fair value amount is more understandable                                 and useful than an &#x2018;adjusted&#x2019; fair value amount that ignores the effects of changes in the liability&#x2019;s credit risk.</p>       </li><li><li_value>(e)</li_value>         <p base="F33204949" id="IFRS09_P5660">Even for preparers with sophisticated valuation expertise, it is difficult to determine the amount of change in the fair value of a liability that is attributable to changes in its credit risk. Under existing Standards only entities that elect to designate liabilities under the fair value option are required to determine that amount. If the IASB were to extend that requirement to more entities and to more financial liabilities, many entities would have significant difficulty determining that amount and could incur significant costs in doing so.</p>       </li></ol></body></paragraph>
