It was concerned (a) about difficulties in measuring the change in value of the component because of ordering issues and joint effects (ie if the component is affected by more than one risk, it may be difficult to isolate accurately and measure the component); (b) that the amounts recognised in the balance sheet would be neither fair value nor cost; and (c) that a fair value adjustment for a component might move the carrying amount of an instrument away from its fair value. In finalising the 2003 amendments to IAS 39, the IASB separately considered the issue of cash instrument hedging (see <xref base="F71850052" href="../ias39/IAS39_BC144.dita#IAS39_BC144" id="IFRS09_X2394">paragraphs BC144</xref> and <xref base="F71850053" href="../ias39/IAS39_BC145.dita#IAS39_BC145" id="IFRS09_X2395">BC145 of the Basis for Conclusions on IAS 39</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
