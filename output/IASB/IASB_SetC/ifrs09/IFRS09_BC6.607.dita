This is because, as part of the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting to be applied, IFRS 9 requires the formal designation of a hedging relationship to be documented at inception. The hedge documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess hedge effectiveness. IFRS 9 permits the hedge designation and documentation to be amended without causing the discontinuation of hedge accounting only in limited circumstances. In all other circumstances, amendments to the hedge designation as documented at inception of the hedging relationship, result in the discontinuation of hedge accounting.</p></body></paragraph>
