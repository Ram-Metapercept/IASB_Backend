Hence, the IASB decided to also propose to clarify that a history of having designated hedges of forecast transactions and having subsequently determined that the forecast transactions are no longer expected to occur would call into question the entity&#x2019;s ability to predict similar forecast transactions accurately. This would affect the assessment of whether similar forecast transactions are highly probable and hence their eligibility as hedged items.</p></body></paragraph>
