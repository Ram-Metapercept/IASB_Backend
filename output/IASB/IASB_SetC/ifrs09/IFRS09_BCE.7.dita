They have urged the IASB to develop a new Standard for the financial reporting for financial instruments that is principle-based and less complex. The need to enhance the relevance and understandability of information about financial instruments was also raised by respondents to the Discussion Paper <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Reducing Complexity in Reporting Financial Instruments</ph></ph> (published in 2008).
