The IASB considered that allowing voluntary application of these amendments could lead to selective application to achieve specific accounting results. The IASB also noted that the amendments are, to a large extent, interlinked and need to be applied consistently. Voluntary application, even if only possible by area or type of financial instruments, would reduce comparability of information provided in the financial statements between entities. The IASB also does not expect that mandatory application of these amendments would result in significant additional costs for preparers and other affected parties because these amendments are designed to ease the operational burden on preparers, while providing useful information to users of financial statements, and would not require significantly more effort by preparers in addition to what is already required to implement the changes required by the reform.</p></body></paragraph>
