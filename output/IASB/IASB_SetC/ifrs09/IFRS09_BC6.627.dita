Therefore, an entity would apply the requirements in <xref href="IFRS09_6.5.8.dita" scope="local">paragraphs 6.5.8</xref> (for a fair value hedge) and <xref href="IFRS09_6.5.11.dita" scope="local">6.5.11</xref> (for a cash flow hedge) of IFRS 9 for the measurement and recognition of hedge ineffectiveness. The IASB considered that accounting for such fair value changes in any other way would be inconsistent with the decision to continue applying hedge accounting for such amended hedging relationships (see <xref href="IFRS09_6.9.1.dita" scope="local">paragraph 6.9.1 of IFRS 9</xref>). In the IASB&#x2019;s view, applying the requirements in IFRS 9 for the recognition and measurement of ineffectiveness reflects the economic effects of the amendments to the formal designation of a hedging relationship and therefore, provides useful information to users of financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
