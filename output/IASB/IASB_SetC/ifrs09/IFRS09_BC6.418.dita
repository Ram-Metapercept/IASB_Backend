In contrast to many typical situations in which options were used to hedge transactions that did not involve a time value notion because they were not options (see <xref base="F71871934" href="IFRS09_BC6.388.dita#IFRS09_BC6.388" id="IFRS09_X3056">paragraph BC6.388</xref>), in situations in which forward contracts were used the value of hedged items typically did have a forward element that corresponded to that of the hedge. The IASB noted that this meant that an entity could choose to designate the forward contract in its entirety and use the &#x2018;forward rate method&#x2019; to measure the hedged item.</p></body></paragraph>
