In other words, the IASB proposed that, in those cases, the entity would apply the assessment of the asset&#x2019;s contractual cash flows characteristics as that assessment was set out in the requirements issued in IFRS 9 (2009); ie without the notion of a modified economic relationship.</p></body></paragraph>
