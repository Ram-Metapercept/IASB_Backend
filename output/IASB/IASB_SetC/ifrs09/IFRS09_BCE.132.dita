To undertake this analysis properly was a very intensive exercise, because it required not only an understanding of existing data but also that entities analyse how they would expect the macroeconomic changes described to affect credit risk over time for their chosen portfolios.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS09_FN0140" type="fn"/> Given the intensiveness of the exercise, the sample size was necessarily limited and only 15 participants took part in the fieldwork. However, in order to make the exercise as representative as possible, participants included both financial and non-financial (lessor) entities, multinational and regional (or country)-based businesses, Basel-regulated and non-Basel-regulated entities and entities with various levels of sophistication in credit risk management systems. There was also a mixture of the type of portfolios that participants selected, which in aggregate had a total carrying amount in excess of US$500 billion and included:<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS09_FN0141" type="fn"/></p><ol id="IFRS09_L0411" base="F33205310" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P7506" base="F33205311">retail mortgages, including:</p> <ol id="IFRS09_L0412" base="F33205324" type="lower-roman"><li><li_value>(i)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P7507" base="F33205325">amortising loans;</p></li><li><li_value>(ii)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P7508" base="F33205327">interest only loans; and</p></li><li><li_value>(iii)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P7509" base="F33205329">equity-line loans.</p></li></ol></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P7510" base="F33205331">corporate (wholesale) loans;</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P7511" base="F33205333">revolving credit products (for example, credit cards);</p></li><li><li_value>(d)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P7512" base="F33205335">lease receivables (for example, vehicle finance); and</p></li><li><li_value>(e)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P7513" base="F33205337">other unsecured lending, for example, personal loans/payday loans.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
