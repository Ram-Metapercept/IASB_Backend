The spread between the risk-free rate and the market interest rate incorporates credit risk, liquidity risk, funding risk and any other unidentified risk component and margin elements. Although it is possible to determine that the spread includes credit risk, the credit risk cannot be isolated in a way that would allow the change in fair value that is attributable solely to credit risk to be separately identifiable (see also <xref id="IFRS09_X3091" base="F71872123" href="IFRS09_BC6.503.dita#IFRS09_BC6.503">paragraph BC6.503</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
