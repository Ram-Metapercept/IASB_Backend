The IASB therefore decided to clarify the relevant paragraphs in the application guidance to IFRS 9. However, it noted that the clarification described in <xref id="IFRS09_X2555" base="F71923060" href="IFRS09_BC4.206.dita#IFRS09_BC4.206">paragraph BC4.206(a)</xref> would be addressed as a result of the general clarifications made to the requirements for contingent prepayment features.</p></body></paragraph>
