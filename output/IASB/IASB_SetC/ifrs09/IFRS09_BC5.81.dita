The definition is also necessary for the newly introduced disclosure requirements about expected credit losses. The 2009 Impairment Exposure Draft proposed definitions and requirements related to the term &#x2018;write off&#x2019;. Following positive comments about those definitions, the IASB decided to retain the definitions and requirements related to the term &#x2018;write-off&#x2019; in IFRS 9 with minimal changes to the definition proposed in the 2009 Impairment Exposure Draft.</p></body></paragraph>
