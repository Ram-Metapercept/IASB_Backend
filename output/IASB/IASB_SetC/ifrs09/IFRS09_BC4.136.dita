A financial asset was measured at amortised cost only if it was held within a business model whose objective was to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows (a &#x2018;hold to collect&#x2019; business model), subject also to an assessment of the asset&#x2019;s contractual cash flow characteristics. All other financial assets were measured at fair value through profit or loss. <xref id="IFRS09_X2482" base="F71850482" href="IFRS09_BC4.15.dita#IFRS09_BC4.15">Paragraph BC4.15&#x2013;BC4.21</xref> describe the IASB&#x2019;s rationale for that assessment.</p></body></paragraph>
