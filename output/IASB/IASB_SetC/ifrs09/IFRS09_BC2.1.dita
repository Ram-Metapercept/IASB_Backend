Consequently, the scope of IAS 39 was carried forward to IFRS 9. It has been changed only as a consequence of other new requirements, such as to reflect the changes to the accounting for expected credit losses on loan commitments that an entity issues (see <xref base="F71843759" href="IFRS09_BC2.8.dita#IFRS09_BC2.8" id="IFRS09_X2193">paragraph BC2.8</xref>). As a result, most of paragraphs in this section of the Basis for Conclusions were carried forward from the <xref base="F71843760" href="../ias39/IAS39_BC_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0005/IAS39_TOC0005_V2" id="IFRS09_X2194">Basis for Conclusion on IAS 39</xref> and describe the IASB&#x2019;s rationale when it set the scope of that Standard.</p></body></paragraph>
