The IASB concluded that a single classification approach for all financial instruments and hybrid contracts with financial hosts was the only approach that responded adequately to the criticisms described above. The IASB noted that using a single classification approach improves comparability                     by ensuring consistency in classification, and hence makes it easier for users to understand the information that financial statements present about financial instruments.            </p></body></paragraph>
