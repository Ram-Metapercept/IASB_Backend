Users of financial statements will also be provided with more information to understand entities&#x2019; credit risk management processes and the credit risk inherent in their financial instruments. The IASB is of the view that loss allowances should reflect credit loss expectations for financial instruments as at the reporting date.</p></body></paragraph>
