Thus, under IFRS 9, a hybrid financial asset is classified as a whole using the same classification approach as all other financial assets. That is in contrast to <xref base="F71918578" href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001/IAS39_TOC0001_V3" id="IFRS09_X3274">IAS 39</xref>, in which components of a financial asset could have been classified and measured separately&#x2014;resulting in a component of a financial asset being measured at amortised cost or classified as available-for-sale, while some or all of the embedded features were measured at fair value through profit or loss, even though the financial asset was a single instrument that was settled as a whole on the basis of all of its features.</p></body></paragraph>
