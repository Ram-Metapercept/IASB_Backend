In the first step, the entity would present the entire fair value change in profit or loss. In the second step, the entity would &#x2018;back out&#x2019; from profit or loss the portion of the fair value change that is attributable to changes in the liability&#x2019;s credit risk and present that amount in other comprehensive income.</p></body></paragraph>
