Thus, in May 2010 the IASB published an Exposure Draft <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Fair Value Option for Financial Liabilities</ph></ph> (the &#x2018;2010 Own Credit Risk Exposure Draft&#x2019;), which proposed that the effects of changes in the credit risk of liabilities designated under the fair value option would be presented in other comprehensive income. The IASB considered the responses to 2010 Own Credit Risk Exposure Draft and finalised amendments to IFRS 9 in October 2010 (see paragraphs <xref id="IFRS09_X2353" base="F71849844" href="IFRS09_gBC5.35-BC5.64.dita#IFRS09_gBC5.35-BC5.64/IFRS09_gBC5.35-BC5.64_TI">BC5.35&#x2013;BC5.64</xref>). Those amendments also eliminated the cost exception for particular derivative liabilities that will be settled by delivering unquoted equity instruments<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS09_FN0101" type="fn"/> whose fair values cannot be reliably determined (see <xref id="IFRS09_X2354" base="F71849846" href="IFRS09_gBC5.20-BC5.20.dita#IFRS09_gBC5.20-BC5.20/IFRS09_gBC5.20-BC5.20_TI">paragraph BC5.20</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
