For example, if an entity designates a hedged item that is based on LIBOR against a hedging instrument that is already referenced to an alternative benchmark rate (assuming the entity can demonstrate that hedging relationship meets the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting in <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 9</ph></ph>), the exceptions in <xref href="IFRS09_6.8.4.dita">paragraphs 6.8.4</xref> and <xref href="IFRS09_6.8.6.dita">6.8.6 of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 9</ph></ph></xref> would apply for the hedged item because there is uncertainty related to its future cash flows. However, there is no uncertainty regarding how the reform would impact the cash flows of the hedging instrument and, therefore, the exception in paragraph 6.8.6 of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 9</ph></ph> is not applicable for the hedging instrument. Similarly, the exception applicable to non-contractually specified components would not be relevant for hedging relationships that do not involve the designation of non-contractually specified risk components.</p></body></paragraph>
