In considering respondents&#x2019; comments, the IASB noted that the 2013 Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting Exposure Draft was intended to address a narrow issue&#x2014;novation to CCPs&#x2014;and therefore changing the phrase &#x2018;if and only if&#x2019; to &#x2018;if&#x2019; would target the amendment on the fact patterns that the IASB sought to address.
