Accordingly, the IASB decided to separately deliberate on the accounting for macro hedging as part of its active agenda with the objective of issuing a Discussion Paper. The IASB noted that this would enable IFRS 9 to be completed more quickly and would enable the new &#x2018;general&#x2019; hedge accounting requirements to be available as part of IFRS 9. The IASB also noted that during the project on accounting for macro hedging the status quo of &#x2018;macro hedge accounting' under previous Standards would broadly be maintained so that entities would not be worse off in the meantime.</p></body></paragraph>
