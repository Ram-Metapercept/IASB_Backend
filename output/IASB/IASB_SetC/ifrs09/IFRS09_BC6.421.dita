The reason was that, like IAS 39, the proposals in the 2010 Hedge Accounting Exposure Draft did not allow the forward element to be amortised. For example, if an entity hedged the fair value changes resulting from the price changes of its existing commodity inventory (ie a time-period related hedged item) it could, under the proposals in the 2010 Hedge Accounting Exposure Draft (like IAS 39), either:</p><ol base="F33207871" id="IFRS09_L0357" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p base="F33207872" id="IFRS09_P6955">use the forward rate method (ie forward elements are capitalised into the cost of inventory, instead of being accounted for as at fair value through profit or loss over the time of the hedge); or</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p base="F33207874" id="IFRS09_P6956">designate as the hedging instrument only changes in the spot element (ie fair value changes in the forward element of the forward contract are recognised in profit or loss).</p></li></ol><p base="F33207875" id="IFRS09_P6957">Neither of the above accounting outcomes are aligned with the treatment for the time value of options for time-period related hedged items that requires that the time value is amortised on a systematic and rational basis.</p></body></paragraph>
