Most of the respondents that disagreed with the second eligibility condition said the first eligibility condition (discussed above in <xref id="IFRS09_X2579" base="F74065362" href="IFRS09_gBC4.222-BC4.232.dita#IFRS09_gBC4.222-BC4.232/IFRS09_gBC4.222-BC4.232_TI">paragraphs BC4.222&#x2013;BC4.232</xref>) was sufficient. They expressed the view that the requirements in <xref id="IFRS09_X2580" base="F74065363" href="IFRS09_B4.1.11.dita#IFRS09_B4.1.11/IFRS09_B4.1.11_V2">paragraph B4.1.11(b) of IFRS 9</xref> should accommodate reasonable negative compensation for the early termination of the contract without additional restrictions; ie an entity should be required to assess negative compensation for the early termination of the contract in the same way as it assesses additional compensation for the early termination of the contract. Some respondents suggested alternatives that they thought would better achieve the IASB&#x2019;s objective. Those suggestions included assessing the probability that prepayment, or negative compensation, will occur.</p></body></paragraph>
