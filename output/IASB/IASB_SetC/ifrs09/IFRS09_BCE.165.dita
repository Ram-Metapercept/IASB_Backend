As mentioned in <xref id="IFRS09_X3340" base="F71918904" href="IFRS09_BCE.172.dita#IFRS09_BCE.172">paragraph BCE.172</xref>, the IASB decided to include requirements that provide users of financial statements with information about how an entity manages its credit risk and estimates and measures expected credit losses. The IASB received feedback that a number of the disclosure requirements in the 2013 Impairment Exposure Draft were operationally challenging. With this in mind, the IASB decided on a number of changes and clarifications to reduce the burden of compliance while still providing the information needed by the users of the financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
