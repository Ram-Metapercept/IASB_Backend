However, it may be less straightforward if the basis for determining the contractual cash flows changes after the initial recognition of the financial instrument, without an amendment to the contractual terms of that financial instrument&#x2014;for example, when, to effect the reform, the method for calculating the interest rate benchmark is altered. Although the contractual terms of the financial instrument may not be amended, such a change in the method for calculating the interest rate benchmark may change the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of that financial instrument compared to the prior basis (ie the basis immediately preceding the change).</p></body></paragraph>
