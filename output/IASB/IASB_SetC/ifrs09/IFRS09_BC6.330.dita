Hence, the risk management objective for a particular hedging relationship could change even though an entity&#x2019;s risk management strategy remained unchanged. The IASB&#x2019;s intention was to prohibit voluntary discontinuation of hedge accounting when the risk management objective at the level of a particular hedging relationship (ie not only the risk management strategy) remained the same and all other qualifying criteria were still met. </p></body></paragraph>
