Some agreed with the restriction and the IASB&#x2019;s rationale for retaining it. Others were concerned that the restriction was inconsistent with common risk management practices. Those who disagreed believed that it should be possible to designate as the hedged item a benchmark risk component that is equivalent to the entire LIBOR and to treat the spread between the entire LIBOR and the contractual rate as a negative residual component. Their view reflects the fact that they are hedging their exposure to the variability of cash flows attributable to LIBOR (or a correlated index) using LIBOR swaps (see <xref id="IFRS09_X2947" base="F71871467" href="IFRS09_BC6.226.dita#IFRS09_BC6.226">paragraph BC6.226</xref> for an example). In their view, the IASB&#x2019;s proposal would not allow them to properly reflect the hedging relationship, and would force them to recognise hedge ineffectiveness that, in their view, would not reflect their risk management strategy.</p></body></paragraph>
