The requirements eliminate the threshold for recognising credit losses so that it would no longer be necessary for a credit event to have occurred before credit losses are recognised. Instead, expected credit losses and changes in expected credit losses are always recognised. In particular, IFRS 9 will require:</p> <ol base="F33205238" id="IFRS09_L0410" type="lower-roman"><li><li_value>(i)</li_value> <p base="F33205239" id="IFRS09_P7464">earlier recognition of lifetime expected credit losses for financial instruments relative to IAS 39 (ie instruments with a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition); and</p></li><li><li_value>(ii)</li_value> <p base="F33205241" id="IFRS09_P7465">in addition, 12-month expected credit losses for all other instruments. The amount of expected credit losses will be updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition. Consequently, the impairment model in IFRS 9 will be more responsive to changes in economic circumstances that affect credit risk.</p></li></ol></li><li><li_value>(d)</li_value> <p base="F33205243" id="IFRS09_P7466">the requirements broaden the information that an entity is required to consider when accounting for credit losses. An entity is required to base its measurement of expected credit losses on relevant information about past events, including historical credit loss information for similar financial instruments, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Thus, the effects of future credit loss expectations need to be considered. As a result of the broadening of the information that is required to be considered, the impairment model will be more forward looking.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
