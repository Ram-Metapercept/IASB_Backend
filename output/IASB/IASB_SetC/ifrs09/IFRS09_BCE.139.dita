The magnitude of the impact from the requirements in IFRS 9 depends on the financial instruments that an entity holds, when the financial instruments were originally recognised, how the entity has applied the <xref base="F71918864" href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001/IAS39_TOC0001_V3" id="IFRS09_X3333">IAS 39</xref> requirements, the sophistication of the entity&#x2019;s credit risk management systems and the availability of information about, for example, the probabilities of a default occurring, past due statuses and estimates of lifetime expected credit losses for all financial instruments (for example, products, geographical areas and vintages). While all entities will be required to meet the objective of the impairment requirements in <xref base="F71918898" href="IFRS09_g5.5.1-5.5.20.dita#IFRS09_g5.5.1-5.5.20/IFRS09_g5.5.1-5.5.20_TI" id="IFRS09_X3334">Section 5.5 of IFRS 9</xref>, in practice, the loss allowance will depend in part on how entities operationalise IFRS 9. The IASB is aware that entities across different jurisdictions have applied the existing impairment requirements in IAS 39 differently, in part as a result of the interaction with local or jurisdictional regulatory definitions and requirements.</p></body></paragraph>
