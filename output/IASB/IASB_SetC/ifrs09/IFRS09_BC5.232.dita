Before May 2010, <xref base="F71858972" href="../ifrs07/IFRS07_TOC.dita#IFRS07_TOC0001/IFRS07_TOC0001_V2" id="IFRS09_X2807">IFRS 7</xref> required the disclosure of the carrying amount of financial assets that would otherwise be past due or credit&#x2011;impaired but whose terms have been renegotiated. The IASB received feedback from constituents that it is operationally difficult to determine the purpose of modifications (ie whether they are performed for commercial or credit risk management reasons). The IASB noted in <xref base="F71858973" href="../ifrs07/IFRS07_gBC54A-BC54A.dita#IFRS07_gBC54A-BC54A/IFRS07_gBC54A-BC54A_TI" id="IFRS09_X2808">paragraph BC54A of IFRS 7</xref> the difficulty in identifying financial assets whose terms have been renegotiated for reasons other than credit reasons, especially when commercial terms of loans are often renegotiated regularly for reasons that are not related to impairment. This led the IASB to remove this requirement from <xref base="F71858974" href="../ifrs07/IFRS07_TOC.dita#IFRS07_TOC0001/IFRS07_TOC0001_V2" id="IFRS09_X2809">IFRS 7</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
