Specifically, the submission asked whether a debt instrument could have contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding if its contractual terms permit the borrower (ie the issuer) to prepay the instrument at an amount that could be more or less than unpaid amounts of principal and interest, such as at the instrument&#x2019;s current fair value or an amount that reflects the instrument&#x2019;s remaining contractual cash flows discounted at a current market interest rate.</p></body></paragraph>
