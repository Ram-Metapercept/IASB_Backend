This reflects feedback received that the accounting for financial liabilities has worked well in practice, except for the issue of own credit. However, IFRS 9 addresses the own credit issue by requiring the changes in fair value attributable to changes in the liability&#x2019;s credit risk to be recognised in other comprehensive income for financial liabilities that an entity elects to measure at fair value.</p></body></paragraph>
