This is because an entity&#x2019;s ability to conclude that the alternative benchmark rate meets the requirements in <xref href="IFRS09_6.3.7.dita" scope="local">paragraphs 6.3.7(a)</xref> and <xref href="IFRS09_B6.3.8.dita" scope="local">B6.3.8 of IFRS 9</xref> that a risk component must be separately identifiable and reliably measurable could be affected in the early stages of the reform.</p></body></paragraph>
