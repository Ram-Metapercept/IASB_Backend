Over time, exposures are either added or removed from the hedged portfolio resulting in what are generally called hedges of &#x2018;open positions&#x2019;. Hedges of open positions introduce significant complexity in the accounting model as the continuous changes in the hedged item need to be monitored and tracked for accounting purposes. The continuous changes in the hedged item also mean there is no direct one-to-one relationship with particular hedges.</p></body></paragraph>
