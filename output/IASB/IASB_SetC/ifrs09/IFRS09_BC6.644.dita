The IASB considered that IFRS 9 does not include specific requirements for the hypothetical derivative but mentions it as one possible way of calculating the change in the value of the hedged item to measure ineffectiveness (see <xref href="IFRS09_B6.5.5.dita" scope="local">paragraph B6.5.5 of IFRS 9</xref>). Therefore, the terms on which the hypothetical derivative is constructed replicate the hedged risk and the hedged cash flows of the hedged item an entity is hedging. The hypothetical derivative cannot include features in the value of the hedged item that exist only in the hedging instrument (but not in the hedged item). The IASB therefore decided that the identification of an appropriate hypothetical derivative is based on the requirements to measure hedge ineffectiveness and it would not be appropriate to include specific amendments for applying the requirements in paragraphs 6.9.9&#x2013;6.9.10 to the hypothetical derivative.</p></body></paragraph>
