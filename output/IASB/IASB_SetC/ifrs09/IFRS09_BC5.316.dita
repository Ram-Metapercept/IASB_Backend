As described in <xref href="IFRS09_5.4.8.dita">paragraph 5.4.8(a) of IFRS 9</xref>, an entity in such circumstances would not be required to do further analysis in order to determine that the economic equivalence condition has been satisfied (eg the entity would not be required to analyse whether the discounted present value of the cash flows of that financial instrument are substantially similar before and after the replacement).</p></body></paragraph>
