Some respondents asked for such treatment under IAS 39 to be &#x2018;grandfathered&#x2019;. The IASB noted that many such requests had been related to the proposed treatment of hybrid contracts with financial liability hosts, which were not included in IFRS 9 (2009). Consequently, the IASB decided not to permit an option to grandfather hybrid contracts with financial asset hosts that were bifurcated in accordance with IAS 39 as an accounting policy choice because it would impair comparability, and because some such contracts may still have a significant remaining maturity.</p></body></paragraph>
