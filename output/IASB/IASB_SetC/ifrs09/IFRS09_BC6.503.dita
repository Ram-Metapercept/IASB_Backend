Hence, the compensation received for credit risk depends on the fair value of the reference instrument. The IASB noted that, for a fixed-rate loan, the fair value of the reference instrument is also affected by changes in market interest rates. In other words, on settlement of the credit default swap, the entity also settles the fair value changes attributable to interest rate risk&#x2014;and not solely fair value changes attributable to the credit risk of the reference entity. Hence, the way credit default swaps are settled reflects that credit risk inextricably depends on interest rate risk. This in turn reflects that credit risk is an &#x2018;overlay&#x2019; risk that is affected by all other value changes of the hedged exposure because those value changes determine the value of what is lost in case of a default.</p></body></paragraph>
