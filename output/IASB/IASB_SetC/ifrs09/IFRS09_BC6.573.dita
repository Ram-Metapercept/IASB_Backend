Consequently, the IASB decided to propose amending <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 9</ph></ph> so that entities would not discontinue hedge accounting solely because the risk component is no longer separately identifiable as a result of the reform. In the 2019 Exposure Draft, the IASB proposed that the separately identifiable requirement for hedges of the benchmark component of interest rate risk be applied only at the inception of those hedging relationships affected by the reform. </p></body></paragraph>
