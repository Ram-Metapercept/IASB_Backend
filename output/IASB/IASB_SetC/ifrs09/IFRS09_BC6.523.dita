This is       because the premium for a credit default swap, or at least a large part of the premium, is       paid over time&#x2014;but only until a credit event occurs. The IASB noted that in order to       apply the same accounting as for the time value of options, the contingent nature of the       credit default swap premium would have to be ignored so that the amortisation of the premium       to profit or loss could be based on the assumption that no credit event occurs&#x2014;even       though that risk is reflected in the fair value of the credit default swap. The IASB also       noted that in substance this would be &#x2018;as-you-go&#x2019; accounting for the credit       default swap premium (ie  recognising it in profit or loss on an accrual basis).</p></body></paragraph>
