However, consistent with the IASB&#x2019;s objective for Phase 2 (see <xref href="IFRS09_BC5.290.dita" scope="local">paragraph BC5.290</xref>) and its objective for Phase 1 (see <xref href="IFRS09_BC6.550.dita" scope="local">paragraph BC6.550</xref>), the IASB considered that discontinuing hedge accounting solely due to the effects of the reform would not always reflect the economic effects of the changes required by the reform on a hedging relationship and therefore would not always provide useful information to users of financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
