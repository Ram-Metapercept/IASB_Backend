However, many objected to the label &#x2018;basic loan features&#x2019; and requested more guidance to apply the principle to particular financial assets. Respondents were also concerned that the 2009 Classification and Measurement Exposure Draft did not discuss &#x2018;immaterial&#x2019; or &#x2018;insignificant&#x2019; features that they believed ought not to affect classification.</p></body></paragraph>
