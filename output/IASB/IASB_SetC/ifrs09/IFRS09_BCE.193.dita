These restrictions made achieving hedge accounting for items managed as part of a net position under IAS 39 difficult in practice and made it necessary to designate gross positions instead of the net position that is being economically hedged. This created a disconnect between the accounting and the actual risk management activity.</p></body></paragraph>
