The adjustment would be the change in the fair value of a credit default swap that matches the maturity of the hedged credit exposure (&#x2018;aligned&#x2019; credit default swap value). The mechanics of this would be similar to how, in a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the hedged item that is attributable to a risk component adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged item and is recognised in profit or loss. Essentially, the cumulative change in the fair value of the aligned credit default swap would be deemed to be the credit risk component of the exposure in a fair value hedge of credit risk (ie act as a proxy for credit risk&#x2014;&#x2018;deemed credit adjustment&#x2019;). When the deemed credit adjustment approach is discontinued before the credit exposure matures an accounting treatment that is similar to that used for discontinued fair value hedges could be used.</p></body></paragraph>
