However, the IASB acknowledged that because of differences in the approach to the reform applied in different jurisdictions, and differences in timing, implementing the reform could require more than one change to the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or a financial liability. This could be the case, for example, when a central authority, as the administrator of an interest rate benchmark, undertakes a multi-step process to replace an interest rate benchmark with an alternative benchmark rate. As each change to the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of the instrument is made as required by the reform, an entity would be required to apply the Phase 2 amendments to account for that change.</p></body></paragraph>
