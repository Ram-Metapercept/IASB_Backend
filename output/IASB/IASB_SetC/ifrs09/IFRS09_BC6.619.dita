The IASB considered that the conditions in <xref href="IFRS09_5.4.7.dita" scope="local">paragraph 5.4.7 of IFRS 9</xref>&#x2014;ie the change is necessary as a direct consequence of the reform and is done on economically equivalent basis&#x2014;are helpful in analysing the amendments to the contractual terms of derivatives described in <xref href="IFRS09_BC6.618.dita" scope="local">paragraph BC6.618</xref>. In this context, the IASB noted that if these other approaches result in derivatives with substantially different terms from those of the original derivative, the change may not have been made on an economically equivalent basis. The IASB also noted that if a hedging instrument is derecognised, hedge accounting is required to be discontinued. Therefore, the IASB decided that for hedge accounting to continue it is also necessary that the original hedging instrument would not be derecognised.</p></body></paragraph>
