Ms McConnell could accept accounting for changes in fair value of some instruments outside profit or loss in other comprehensive income. However, that treatment should not be a free choice; criteria for that presentation should be developed. In addition, the Board decided that when those securities are sold any realised gains and losses are not &#x2018;reclassified&#x2019; to profit or loss. That conclusion is inconsistent with the Board&#x2019;s decision to report dividends received on these investments in profit or loss. Such dividends represent a return on investment or a form of &#x2018;reclassifying&#x2019; changes in the value of the instruments.</p></body></paragraph>
