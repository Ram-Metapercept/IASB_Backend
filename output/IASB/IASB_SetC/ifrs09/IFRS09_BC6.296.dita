Consequently, the IASB agreed that the foreign currency basis spread could be subsumed under the notion of &#x2018;costs of hedging&#x2019; that it had developed for the accounting for the time value of options and the forward element of forward contracts. The IASB therefore decided to expand the notion of &#x2018;costs of hedging&#x2019; so as to include foreign currency basis spreads. In the IASB&#x2019;s view, this would provide the most transparent accounting, reflect best the economics of the transaction and fit into the new hedge accounting model.</p></body></paragraph>
