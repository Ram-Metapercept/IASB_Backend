Acknowledging that different entities in different jurisdictions would implement the reform differently, the IASB did not require a particular approach for assessing this condition. The IASB noted that because it set no &#x2018;bright lines&#x2019;, an entity is required to apply judgement to assess whether circumstances meet the economic equivalence condition. For example, assuming that the entity determines that replacing an interest rate benchmark with an alternative benchmark rate is necessary for the affected financial instrument as a direct consequence of the reform (ie the condition in <xref href="IFRS09_5.4.7.dita">paragraph 5.4.7(a) of IFRS 9</xref> is met), the entity determines:</p><ol type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>         <p>what alternative benchmark rate will replace the interest rate benchmark and whether a fixed spread adjustment is necessary to compensate for a basis difference between the alternative benchmark rate and the interest rate benchmark preceding replacement. The entity would assess the overall resulting cash flows, including amounts relating to interest (ie alternative benchmark rate plus any fixed spread adjustment), to determine whether the economic equivalence condition is met. In other words, in this example, the entity would assess whether the interest rate remained substantially similar before and after the replacementâ€•specifically, whether the interest rate after replacement (eg the alternative benchmark rate plus the fixed spread) was substantially similar to the interest rate benchmark immediately preceding the replacement; and</p>       </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>         <p>	whether the alternative benchmark rate (plus the necessary fixed spread described in <xref href="IFRS09_BC5.315.dita">paragraph BC5.315(a)</xref>) was applied to the relevant affected financial instrument(s).</p>       </li></ol></body></paragraph>
