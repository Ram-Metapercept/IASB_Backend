The changes in fair value of the credit default swaps are recognised in profit or loss in every reporting period (as for a trading book). The accounting outcome is an accounting mismatch of gains and losses of the loans and loan commitments versus those of the credit default swaps, which creates volatility in profit or loss. During the IASB&#x2019;s outreach programme, many users of financial statements pointed out that that outcome does not reflect the economic substance of the credit risk management strategy of financial institutions.</p></body></paragraph>
