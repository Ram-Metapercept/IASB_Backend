Proponents of this approach indicated that such an approach might minimise abuse of the reclassification requirements and result in more instruments being measured at fair value. However, in the IASB&#x2019;s view, there is no conceptual reason to require reclassification in one direction but not the other.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
