Paragraph B4.3.8(b) of IFRS 9 states:</p><lq> <p base="F33205433" id="IFRS09_P5768">An embedded floor or cap on the interest rate on a debt contract or insurance contract is closely related to the host contract, provided the cap is at or above the market rate of interest and the floor is at or below the market rate of interest <i>when the contract is issued</i>, and the cap or floor is not leveraged in relation to the host contract. Similarly, provisions included in a contract to purchase or sell an asset (eg a commodity) that establish a cap and a floor on the price to be paid or received for the asset are closely related to the host contract if both the cap and floor were out of the <i>money at inception</i> and are not leveraged.
