Despite the objective of the project to represent, in the financial statements, the effect of an entity&#x2019;s risk management activities, the IASB considered that this would in many situations not be possible as a simple, exact &#x2018;1:1 copy&#x2019; of the actual risk management perspective. In the IASB&#x2019;s view this was already apparent from other aspects of the hedge accounting model of IFRS 9, for example:</p><ol id="IFRS09_L0306" base="F33206435" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P6474" base="F33206436">the mere fact that the IASB had limited net position cash flow hedges to foreign currency risk meant that for all other types of hedged risks an entity would have to designate gross amounts (gross designation). But this did not mean that cash flow hedge accounting was prohibited for all other risks that are managed on a net position basis.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P6475" base="F33206448">an entity that actually hedges on a risk component basis in accordance with its risk management view might not meet the criteria for designating the hedged item as a risk component. But this did not mean that the entity was prohibited from applying hedge accounting altogether. Instead, it was only prohibited from using that particular designation of a risk component. Consequently, the entity could designate the item in its entirety as the hedged item and apply hedge accounting (if it met the qualifying criteria on the basis of that designation).</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P6476" base="F33206450">for many entities the actual risk management is based on a &#x2018;flow perspective&#x2019; for cash flow hedges, which only considers mismatches in the variable cash flows of the hedging instrument and the hedged item as a source of hedge ineffectiveness. However, the measurement of hedge effectiveness for hedge accounting purposes does not allow an entity to assume perfect hedge effectiveness in those circumstances (or limiting the analysis to only the variable cash flows of the hedging instrument). However, this did not mean that hedge accounting was prohibited. Instead, it meant that the entity had to measure hedge ineffectiveness as required for accounting purposes.</p></li><li><li_value>(d)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P6477" base="F33206452">the presentation of hedges of net positions requires the use of a separate line item in the income statement instead of directly adjusting the line items affected by the hedged items (for example, grossing up revenue and cost of sales). In contrast, entities&#x2019; actual risk management often considers the respective line items as hedged at the respective rates that were locked in by the hedges. This difference between the risk management and accounting views did not mean that an entity was prohibited from using hedge accounting. Instead, it meant that the entity had to follow the presentation requirements for accounting purposes if it wanted to apply hedge accounting.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
