Interest rate benchmark       reform could affect this assessment for hedging relationships that may extend beyond the       timing of the reform. That is because entities would have to consider possible changes to the       fair value or future cash flows of hedged items and hedging instruments to assess whether an       economic relationship continues to exist between the hedged item and hedging instrument.       Consequently, at some point in time, it is possible that entities would not be able to       demonstrate the existence of an economic relationship solely because of uncertainties arising       from the reform.</p></body></paragraph>
