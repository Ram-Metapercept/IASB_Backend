Consequently, the length of time that preparers and users of financial statements would be dealing with a variety of complex alternatives related to the accounting for financial instruments is also open-ended. Mr Finnegan believes that this outcome conflicts with the Board&#x2019;s stated goal of making timely improvements to simplify such accounting.</p></body></paragraph>
