The IASB considered that if an entity concludes for one       hedging relationship that it no longer has a reasonable expectation that the alternative       benchmark rate would meet the requirements within the 24&#x2011;month period, it is likely that the       entity would reach the same conclusion for all other hedging relationships in which that       particular alternative benchmark rate has been designated. Applying this requirement to the       example in <xref href="IFRS09_BC6.654.dita" scope="local">paragraph BC6.654</xref>, the       24&#x2011;month period will begin on 31 March 20X1 for that alternative benchmark rate.</p></body></paragraph>
