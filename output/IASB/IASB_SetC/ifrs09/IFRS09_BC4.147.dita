The IASB decided that such sales should be assessed in the same manner as other sales. Specifically, an entity must assess whether the assets&#x2019; credit risk has increased (based on reasonable and supportable, including forward looking, information) and, if so, such sales would be consistent with a hold to collect business model. If not, the entity would need to consider the frequency, value and timing of such sales, as well as the reasons for those sales, to determine whether they are consistent with a hold to collect business model. The IASB noted that the notion of credit concentration risk is applied fairly broadly in practice and may include changes in the entity&#x2019;s investment policy or strategy that are not related to credit deterioration. The IASB noted that frequent sales that are significant in value and labelled as &#x2018;due to credit concentration risk&#x2019; (but that are not related to an increase in the assets&#x2019; credit risk) are likely to be inconsistent with the objective of collecting contractual cash flows.</p></body></paragraph>
