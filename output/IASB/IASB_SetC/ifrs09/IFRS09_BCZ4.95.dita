It decided that a foreign currency derivative in a contract should not be required to be separated if it is denominated in a currency that is commonly used in business transactions (that are not financial instruments) in the environment in which the transaction takes place (that guidance is now in IFRS 9). A foreign currency derivative would be viewed as closely related to the host contract if the currency is commonly used in local business transactions, for example, when monetary amounts are viewed by the general population not in terms of the local currency but in terms of a relatively stable foreign currency, and prices may be quoted in that foreign currency (see <xref base="F71850262" href="../ias29/IAS29_TOC0001.dita#IAS29_TOC0001" id="IFRS09_X2440"><ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 29</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies</ph></ph></xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
