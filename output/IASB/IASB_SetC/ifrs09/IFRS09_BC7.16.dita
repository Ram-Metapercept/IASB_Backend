Moreover, an entity will not have the necessary information to determine fair value retrospectively without using hindsight. However, an entity would have been required to measure both the embedded derivative and host separately at fair value to apply the disclosure requirements in <xref base="F71888193" href="../ifrs07/IFRS07_TOC.dita#IFRS07_TOC0001/IFRS07_TOC0001_V2" id="IFRS09_X3164">IFRS 7</xref>. Consequently, in comparative periods, IFRS 9 requires the sum of the fair value of the embedded derivative and the host to be used as an approximation of the fair value of the entire hybrid contract.</p></body></paragraph>
