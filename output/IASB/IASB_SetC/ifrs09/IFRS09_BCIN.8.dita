Thus, in May 2010, the IASB published the Exposure Draft <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Fair Value Option for Financial Liabilities</ph></ph> (the &#x2018;2010 Own Credit Risk Exposure Draft&#x2019;), which proposed that the effects of changes in the credit risk of liabilities designated under the fair value option would be presented in other comprehensive income. The IASB considered the responses to the 2010 Own Credit Risk Exposure Draft and finalised the requirements, which were then added to <xref base="F71835414" href="IFRS09_TOC.dita#IFRS09_TOC0001" id="IFRS09_X2184">IFRS 9</xref> in October 2010.</p></body></paragraph>
