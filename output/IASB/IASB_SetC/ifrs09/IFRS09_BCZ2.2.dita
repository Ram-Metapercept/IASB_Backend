In the IAS 39 implementation guidance process, the question was raised whether a bank&#x2019;s loan commitments are derivatives accounted for at fair value under <xref base="F71843763" href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001/IAS39_TOC0001_V3" id="IFRS09_X2197">IAS 39</xref>. This question arises because a commitment to make a loan at a specified rate of interest during a fixed period of time meets the definition of a derivative. In effect, it is a written option for the potential borrower to obtain a loan at a specified rate.</p></body></paragraph>
