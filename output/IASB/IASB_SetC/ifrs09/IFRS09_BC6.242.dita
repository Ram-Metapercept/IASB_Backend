Those respondents were concerned that the requirements, as drafted in the 2010 Hedge Accounting Exposure Draft, could be interpreted to be more restrictive and onerous than the bright line effectiveness test in <xref base="F71871545" href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001/IAS39_TOC0001_V3" id="IFRS09_X2965">IAS 39</xref> and would be inconsistent with risk management practice. More specifically, those respondents were concerned that the objective of the hedge effectiveness assessment as drafted in the 2010 Hedge Accounting Exposure Draft could be interpreted as requiring entities to set up a hedging relationship that was &#x2018;perfectly effective&#x2019;. They were concerned that this would result in an effectiveness assessment that would be based on a bright line of 100 per cent effectiveness, and that such an approach:</p><ol base="F33207070" id="IFRS09_L0326" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p base="F33207071" id="IFRS09_P6681">would not take into account that, in many situations, entities do not use a hedging instrument that would make the hedging relationship &#x2018;perfectly effective&#x2019;. They noted that entities use hedging instruments that do not achieve perfect hedge effectiveness because the &#x2018;perfect&#x2019; hedging instrument is:</p> <ol base="F33207075" id="IFRS09_L0327" type="lower-roman"><li><li_value>(i)</li_value> <p base="F33207076" id="IFRS09_P6682">not available; or</p></li><li><li_value>(ii)</li_value> <p base="F33207088" id="IFRS09_P6683">not cost-effective as a hedge (compared to a standardised instrument that is cheaper and/or more liquid, but does not provide the perfect fit).</p></li></ol></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p base="F33207073" id="IFRS09_P6684">could be interpreted as a mathematical optimisation exercise. In other words, they were concerned that it would require entities to search for the perfect hedging relationship at inception (and on a continuous basis), because if they did not, the results could be considered to be biased and hedge ineffectiveness would probably not be &#x2018;minimised&#x2019;. </p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
