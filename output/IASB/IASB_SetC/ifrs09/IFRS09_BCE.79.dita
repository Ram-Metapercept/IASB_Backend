Given that the new classification model for financial assets is based on the entity&#x2019;s business model for managing its financial assets and those assets&#x2019; contractual cash flow characteristics, it is reasonable to conclude that the costs incurred and the benefits obtained in complying with the new requirements will depend on the entity&#x2019;s business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of its financial assets.</p></body></paragraph>
