Given that the new model is based on an entity&#x2019;s risk management practices, it is reasonable to conclude that one of the key drivers of the costs incurred and the benefits obtained, in complying with the new requirements, will be the level of development and the sophistication of the entities&#x2019; risk management functions.</p></body></paragraph>
