This could include, for example, designating a basis swap as a new hedging instrument to mitigate ineffectiveness arising from the difference between the compounding of the alternative benchmark rates used for cash products and derivatives. These respondents asked the IASB to permit such changes to be in the scope of the required changes to the hedging relationship set out in <xref href="IFRS09_6.9.1.dita" scope="local">paragraph 6.9.1 of IFRS 9</xref>. The IASB however decided not to extend the scope of paragraph 6.9.1 of IFRS 9 to other changes an entity makes as a result of the reform. The IASB considered that its objective for the Phase 2 amendments is not only to support entities in applying the IFRS requirements during the transition to alternative benchmark rates, but also to provide users of financial statements with useful information about the effect of the reform on an entity&#x2019;s financial statements. To balance achieving this objective with maintaining the discipline that exists in the hedge accounting requirements in IFRS 9, the IASB limited the scope of the changes required to the designation of hedging relationships to only those changes that are necessary to reflect the changes required by the reform (as described in <xref href="IFRS09_5.4.6.dita" scope="local">paragraphs 5.4.6&#x2013;5.4.8 of IFRS 9</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
