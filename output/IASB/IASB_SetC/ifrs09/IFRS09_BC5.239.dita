In the IASB&#x2019;s view, this faithfully represents the economics of the transaction and it should not override that faithful representation for anti-abuse purposes. In addition, the IASB observed that entities also modify financial instruments for reasons other than increases in credit risk and, therefore, it would be difficult from an operational standpoint to prescribe asymmetrical guidance only for financial assets that have been modified because of credit risk factors (see <xref id="IFRS09_X2816" base="F71859016" href="IFRS09_gBC5.227-BC5.241.dita#IFRS09_gBC5.227-BC5.241/IFRS09_gBC5.227-BC5.241_TI">paragraphs BC5.227&#x2013;BC5.235</xref>) .</p></body></paragraph>
