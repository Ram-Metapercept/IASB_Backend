More specifically, at the request of the Interpretations Committee, the Board discussed whether, applying IFRS 9, an entity recognises any adjustment to the amortised cost of the financial liability arising from such a modification or exchange in profit or loss at the date of the modification or exchange.</p></body></paragraph>
