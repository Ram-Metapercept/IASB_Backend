The IASB noted that the requirement to discontinue hedge accounting meant that although an entity could designate the new derivative as the hedging instrument in a new hedging relationship, this could result in more hedge ineffectiveness, especially for cash flow hedges, compared to a continuing hedging relationship. This is because the derivative that would be newly designated as the hedging instrument would be on terms that would be different from a new derivative, ie it was unlikely to be &#x2018;at-market&#x2019; (for example, a non-option derivative such as a swap or forward might have a significant fair value) at the time of the novation.</p></body></paragraph>
