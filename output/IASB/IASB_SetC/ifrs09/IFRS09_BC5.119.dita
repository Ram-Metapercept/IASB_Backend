To achieve that objective, <xref id="IFRS09_X2708" base="F71856753" href="IFRS09_g5.7.10-5.7.11.dita#IFRS09_g5.7.10-5.7.11/IFRS09_g5.7.10-5.7.11_TI">paragraph 5.7.10 of IFRS 9</xref> requires an entity to calculate interest revenue and impairment gains or losses in a manner that is consistent with the requirements that are applicable to financial assets measured at amortised cost. Thus, the IASB decided that the requirements for the recognition and measurement of expected credit losses shall apply to the fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category, in the same way as for assets measured at amortised cost. However, the loss allowance is recognised in other comprehensive income instead of reducing the carrying amount of the financial asset in the statement of financial position. </p></body></paragraph>
