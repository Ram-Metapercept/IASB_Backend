However, the amendment does not specify the alternative benchmark rate, or the spread       adjustment between the interest rate benchmark and the alternative benchmark rate, on which       the cash flows will be based. In this scenario, by amending the contract to include this       clause, uncertainty regarding the timing has been eliminated but uncertainty about the amount       remains.</p></body></paragraph>
