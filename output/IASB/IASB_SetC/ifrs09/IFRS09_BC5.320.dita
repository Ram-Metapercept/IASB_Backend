Therefore, considering the objective of Phase 2, the IASB made no amendments for these matters. Specific to <xref href="IFRS09_BC5.319.dita">paragraph BC5.319(f)</xref>, the IASB observed that the practical expedient in <xref href="IFRS09_5.4.7.dita">paragraph 5.4.7 of IFRS 9</xref> would apply to such a host contract if the conditions set out in paragraph 5.4.7 of IFRS 9 are met.</p></body></paragraph>
