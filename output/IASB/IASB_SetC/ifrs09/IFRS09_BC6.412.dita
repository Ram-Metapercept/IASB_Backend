They noted that time value was subject to &#x2018;time decay&#x2019; and that both the purchased and the written option would lose their time value over time as the collar approaches expiry. They argued that the time value of zero-cost collars should also be recognised in other comprehensive income during the life of the hedging relationship. They considered it unjustified to limit the proposed accounting to options that have an initial time value of greater than nil, given that one of the main concerns being addressed by the proposal was the volatility resulting from changes in the time value over the life of the hedge.</p></body></paragraph>
