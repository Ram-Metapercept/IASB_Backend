Consequently, estimating expected credit losses over the relevant period of time it takes for an event to happen and for the effects to be known, may have conceptual merit. However, the IASB noted that &#x2018;emergence&#x2019; notions fit more naturally in an incurred loss model in which it is difficult to identify when a loss has been incurred on individual instruments.</p></body></paragraph>
