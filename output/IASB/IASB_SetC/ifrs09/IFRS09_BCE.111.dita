Despite the concerns about the application of judgement, in the IASB&#x2019;s view, the new impairment model will improve the comparability of reported amounts. This is because under the incurred loss model in accordance with <xref base="F71918855" href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001/IAS39_TOC0001_V3" id="IFRS09_X3323">IAS 39</xref>, increases in credit risk are not reported in the absence of a loss event, which limited the comparability of the reported amounts and the effective return on the financial assets. In addition, in practice, the point at which losses were considered to be incurred varied between entities.</p></body></paragraph>
