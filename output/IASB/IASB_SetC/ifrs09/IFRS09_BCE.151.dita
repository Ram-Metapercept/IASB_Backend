However, the financial assets that are credit&#x2011;impaired will be a subset of the financial assets for which lifetime expected credit losses are recognised in accordance with IFRS 9. In addition, because the criteria listed for an instrument to be credit&#x2011;impaired are the same as the existing incurred loss criteria in IAS 39 (except for the exclusion of &#x2018;incurred but not reported&#x2019;), the IASB believes that the application of these concepts should result in minimal change in practice and will therefore have no significant cost implications for existing IFRS preparers.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS09_FN0145" type="fn"/></p></body></paragraph>
