The IASB concluded that the most useful information would be provided to users of financial statements if requirements for recognition and measurement of hedge ineffectiveness remain unchanged (see <xref href="IFRS09_BC6.567.dita" scope="local">paragraph BC6.567</xref>). This is because recognising ineffectiveness in the financial statements based on the actual results of a hedging relationship faithfully represents the economic effects of the reform, thereby providing useful information to users of financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
