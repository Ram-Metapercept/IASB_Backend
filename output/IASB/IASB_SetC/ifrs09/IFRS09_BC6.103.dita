This scope exception would be separate from that for fair value hedge accounting for a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk, which complements the hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9 and which the IASB had already proposed in the 2010 Hedge Accounting Exposure Draft (see <xref base="F71859264" href="IFRS09_BC6.88.dita#IFRS09_BC6.88" id="IFRS09_X2871">paragraph BC6.88</xref>). In this case the IASB considered whether there was a need to allow entities to continue to apply <xref base="F71859265" href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001/IAS39_TOC0001_V3" id="IFRS09_X2872">IAS 39</xref> to cash flow hedges in the context of macro hedging activities. In the IASB&#x2019;s view it was not necessary from a technical perspective to make any changes in addition to the clarifications that it had already provided (see <xref base="F71859266" href="IFRS09_BC6.93.dita#IFRS09_BC6.93" id="IFRS09_X2873">paragraphs BC6.93&#x2013;BC6.101</xref>). However, the IASB acknowledged that it had not yet completed its project on accounting for macro hedging and that providing a choice to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements in IAS 39 would allow entities to wait for the complete picture related to the accounting for hedging activities before applying a new hedge accounting model.</p></body></paragraph>
