Accordingly, the fair value of a financial liability reflects the credit risk relating to that liability. Consequently, it decided to include credit risk relating to a financial liability in the fair value measurement of that liability for the following reasons:</p><ol id="IFRS09_L0273" base="F33207595" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P6053" base="F33207608">Entities realise changes in fair value, including fair value attributable to the liability&#x2019;s credit risk, for example, by renegotiating or repurchasing liabilities or by using derivatives.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P6054" base="F33207610">Changes in credit risk affect the observed market price of a financial liability and hence its fair value.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P6055" base="F33207612">It is difficult from a practical standpoint to exclude changes in credit risk from an observed market price.</p></li><li><li_value>(d)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P6056" base="F33207614">The fair value of a financial liability (ie the price of that liability in an exchange between a knowledgeable, willing buyer and a knowledgeable, willing seller) on initial recognition reflects its credit risk. The IASB believes that it is inappropriate to include credit risk in the initial fair value measurement of financial liabilities, but not subsequently.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
