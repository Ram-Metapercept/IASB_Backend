It is therefore difficult to generalise the likely impact of costs on preparers. Broadly, the IASB expects:</p><ol base="F33205807" id="IFRS09_L0416" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p base="F33205809" id="IFRS09_P7623">entities with more sophisticated risk management functions, that produce reliable information for the entity&#x2019;s own management, will have costs of initial application in establishing better links between those functions and their accounting function, but the ongoing costs of application should then be lower because of the new hedge effectiveness test.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p base="F33205811" id="IFRS09_P7624">entities that have embedded hedge accounting in their accounting systems may have to adjust their systems, depending on the particular implementation of <xref base="F71919095" href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001/IAS39_TOC0001_V3" id="IFRS09_X3371">IAS 39</xref> and what additional new accounting treatments the entity wants to use. Entities using bespoke or self-developed solutions are affected differently from those using standard software. In all cases, the costs are one-off transition costs.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p base="F33205813" id="IFRS09_P7625">entities that use a master documentation approach, whereby the documentation of individual hedging relationships includes references to master documents that set out risk management strategies or effectiveness testing methods, will have lower costs of making the transition than entities that include that information in full in the documentation of each individual hedging relationship. Those costs are also one-off transition costs.</p></li><li><li_value>(d)</li_value> <p base="F33205816" id="IFRS09_P7626">the new disclosure requirements will result in the need to capture more data than under the current hedge accounting disclosures in IAS 39. Costs arise on transition when the capability to provide those disclosures is created but will also include ongoing costs. However, if entities embed this in their systems that they use for preparing their financial statements the ongoing costs can be significantly reduced.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
