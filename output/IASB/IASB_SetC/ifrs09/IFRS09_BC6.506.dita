This approach could be based on the guidance in <xref base="F71882604" href="../ifrs07/IFRS07_TOC.dita#IFRS07_TOC0001/IFRS07_TOC0001_V2" id="IFRS09_X3098">IFRS 7</xref> and IFRS 9 for the measurement of an entity&#x2019;s own credit risk on financial liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss. Those respondents noted that if this method of determining own credit risk for such liabilities is acceptable in IFRS 7 and IFRS 9, the IASB should provide the same &#x2018;relief&#x2019; for measuring the credit risk component for the purposes of hedge accounting.</p></body></paragraph>
