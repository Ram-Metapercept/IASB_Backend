The IASB obtained information and views from its Financial Instruments Working Group (FIWG) and from users of financial statements, regulators, preparers, auditors and others from a range of industries across different geographical regions. The primary messages that the IASB received were that the requirements in <xref base="F71835412" href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001/IAS39_TOC0001_V3" id="IFRS09_X2182">IAS 39</xref> for classifying and measuring financial liabilities were generally working well but that the effects of the changes in a liability&#x2019;s credit risk ought not to affect profit or loss unless the liability is held for trading. As a result of the feedback received, the IASB decided to retain almost all of the requirements in IAS 39 for the classification and measurement of financial liabilities and carry them forward to IFRS 9 (see <xref base="F71835413" href="IFRS09_gBC4.46-BC4.53.dita#IFRS09_gBC4.46-BC4.53/IFRS09_gBC4.46-BC4.53_TI" id="IFRS09_X2183">paragraphs BC4.46&#x2013;BC4.53</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
