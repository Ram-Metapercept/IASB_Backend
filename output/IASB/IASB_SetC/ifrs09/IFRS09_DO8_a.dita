In his view, of the three courses of action open to the Board&#x2014;retaining IAS 39&#x2019;s requirement to use basis adjustment, prohibiting basis adjustment as proposed in the June 2002 Exposure Draft,<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS09_FN0153" type="fn"/> or providing a choice&#x2014;the Board has selected the worst course. Mr Cope believes that the best approach would have been to prohibit basis adjustment, as proposed in the Exposure Draft, because, in his opinion, basis adjustments result in the recognition of assets and liabilities at inappropriate amounts.</p></body></paragraph>
