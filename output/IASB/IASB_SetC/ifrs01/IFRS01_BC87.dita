Some respondents to ED 1 noted that some regulators require entities to prepare more than two years of comparatives. They argued the following: </p><ol id="IFRS01_L0161" base="F7283789" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS01_P2900" base="F7283790">A requirement to restate two years of comparatives would impose excessive costs and lead to arbitrary restatements that might be biased by hindsight.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS01_P2901" base="F7283792">Consider an entity adopting IFRSs in 2005 and required by its regulator to give two years of comparatives. Its date of transition to IFRSs would be 1 January 2003&#x2014;several months before the publication of the IFRS and of the standards resulting from the improvements project. This could contradict the Board&#x2019;s assertion in <xref id="IFRS01_X1825" base="F15825410" href="IFRS01_BC27.dita#IFRS01_BC27">paragraph BC27</xref> above that most preparers could gather most information they need for their opening IFRS balance sheet at, or soon after, the date of transition to IFRSs.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
