Some argued that this would be a practical way for a first&#x2011;time adopter to give a high level of transparency and comparability, without incurring the cost of investigating very old transactions. They noted two particular precedents for transitional provisions that have permitted an entity to omit some assets and liabilities from its balance sheet:</p>       <ol base="F64420759" type="lower-alpha" id="IFRS01_L0128"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>           <p base="F64420761" id="IFRS01_P2627">A previous version of IAS 39 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement</ph></ph><xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS01_FN0016" type="fn"/> prohibited restatement of securitisation, transfer or other derecognition transactions entered into before the beginning of the financial year in which it was initially applied.</p>         </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>           <p base="F64420765" id="IFRS01_P2628">Some national accounting standards and IAS 17 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Accounting for Leases</ph></ph> (superseded in 1997 by IAS 17 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Leases</ph></ph>) permitted prospective application of a requirement for lessees to capitalise finance leases. Under this approach, a lessee would not be required to recognise finance lease obligations and the related leased assets for leases that began before a specified date.</p>         </li></ol>     </variant></body></paragraph>
