These factors could reduce the relevance and reliability of the entity&#x2019;s first IFRS financial statements. Therefore, ED 1 would have prohibited restatement of past business combinations (unless an entity used the proposed alternative approach, discussed in <xref base="F15824866" href="IFRS01_BC15.dita#IFRS01_BC15" id="IFRS01_X1688">paragraph BC15</xref>, of applying IFRSs as if it had always applied IFRSs). Some respondents agreed, arguing that restatement of past business combinations would involve subjective, and potentially selective, use of hindsight that would diminish the relevance and reliability of financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
