Thus, IAS 34 requires less disclosure in interim financial statements than IFRSs require in annual financial statements. However, an entity&#x2019;s interim financial report in accordance with IAS 34 is less helpful to users if the entity&#x2019;s latest annual financial statements were prepared using previous GAAP than if they were prepared in accordance with IFRSs. Therefore, the Board concluded that a first&#x2011;time adopter&#x2019;s first interim financial report in accordance with IAS 34 should include sufficient information to enable users to understand how the transition to IFRSs affected previously reported annual, as well as interim, figures (<xref id="IFRS01_X1849" base="F15825453" href="IFRS01_g32-33.dita#IFRS01_g32-33">paragraphs 32 and 33</xref> of the IFRS).</p></body></paragraph>
