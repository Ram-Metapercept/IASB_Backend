Each such exemption would have moved the IFRS away from a principle&#x2011;based approach, diminished transparency for users, decreased comparability over time within an entity&#x2019;s first IFRS financial statements and created additional complexity. In the Board&#x2019;s view, any cost savings generated would not have outweighed these disadvantages. <xref id="IFRS01_X1782" base="F15825290" href="IFRS01_gBC65-BC66.dita#IFRS01_gBC65-BC66">Paragraphs BC65&#x2013;BC73</xref> discuss some of the specific suggestions the Board considered for embedded derivatives, hyperinflation, intangible assets and transaction costs on financial instruments.</p></body></paragraph>
