The Board concluded that the cost and effort required to achieve total compliance in this area for the purposes of preparing an entity&#x2019;s first IFRS financial statements is not warranted to meet the objective of providing a suitable starting point for accounting under IFRSs. IFRS 1 requires that each item for which the exemption is used is tested for impairment, either individually or at the cash&#x2011;generating unit to which the item belongs in accordance with <xref base="F15825052" href="../ias36/IAS36_TOC0001.dita#IAS36_TOC0001" id="IFRS01_X1713">IAS 36</xref>, at the date of transition. This requirement provides further assurance that this objective is met.</p></body></paragraph>
