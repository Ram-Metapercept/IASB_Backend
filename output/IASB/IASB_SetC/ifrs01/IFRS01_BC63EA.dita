Interested parties found it unclear whether borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with previous GAAP should be retained, restated or eliminated in the opening statement of financial position. Interested parties also questioned the accounting, after the date of transition, for borrowing costs that relate to such qualifying assets when these qualifying assets are under construction at the date of transition. They wanted clarification as to whether the first-time adopter should apply the requirements of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 23</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Borrowing Costs</ph></ph> or whether it should continue applying its previous GAAP even if that previous GAAP is not consistent with IAS 23.</p></body></paragraph>
