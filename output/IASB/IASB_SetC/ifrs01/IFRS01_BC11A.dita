Notwithstanding the advantages, set out in <xref id="IFRS01_X1614" base="F28976026" href="IFRS01_BC11.dita#IFRS01_BC11/IFRS01_BC11_V2">paragraph BC11</xref>, of applying a more recent version of an IFRS, paragraphs 7&#x2013;8 permit an entity to use either the IFRS that is currently mandatory or the new IFRS that is not yet mandatory, if that new IFRS permits early application. Paragraph 7 requires an entity to apply the same version of the IFRS throughout the periods covered by the entity&#x2019;s first IFRS financial statements. Consequently, if a first-time adopter chooses to early apply a new IFRS, that new IFRS will be applied throughout all the periods presented in its first IFRS financial statements on a retrospective basis, unless IFRS 1 provides an exemption or an exception that permits or requires otherwise.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
