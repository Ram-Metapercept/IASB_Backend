Accordingly, before the amendment that added <xref href="IFRS01_D13A.dita" scope="local">paragraph D13A</xref>, a subsidiary that became a first-time adopter later than its parent might have been required to keep two parallel sets of accounting records for cumulative translation differences based on different dates of transition to IFRSs. Following the rationale in <xref href="IFRS01_BC59.dita" scope="local">paragraphs BC59&#x2013;BC60</xref>, the Board decided to extend the exemption in paragraph D16(a) to cumulative translation differences to reduce costs for first-time adopters. The Board noted that IFRS 1 already provides an exemption relating to cumulative translation differences. Extending the exemption in paragraph D16(a) would therefore not diminish the relevance of information reported by a subsidiary that becomes a first-time adopter later than its parent.</p></body></paragraph>
