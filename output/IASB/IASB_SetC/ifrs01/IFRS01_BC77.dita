The Board confirmed in the Basis for Conclusions published with ED 1 that it did not intend the redrafting to create substantive changes. However, in the light of responses to ED 1, the Board decided in finalising IFRS 1 that the redrafting would not make it easier for first&#x2011;time adopters and others to understand and apply the transitional provisions and Q&amp;As. However, the project to improve IAS 32 and IAS 39 resulted in certain amendments to the transition requirements. In addition, this project incorporated selected other Q&amp;As (ie not on transition) into IAS 39. The Board therefore took this opportunity to consolidate all the guidance for first&#x2011;time adopters in one place, by incorporating the Q&amp;As on transition into IFRS 1.</p></body></paragraph>
