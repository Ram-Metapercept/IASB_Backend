It was based on the principle that a first&#x2011;time adopter should comply with the same standards as an entity that already applied IASs. However, the Board decided that it is more important to achieve comparability over time within a first&#x2011;time adopter&#x2019;s first IFRS financial statements and between different entities adopting IFRSs for the first time at a given date; achieving comparability between first&#x2011;time adopters and entities that already apply IFRSs is a secondary objective.</p></body></paragraph>
