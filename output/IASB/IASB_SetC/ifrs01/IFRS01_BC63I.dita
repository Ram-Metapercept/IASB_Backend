Consequently, those adjustments should be accounted for in accordance with <xref id="IFRS01_X1765" base="F16164176" href="IFRS01_11.dita#IFRS01_11">paragraph 11 of IFRS 1</xref>, and an entity should recognise those adjustments directly in retained earnings (or, if appropriate, in another category of equity) at the date of transition to IFRSs.</p></body></paragraph>
