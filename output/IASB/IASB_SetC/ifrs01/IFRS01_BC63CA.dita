Use of this exemption would require detailed calculations that would not be practicable for entities that used the method of accounting described in <xref base="F15825242" href="IFRS01_BC47A.dita#IFRS01_BC47A" id="IFRS01_X1748">paragraph BC47A</xref> under their previous GAAP. The Board noted that adjustments to liabilities as a result of initial adoption of IFRSs arise from events and transactions before the date of transition to IFRSs and are generally recognised in retained earnings. Therefore, the Board decided that, for entities that used the method of accounting described in paragraph BC47A, any adjustment for a difference between decommissioning, restoration and similar liabilities measured in accordance with <xref base="F15825243" href="../ias37/IAS37_TOC.dita#IAS37_TOC0001" id="IFRS01_X1749">IAS 37</xref> and the liability determined under the entity&#x2019;s previous GAAP should be accounted for in the same manner.</p></body></paragraph>
