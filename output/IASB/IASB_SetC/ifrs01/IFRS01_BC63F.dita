An entity would be unable to comply with IAS 29 if a reliable general price index is not available to all entities with that same functional currency, and exchangeability between the currency and a relatively stable foreign currency does not exist. However, once the functional currency changes to a non&#x2011;hyperinflationary currency, or the currency ceases to be severely hyperinflationary, an entity would be able to start applying IFRSs to subsequent transactions.</p></body></paragraph>
