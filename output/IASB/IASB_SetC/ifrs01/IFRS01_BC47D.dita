This is a consequence of having included these costs in the single carrying amount under the method of accounting described in <xref id="IFRS01_X1706" base="F15824983" href="IFRS01_BC47A.dita#IFRS01_BC47A">paragraph BC47A</xref>. To avoid the use of deemed costs resulting in an oil and gas asset being measured at more than its recoverable amount, the Board decided that oil and gas assets should be tested for impairment at the date of transition to IFRSs.</p></body></paragraph>
