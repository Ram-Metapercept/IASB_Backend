This is because it may raise further questions, such as whether the retrospective application would be permitted for all the loans for which the information needed was obtained at the time, even if there are other similar loans for which the fair value information was not obtained at that time; and whether the retrospective application should be restricted to all loans received after a certain date and for which all necessary information was obtained to enable retrospective application. The Board concluded that the exception proposed in paragraph B11 should be available on a loan-by-loan basis.</p></body></paragraph>
