Some requested an exemption from these criteria until the beginning of the latest period covered by the first IFRS financial statements (1 January 2005 for many entities). However, for the following reasons, the Board did not create an exemption in this area: </p><ol base="F7283758" id="IFRS01_L0158" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p base="F7283759" id="IFRS01_P2865">The Board&#x2019;s primary objective is comparability within a first&#x2011;time adopter&#x2019;s first IFRS financial statements and between different first&#x2011;time adopters switching to IFRSs at the same time (<xref base="F15825376" href="IFRS01_BC10.dita#IFRS01_BC10" id="IFRS01_X1803">paragraph BC10</xref>).</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p base="F7283761" id="IFRS01_P2866">The continuation of previous GAAP hedge accounting practices could permit the non&#x2011;recognition of derivatives or the recognition of deferred debits and credits that are not assets and liabilities.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p base="F7283763" id="IFRS01_P2867">The Board&#x2019;s benchmark for cost&#x2011;benefit assessments was an entity that has planned the transition to IFRSs and is able to collect the necessary information at, or very soon after, the date of transition to IFRSs (<xref base="F8124891" href="IFRS01_BC27.dita#IFRS01_BC27" id="IFRS01_X1804">paragraph BC27</xref>). Entities should not be &#x2018;rewarded&#x2019; by concessions if they failed to plan for transition, nor should that failure be allowed to undermine the integrity of their opening IFRS balance sheet. Entities switching to IFRSs in 2005 need to have their hedge accounting systems in place by the beginning of 2004. In the Board&#x2019;s view, that is a challenging but achievable timetable. Entities preparing to switch to IFRSs in 2004 should have been aware of the implications of IAS 39 already and the exposure draft of improvements to IAS 39, published in June 2002, proposed very few changes in this area, so delayed transition is not justified for these entities either.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
