Some respondents to ED 1 requested the Board to permit or require a first&#x2011;time adopter not to restate past derecognition transactions, on the following grounds: </p>       <ol base="F19756332" id="IFRS01_L0134" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>           <p base="F19756334" id="IFRS01_P2655">Restating past derecognition transactions would be costly, especially if restatement involves determining the fair value of retained servicing assets and liabilities and other components retained in a complex securitisation.
