In accordance with the IFRS, the subsidiary may measure its assets and liabilities at the carrying amounts that would be included in the parent&#x2019;s consolidated financial statements, based on the parent&#x2019;s date of transition to IFRSs, if no adjustments were made for consolidation procedures and for the effects of the business combination in which the parent acquired the subsidiary.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS01_FN0031" type="fn"/> Alternatively, it may elect to measure them at the carrying amounts required by the rest of the IFRS, based on the subsidiary&#x2019;s date of transition to IFRSs.
