Under the transitional provisions of SFAS 133 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities</ph></ph>, an entity need not account separately for some pre&#x2011;existing embedded derivatives. Nevertheless, the Board concluded that the failure to measure embedded derivatives at fair value would diminish the relevance and reliability of an entity&#x2019;s first IFRS financial statements. The Board also observed that <xref base="F19755422" href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001" id="IFRS01_X1786">IAS 39</xref> addresses an inability to measure an embedded derivative and the host contract separately. In such cases, IAS 39 requires an entity to measure the entire combined contract at fair value.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
