The Board expects that retrospective application will be appropriate in most cases, given its primary objective of comparability over time within a first&#x2011;time adopter&#x2019;s first IFRS financial statements. However, if the Board concludes in a particular case that prospective application by a first&#x2011;time adopter is justified, it will amend the IFRS on first&#x2011;time adoption of IFRSs. As a result, IFRS 1 will contain all material on first&#x2011;time adoption of IFRSs and other IFRSs will not refer to first&#x2011;time adopters (except, when needed, in the Basis for Conclusions and consequential amendments).</p></body></paragraph>
