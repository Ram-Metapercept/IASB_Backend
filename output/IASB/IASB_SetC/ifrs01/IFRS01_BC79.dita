However, the Board concluded that it would be reasonable (and consistent with IAS 39 paragraph 133<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS01_FN0039" type="fn"/>) to permit a first&#x2011;time adopter to designate an individual item as a hedged item within the net position, provided that it does so no later than the date of transition to IFRSs, to prevent selective designation. For similar reasons, the Board prohibited hedge accounting in the opening IFRS balance sheet for any hedging relationship of a type that does not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39 (see <xref href="IFRS01_B5.dita" id="IFRS01_X1801" scope="local">paragraph B5</xref> of the IFRS).</p></body></paragraph>
