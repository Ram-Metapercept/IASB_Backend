As a result, the entity&#x2019;s opening IFRS balance sheet would not have included that asset or liability if IFRSs permit or require a cost&#x2011;based measurement. Some respondents to ED 1 argued that this would be an unjustifiable departure from the principle that the opening IFRS balance sheet should include all assets and liabilities. The Board agreed with that conclusion. Therefore, <xref id="IFRS01_X1690" base="F15826141" href="IFRS01_C4.dita#IFRS01_C4">paragraph C4(f)</xref> of the IFRS requires that the acquirer should recognise those assets and liabilities and measure them on the basis that IFRSs would require in the separate balance sheet of the acquiree.</p></body></paragraph>
