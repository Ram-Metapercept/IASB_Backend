Obtaining the fair value information necessary to use the exemption in <xref id="IFRS01_X1711" base="F15825050" href="IFRS01_D5.dita#IFRS01_D5">paragraph D5</xref> may not be a practical alternative, given the lack of readily available fair value information for those assets.</p></body></paragraph>
