Determining the fair value of oil and gas assets is a complex process that begins with the difficult task of estimating the volume of reserves and resources. When the fair value amounts must be audited, determining significant inputs to the estimates generally requires the use of qualified external experts. For entities with many oil and gas assets, the use of this fair value as deemed cost alternative would not meet the Board&#x2019;s stated intention of avoiding excessive cost (see <xref id="IFRS01_X1703" base="F15824980" href="IFRS01_BC41.dita#IFRS01_BC41">paragraph BC41</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
