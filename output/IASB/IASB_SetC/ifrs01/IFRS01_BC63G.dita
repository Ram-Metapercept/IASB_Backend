The Board therefore decided to amend IFRS 1 to provide guidance on how an entity can present IFRS financial statements after its currency ceases to be severely hyperinflationary, by presenting an opening IFRS statement of financial position on or after the functional currency normalisation date.  The Board believed that allowing an entity to apply the exemption when presenting an opening IFRS statement of financial position after, and not just on, the functional currency normalisation date, would address practical concerns that may arise if the functional currency normalisation date and the entity&#x2019;s date of transition to IFRSs are different. The Board decided that this amendment would also be available to entities that were emerging from a period of severe hyperinflation but had not applied IFRSs in the past. </p></body></paragraph>
