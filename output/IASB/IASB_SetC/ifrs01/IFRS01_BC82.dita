Although this requirement could increase the risk of selective classification by first&#x2011;time adopters of the kind discussed in the previous paragraph, the Board noted that an entity could achieve a similar result by selective disposal of some assets before the date of transition to IFRSs. Therefore, the Board concluded that it should treat first&#x2011;time adopters in the same way as entities that already apply IFRSs by requiring retrospective application.</p></body></paragraph>
