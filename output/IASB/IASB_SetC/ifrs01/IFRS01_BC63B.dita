For example, for equity&#x2011;settled share&#x2011;based payment arrangements, IFRS 2 requires an entity to apply IFRS 2 to shares, share options or other equity instruments that were granted after 7 November 2002 and had not vested at the effective date of IFRS 2. IFRS 2 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005. There are also transitional arrangements for liabilities arising from cash&#x2011;settled share&#x2011;based payment transactions, and for modifications of the terms or conditions of a grant of equity instruments to which IFRS 2 has not been applied, if the modification occurs after the effective date of IFRS 2. The Board decided that, in general, first&#x2011;time adopters should be treated in the same way as entities that already apply IFRSs. For example, a first&#x2011;time adopter should not be required to apply IFRS 2 to equity instruments that were granted on or before 7 November 2002. Similarly, a first&#x2011;time adopter should not be required to apply IFRS 2 to equity instruments that were granted after 7 November 2002 if those equity instruments vested before 1 January 2005. In addition, the Board decided that a first&#x2011;time adopter should not be required to apply IFRS 2 to equity instruments that were granted after 7 November 2002 if those equity instruments vested before the date of transition to IFRSs. Similarly, the Board decided that a first&#x2011;time adopter should not be required to apply IFRS 2 to liabilities arising from cash&#x2011;settled share&#x2011;based payment transactions if those liabilities were settled before the date of transition to IFRSs.</p></body></paragraph>
