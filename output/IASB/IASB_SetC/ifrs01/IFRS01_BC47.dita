It may not always be clear whether a previous revaluation was intended as a measure of fair value or differs materially from fair value. The flexibility in this area permits a cost&#x2011;effective solution for the unique problem of transition to IFRSs. It allows a first&#x2011;time adopter to establish a deemed cost using a measurement that is already available and is a reasonable starting point for a cost&#x2011;based measurement.</p></body></paragraph>
