Respondents to the exposure draft published in October 2007 supported the restructuring. The revised structure of the IFRS issued in November 2008 is easier for the reader to understand and is better designed to accommodate future changes. The focus of the restructuring was to move to appendices all specific exemptions and exceptions from the requirements of IFRSs. Exemptions are categorised into business combinations, exemptions and short&#x2011;term exemptions. Exemptions are applicable to all first&#x2011;time adopters regardless of their date of transition to IFRSs. Short&#x2011;term exemptions are those exemptions applicable to users for a short time. Once those exemptions have become out of date, they will be deleted.</p></body></paragraph>
