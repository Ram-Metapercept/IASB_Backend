The Board decided to place some limits on this election and noted that information is more likely to be available for more recent business combinations. Therefore, if a first&#x2011;time adopter restates any business combination, the IFRS requires it to restate all later business combinations (<xref id="IFRS01_X1689" base="F8124354" href="IFRS01_C1.dita#IFRS01_C1">paragraph C1</xref> of the IFRS).</p></body></paragraph>
