For example, a law or a regulator requires an entity to present the first comparative financial statements in accordance with both IFRSs and previous GAAP and the second comparative in accordance with previous GAAP only. The presentation of this information is an exception from the requirement in paragraph 38C of IAS 1 (to allow an entity to present comparative information in addition to the minimum comparative information required by IFRSs).</p></body></paragraph>
