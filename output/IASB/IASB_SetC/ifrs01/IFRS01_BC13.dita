However, in the Board&#x2019;s view, it is up to the parties to an agreement to determine whether to insulate the agreement from the effects of a future IFRS and, if not, how they might renegotiate it so that it reflects changes in the underlying financial condition rather than changes in reporting (<xref base="F15824425" href="../preface/PREFACETOIFRS.dita" scope="local" id="IFRS01_X1618">paragraph 21<ph><xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS01_FN0014" type="fn"/></ph> of the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Preface to International Financial Reporting Standards</ph></ph></xref>).</p>       </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>         <p base="F7283315" id="IFRS01_P2614">to give a first&#x2011;time adopter the same accounting options as an entity that already applies IFRSs. However, permitting prospective application by a first&#x2011;time adopter would conflict with the Board&#x2019;s primary objective of comparability within an entity&#x2019;s first IFRS financial statements (<xref base="F15824426" href="IFRS01_BC10.dita#IFRS01_BC10" id="IFRS01_X1619">paragraph BC10</xref>). Therefore, the Board did not adopt a general policy of giving first&#x2011;time adopters the same accounting options of prospective application that existing IFRSs give to entities that already apply IFRSs. <xref base="F15824427" keyref="IFRS01_gBC20-BC23_V1" id="IFRS01_X1620">Paragraphs BC20&#x2013;BC23</xref> discuss one specific case, namely derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities.</p>       </li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value>         <p base="F7283318" id="IFRS01_P2615">to avoid difficult distinctions between changes in estimates and changes in the basis for making estimates. However, a first&#x2011;time adopter need not make this distinction in preparing its opening IFRS balance sheet, so the IFRS does not include exemptions on these grounds. If an entity becomes aware of errors made under previous GAAP, the IFRS requires it to disclose the correction of the errors (<xref base="F15824428" href="IFRS01_26.dita#IFRS01_26" id="IFRS01_X1621">paragraph 26</xref> of the IFRS).</p>       </li></ol></body></paragraph>
