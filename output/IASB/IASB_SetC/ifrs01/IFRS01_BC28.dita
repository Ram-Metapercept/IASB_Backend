However, some respondents disagreed with this all&#x2011;or&#x2011;nothing approach for the following reasons: </p><ol id="IFRS01_L0138" base="F7283419" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS01_P2679" base="F7283420">Many of the exemptions are not interdependent, so there is no conceptual reason to condition use of one exemption on use of other exemptions.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS01_P2680" base="F7283422">Although it is necessary to permit some exemptions on pragmatic grounds, entities should be encouraged to use as few exemptions as possible.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS01_P2681" base="F7283424">Some of the exemptions proposed in ED 1 were implicit options because they relied on the entity&#x2019;s own judgement of undue cost or effort and some others were explicit options. Only a few exemptions were really mandatory.</p></li><li><li_value>(d)</li_value> <p id="IFRS01_P2682" base="F7283426">Unlike the other exceptions to retrospective application, the requirement to apply hedge accounting prospectively was not intended as a pragmatic concession on cost&#x2011;benefit grounds. Retrospective application in an area that relies on designation by management would not be acceptable, even if an entity applied all other aspects of IFRSs retrospectively.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
