The Board noted that the general requirement in IFRS 1 for first-time adopters to apply IFRSs retrospectively at the date of transition to IFRSs could require some entities to measure such government loans at fair value at a date before the date of transition to IFRSs. This may lead to an entity applying hindsight if it must derive a fair value that needs significant unobservable inputs. Accordingly, the Board decided to add an exception to the retrospective application of IFRSs to require that first-time adopters shall apply the requirements of IAS 20 prospectively to government loans existing at the date of transition to IFRSs, unless the necessary information was obtained at the time of initially accounting for that loan. As a result of not applying IAS 20 and <xref base="F43925878" href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_TOC.dita#IFRS09_TOC0001/IFRS09_TOC0001_V1" id="IFRS01_X1806">IFRS 9</xref> retrospectively to government loans at the date of transition, the corresponding benefit of the government loan at a below-market rate of interest is not recognised as a government grant.</p></body></paragraph>
