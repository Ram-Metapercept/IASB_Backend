In recognition of comments on the exposure draft, the Board revised paragraph B10 to specify that an entity applies IAS 32 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Financial Instruments: Presentation</ph></ph> to classify the government loans as a financial liability or an equity instrument, and to limit the scope of the exemption to matters of recognition and measurement. This will give first-time adopters the same relief as existing preparers and will mean that if a first-time adopter had classified government loans in equity under its previous GAAP, it will reclassify those loans as liabilities, if those loans meet the definition of a financial liability in IAS 32. The Board also clarified that an entity should use its previous GAAP carrying amount of such loans at the date of transition to IFRSs as the carrying amount in the opening IFRS statement of financial position. <xref base="F43925879" href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_TOC.dita#IFRS09_TOC0001/IFRS09_TOC0001_V1" id="IFRS01_X1808">IFRS 9</xref> should be applied to such loans subsequently.</p></body></paragraph>
