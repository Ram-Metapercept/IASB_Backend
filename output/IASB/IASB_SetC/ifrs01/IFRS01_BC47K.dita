An entity&#x2019;s use of this exemption results in a new cost basis for the item and previous GAAP depreciation methods and capitalisation policies are not relevant. Thus, if an entity uses this exemption for items of property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, it does not also apply the exemption for borrowing costs provided in <xref id="IFRS01_X1715" base="F15825053" href="IFRS01_gD23-D23.dita#IFRS01_gD23-D23">paragraph D23</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
