For example, in some jurisdictions, entities accounted for some previous acquisitions that were share&#x2011;for&#x2011;share exchanges using so&#x2011;called &#x2018;merger relief&#x2019; or &#x2018;group reconstruction relief&#x2019;. In this situation, the carrying amount of the investment in the parent&#x2019;s separate financial statements was based on the nominal value of the shares given rather than the value of the purchase consideration. This might make it difficult or impossible to measure the fair value of the shares given.</p></body></paragraph>
