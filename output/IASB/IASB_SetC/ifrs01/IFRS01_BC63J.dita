The Board noted that preparation of information in accordance with IFRSs for periods before the functional currency normalisation date may not be possible; hence the exemption refers to a date of transition on or after the functional currency normalisation date. This may lead to a comparative period of less than 12 months. The Board identified that entities should consider whether disclosure of non&#x2011;IFRS comparative information and historical summaries, in accordance with <xref id="IFRS01_X1767" base="F16164178" href="IFRS01_g22-22.dita#IFRS01_g22-22">paragraph 22 of IFRS 1</xref>, would provide useful information to users of financial statements. The Board also noted that an entity should clearly explain the transition to IFRSs in accordance with <xref id="IFRS01_X1768" base="F16164179" href="IFRS01_23.dita#IFRS01_23">paragraphs 23&#x2013;28</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
