Moreover, the development of some assets currently in use may have been completed many years ago. The costs of gathering the information required to capitalise borrowing costs retrospectively may therefore be significant. In addition, the nature of each development generally varies and therefore retrospective application might not provide useful trend information to users of financial statements. The Board concluded that the costs of applying the amendments retrospectively might exceed the potential benefits of doing so. Consequently, an entity applies the amendments only to borrowing costs incurred on or after the date it first applies the amendments.</p></body></paragraph>
