Messrs Cope, Danjou and Garnett support the convergence work programme, but only if it results in higher quality standards and improved financial reporting. They are of the opinion that IAS 23 and SFAS 34 are both in need of significant improvement and should not have been addressed as part of short&#x2011;term convergence.</p></body></paragraph>
