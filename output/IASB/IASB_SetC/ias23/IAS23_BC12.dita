The Board disagrees with those respondents. Acquisition costs as defined in the context of a business combination are different from borrowing costs incurred in constructing or producing a qualifying asset. Borrowing costs are part of the cost necessarily incurred to get the asset ready for its intended use or sale. Acquisition costs relating to a business combination are costs incurred for services performed to help with the acquisition, such as due diligence and professional fees. They are not costs of assets acquired in a business combination.</p></body></paragraph>
