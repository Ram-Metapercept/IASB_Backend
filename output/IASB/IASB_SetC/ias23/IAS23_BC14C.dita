In other words, an entity could have repaid that borrowing if the expenditure on the qualifying asset had not been made. Accordingly, <xref id="IAS23_X0117" base="F74058561" href="IAS23_14.dita#IAS23_14/IAS23_14_V2">paragraph 14</xref> requires an entity to use all outstanding borrowings in determining the capitalisation rate, except those made specifically to obtain a qualifying asset not yet ready for its intended use or sale.</p></body></paragraph>
