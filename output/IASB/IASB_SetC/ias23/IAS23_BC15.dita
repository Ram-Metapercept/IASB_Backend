Additionally, some assets currently in use may have undergone and completed their production or construction process many years ago. If the entity has been following the accounting policy of immediately recognising borrowing costs as an expense, the costs of gathering the information required to capitalise them retrospectively and to adjust the carrying amount of the asset may exceed the potential benefits. Hence, the Board decided to require prospective application, which was supported by respondents to the exposure draft.</p></body></paragraph>
