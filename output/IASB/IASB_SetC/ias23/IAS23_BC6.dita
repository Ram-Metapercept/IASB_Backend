The Board acknowledges the difficulty in both allocating borrowing costs to inventories that are manufactured in large quantities on a repetitive basis and monitoring those borrowing costs until the inventory is sold. It concluded that it should not require an entity to capitalise borrowing costs on such inventories because the costs of capitalisation are likely to exceed the potential benefits.</p></body></paragraph>
