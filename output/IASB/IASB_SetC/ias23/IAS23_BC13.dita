Achieving convergence in principle with US GAAP on this topic is a milestone in the Memorandum of Understanding published by the FASB and IASB in February 2006, which is a step towards removal of the requirement imposed on foreign registrants with the SEC to reconcile their financial statements to US GAAP.</p></body></paragraph>
