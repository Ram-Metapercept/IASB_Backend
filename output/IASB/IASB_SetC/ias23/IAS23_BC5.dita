The exposure draft did not make an exception for borrowing costs relating to such inventories. The exposure draft, therefore, proposed to require an entity to capitalise borrowing costs relating to inventories that are manufactured in large quantities on a repetitive basis and take a substantial period of time to get ready for sale. Respondents argued that capitalising those borrowing costs would create a significant administrative burden, would not be informative to users and would create a reconciling item between IFRSs and US GAAP.</p></body></paragraph>
