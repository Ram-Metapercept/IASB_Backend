During the period when an asset is under development, the expenditures for the resources used must be financed. Financing has a cost. The cost of the asset should include all costs necessarily incurred to get the asset ready for its intended use or sale, including the cost incurred in financing the expenditures as a part of the asset&#x2019;s acquisition cost. The Board reasoned that recognising immediately as an expense borrowing costs relating to qualifying assets does not give a faithful representation of the cost of the asset.</p></body></paragraph>
