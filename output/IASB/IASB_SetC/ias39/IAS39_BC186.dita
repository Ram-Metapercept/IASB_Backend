In particular, it interrelates with the requirement in IAS 39 that the fair value of a liability with a demand feature is not less than the amount payable on demand, discounted from the first date that the amount could be required to be paid.<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS39_FN0126" type="fn"/> This requirement applies to all liabilities with a demand feature, not only to those included in a portfolio hedge.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
