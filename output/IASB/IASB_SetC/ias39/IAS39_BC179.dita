Instead they incorporate the effect of prepayments by grouping the hedged portfolio into repricing time periods based on <i>expected</i> repayment dates (rather than contractual repayment dates). For example, an entity with a portfolio of 25&#x2011;year mortgages of CU100 may expect 5 per cent of that portfolio to repay in one year&#x2019;s time, in which case it schedules an amount of CU5 into a 12&#x2011;month time period. The entity schedules all other items contained in its portfolio in a similar way (ie on the basis of expected repayment dates) and hedges all or part of the resulting overall net position in each repricing time period.</p></body></paragraph>
