The Board observed that although a hedging relationship may have been discontinued, the amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve arising from that hedging relationship remains in the reserve if the hedged future cash flows are still expected to occur. The Board noted that if the hedged future cash flows are still expected to occur, the previously designated hedged item will be subject to a change required by the reform, even if the hedging relationship has been discontinued.</p></body></paragraph>
