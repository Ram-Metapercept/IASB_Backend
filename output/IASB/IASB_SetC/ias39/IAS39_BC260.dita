In the Board&#x2019;s view, allowing hedge accounting for designated portions that are       not separately identifiable at the inception would be inconsistent with the objective of the       exception. The Board noted that such circumstances are different from allowing continued       designation as the hedged item for designated portions that had met the requirement at the       inception of the hedging relationship.</p></body></paragraph>
