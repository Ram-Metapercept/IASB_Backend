This is because an entity&#x2019;s ability to conclude that the alternative benchmark rate meets the requirements in <xref href="IAS39_81.dita" scope="local">paragraphs 81</xref> and <xref href="IAS39_AG99F.dita" scope="local">AG99F of IAS 39</xref> that a risk portion must be separately identifiable and reliably measurable could be affected in the early stages of the reform.</p></body></paragraph>
