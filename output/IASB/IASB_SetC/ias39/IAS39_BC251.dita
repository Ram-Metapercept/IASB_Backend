However, the Board noted that its approach still maintains a level of discipline around the application of the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 39</ph></ph> hedge accounting model through the prospective assessment and neither imposes additional costs or burden for preparers nor introduces new requirements in <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 39</ph></ph>.</p></body></paragraph>
