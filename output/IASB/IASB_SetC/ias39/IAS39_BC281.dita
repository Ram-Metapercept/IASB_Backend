The Board considered whether it should extend the relief provided such that the exceptions would apply at the hedging relationship level for as long as any element of that hedging relationship was affected by the uncertainties arising from the reform. The Board agreed that doing so would be beyond the objective of addressing only those issues directly affected by the uncertainty arising from the reform. This is also because the exceptions in <xref href="IAS39_g102D-102D.dita">paragraphs 102D&#x2013;102N of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 39</ph></ph></xref> and the respective requirements in <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 39</ph></ph> apply to the same elements of the hedging relationship. Therefore, applying each exception at the hedging relationship level would be inconsistent with how the underlying requirements are applied.</p></body></paragraph>
