As described in the 2019 Exposure Draft, that assessment is based on the actual results of the hedging relationship based on the extent to which hedging gains or losses on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk offset changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument. The Board noted that existing IFRS Standards already provide an adequate basis for measuring ineffectiveness.</p></body></paragraph>
