Therefore, the       Board decided to publish in May 2019 the Exposure Draft <i>Interest Rate Benchmark Reform</i> (2019       Exposure Draft), which proposed exceptions to <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 9</ph></ph> and <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 39</ph></ph> to provide relief during this       period of uncertainty.</p></body></paragraph>
