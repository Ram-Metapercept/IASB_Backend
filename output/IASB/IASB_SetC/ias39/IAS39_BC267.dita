In the Board&#x2019;s view, voluntary application of these       exceptions could give rise to selective discontinuation of hedge accounting and selective       reclassification of the amounts recorded in other comprehensive income related to previously       discontinued hedging relationships. The Board does not expect that requiring entities to apply       the exceptions would entail significant cost for preparers and other affected parties because       the exceptions require entities to assume that the interest rate benchmark, on which the hedged       risk and the hedged cash flows and cash flows of the hedging instrument are based, is not       altered as a result of the reform.</p></body></paragraph>
