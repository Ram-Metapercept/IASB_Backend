Consequently, the Board amended the transition paragraph to specify that retrospective       application applies only to those hedging relationships that existed at the beginning of the       reporting period in which an entity first applies these amendments or were designated       thereafter, and to the gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income that existed at       the beginning of the reporting period in which an entity first applies these amendments. The       Board used this wording to permit an entity to apply the amendments from the beginning of the       reporting period in which an entity first applies these amendments even if the reporting       period is not an annual period.</p></body></paragraph>
