It noted that in many cases, changes in the cash flows or fair value of a portion of a non&#x2011;financial hedged item are difficult to isolate and measure. Moreover, the Board noted that permitting portions of non&#x2011;financial assets and non&#x2011;financial liabilities to be designated as the hedged item for risk other than foreign currency risk would compromise the principles of identification of the hedged item and effectiveness testing that the Board has confirmed because the portion could be designated so that no ineffectiveness would ever arise.</p></body></paragraph>
