The IASB decided that in these circumstances the novation had occurred in order to effect clearing through a CCP, albeit indirectly. The IASB thus decided also to include such novations in the scope of the amendments because they are consistent with the objective of the proposed amendments&#x2014;they enable hedge accounting to continue when novations occur as a consequence of laws or regulations or the introduction of laws or regulations that increase the use of CCPs. However, the IASB noted that when parties to a hedging instrument enter into novations with different counterparties (for example, with different clearing members), these amendments only apply if each of those parties ultimately effects clearing with the same central counterparty.</p></body></paragraph>
