Therefore, if the risk portion is not reliably measurable, either when it is designated or thereafter, the alternative benchmark rate would not meet the qualifying criteria to be designated as a risk portion in a hedging relationship. Similarly, if the hedging relationship fails to meet any other qualifying criteria set out in IAS 39 to apply hedge accounting, either at the date the alternative benchmark rate is designated or during the 24-month period, the entity is required to discontinue hedge accounting prospectively from that date. The Board decided that providing relief only for the separately identifiable requirement would achieve the objective described in <xref href="IAS39_BC292.dita" scope="local">paragraph BC292</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
