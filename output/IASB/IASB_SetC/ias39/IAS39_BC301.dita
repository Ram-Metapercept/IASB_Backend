For these reasons, in the 2020 Exposure Draft, the Board proposed that an entity would be required to amend the formal designation of the hedging relationship as previously documented to make one or more of these changes:</p><ol type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>         <p>designating the alternative benchmark rate (contractually or non-contractually specified) as a hedged risk;</p>       </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>         <p>amending the description of the hedged item so it refers to the alternative benchmark rate;</p>       </li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value>         <p>amending the description of the hedging instrument so it refers to the alternative benchmark rate; or</p>       </li><li><li_value>(d)</li_value>         <p>amending the description of how the entity will assess hedge effectiveness.</p>       </li></ol></body></paragraph>
