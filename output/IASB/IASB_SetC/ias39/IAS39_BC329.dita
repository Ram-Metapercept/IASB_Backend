Therefore, if an entity uses a hypothetical derivative&#x2014;that is, a derivative that would have terms matching the critical terms of the designated cash flows and the hedged risk, commonly used in cash flow hedges to represent the forecast transaction&#x2014;the entity may need to change the hypothetical derivative to calculate the change in the value of the hedged item to measure hedge ineffectiveness.</p></body></paragraph>
