The Board considered that the actual results of the hedging relationships would provide useful information to users of financial statements during the period of uncertainty arising from the reform. Therefore, the Board decided that entities should continue to measure and recognise hedge ineffectiveness as required by IFRS Standards.</p></body></paragraph>
