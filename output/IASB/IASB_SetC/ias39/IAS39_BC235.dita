<paragraph id="IAS39_BC235"><paranum>BC235</paranum><prolog><data name="standard_number" value="IAS 39"/><data name="paranum" value="BC235"/></prolog><body><p>The Board noted that if an entity designates a forecast transaction as the hedged item in a cash flow hedge, applying <xref href="IAS39_88.dita#IAS39_88">paragraph 88(c) of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 39</ph></ph></xref>, that transaction must be highly probable (highly probable requirement). This requirement is intended to ensure that changes in the fair value of designated hedging instruments are recognised in other comprehensive income only for those hedged forecast transactions that are highly probable to occur. This requirement is an important discipline in applying hedge accounting to forecast transactions. The Board noted that the requirements in <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 39</ph></ph> provide a clear basis to account for the effects of the reform&#x2014;that is, if the effects of the reform are such that the hedged cash flows are no longer highly probable, hedge accounting should be discontinued. As set out in <xref href="IAS39_BC227.dita">paragraph BC227</xref>, in the Board&#x2019;s view, discontinuing all affected hedging relationships solely due to such uncertainty would not provide useful information to users of financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
