In finalising the Exposure Draft <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Fair Value Hedge Accounting for a Portfolio Hedge of Interest Rate Risk</ph></ph>, the Board received comments that demonstrated that the meaning of a &#x2018;portion&#x2019; was unclear in this context. Accordingly, the Board decided to amend IAS 39 to provide further guidance on what may be designated as a hedged portion, including confirmation that it is not possible to designate a portion that is greater than the total cash flows of the asset or liability.</p></body></paragraph>
