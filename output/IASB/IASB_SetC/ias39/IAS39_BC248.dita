Applying this approach would require entities to separate the assessment of retrospective effectiveness from the measurement of hedge ineffectiveness. More specifically, the Board considered that the objective of this approach would be to exclude the uncertainty arising from the reform from the assessment of whether a hedge is considered to be highly effective and that hedge accounting is continued when the results of this assessment are within the range of 80&#x2013;125 per cent as required in <xref href="IAS39_AG105.dita">paragraph AG105(b) of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 39</ph></ph></xref>, even if the measurement of actual ineffectiveness is outside that range. The Board was of the view that even though this approach is consistent with the other exceptions provided in the amendments to IAS 39, the requirement to perform two effectiveness calculations based on different assumptions could be burdensome on preparers. The Board therefore rejected this approach.</p></body></paragraph>
