Some argued that the hedge accounting provisions should be simplified by having only one type of hedge accounting. Some also raised concern about an entity&#x2019;s ability, in some cases, to choose between two hedge accounting methods for the same hedging strategy (ie the choice between designating a forward contract to sell an existing asset as a fair value hedge of the asset or a cash flow hedge of a forecast sale of the asset).</p></body></paragraph>
