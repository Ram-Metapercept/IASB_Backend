Respondents noted that due to the inherent interaction between the       assessment of the forward-looking cash flows of the hedged item and its effect on both       prospective and retrospective assessments, the proposed amendments would not achieve their       intended effect unless an exception is also provided for the retrospective assessment.</p></body></paragraph>
