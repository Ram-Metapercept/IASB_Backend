In the absence of such scheduling and tracking, some assumptions would need to be made about these matters and, hence, about how much should be removed from the separate balance sheet line items when an asset (or liability) in the hedged portfolio is derecognised. In addition, some safeguards would be needed to ensure that amounts included in the separate balance sheet line items are removed from the balance sheet over a reasonable period and do not remain in the balance sheet indefinitely. With these points in mind, the Board decided to require that: </p><ol id="IAS39_L0189" base="SL135770" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IAS39_P5625" base="SL135772">whenever an asset (or liability) in the hedged portfolio is derecognised&#x2014;whether through earlier than expected prepayment, sale or write&#x2011;off from impairment&#x2014;any amount included in the separate balance sheet line item relating to that derecognised asset (or liability) should be removed from the balance sheet and included in the gain or loss on derecognition.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IAS39_P5626" base="SL135774">if an entity cannot determine into which time period(s) a derecognised asset (or liability) was scheduled:</p> <ol id="IAS39_L0190" base="SL135775" type="lower-roman"><li><li_value>(i)</li_value> <p id="IAS39_P5627" base="SL135777">it should assume that higher than expected prepayments occur on assets scheduled into the first available time period; and</p></li><li><li_value>(ii)</li_value> <p id="IAS39_P5628" base="SL135779">it should allocate sales and impairments to assets scheduled into all time periods containing the derecognised item on a systematic and rational basis.</p></li></ol></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IAS39_P5629" base="SL135781">the entity should track how much of the total amount included in the separate line items relates to each repricing time period, and should remove the amount that relates to a particular time period from the balance sheet no later than when that time period expires.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
