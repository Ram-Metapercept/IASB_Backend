Respondents also said that changes to the hedge designation necessary to reflect changes required by the reform are not expected to represent a change in an entity&#x2019;s risk management strategy or risk management objective for hedging their exposure to interest rate risk. Therefore, the Board concluded that continuing to apply hedge accounting to the affected hedging relationships when making changes required by the reform would correspond with the Board&#x2019;s objective for issuing the Phase 1 amendments in September 2019.</p></body></paragraph>
