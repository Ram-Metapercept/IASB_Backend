The financial instrument that was recognised is a five&#x2011;year instrument that will affect profit or loss for five years. The wording in <xref href="IAS39_97.dita" scope="local" id="IAS39_X1802">paragraph 97</xref> suggested that the gains or losses should be reclassified over five years, even though the cash flows designated as the hedged item were hedged for the effects of interest rate changes over only a three&#x2011;month period.</p></body></paragraph>
