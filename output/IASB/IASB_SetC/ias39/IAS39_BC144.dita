The original IAS 39 precluded such designation because of the different bases for measuring derivatives and cash instruments. The Exposure Draft did not propose a change to this limitation. However, some commentators suggested a change, noting that entities do not distinguish between derivative and non&#x2011;derivative financial instruments in their hedging and other risk management activities and that entities may have to use a non&#x2011;derivative financial instrument to hedge risk if no suitable derivative financial instrument exists.</p></body></paragraph>
