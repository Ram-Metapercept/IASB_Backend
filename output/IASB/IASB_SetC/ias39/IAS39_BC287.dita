The Board highlighted that       retrospective application of the amendments would not allow reinstating hedge accounting that       has already been discontinued. Nor would it allow designation in hindsight. If an entity had       not designated a hedging relationship, the exceptions, even though applied retrospectively,       would not allow the entity to apply hedge accounting in prior periods to items that were not       designated for hedge accounting. Doing so would be inconsistent with the requirement that       hedge accounting applies prospectively. Retrospective application of the exceptions would       enable entities to continue hedge accounting for a hedging relationship that the entity had       previously designated and that qualifies for hedge accounting applying <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 39</ph></ph>.</p></body></paragraph>
