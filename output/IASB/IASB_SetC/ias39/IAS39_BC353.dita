In other words, an entity is required to assess, for each hedge designation, whether the qualifying criteria to apply hedge accounting, including the separately identifiable requirement, are met for the remainder of the 24-month period (ie until 31 March 20X3 following from the example in <xref href="IAS39_BC351.dita" scope="local">paragraph BC351</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
