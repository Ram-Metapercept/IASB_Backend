The Board considered that if an entity concludes for one hedging relationship that it no longer has a reasonable expectation that the alternative benchmark rate would meet the requirements within the 24-month period, it is likely that the entity would reach the same conclusion for all other hedging relationships in which that particular alternative benchmark rate has been designated. Applying this requirement to the example in <xref href="IAS39_BC351.dita" scope="local">paragraph BC351</xref>, the 24-month period will begin on 31 March 20X1 for that alternative benchmark rate.</p></body></paragraph>
