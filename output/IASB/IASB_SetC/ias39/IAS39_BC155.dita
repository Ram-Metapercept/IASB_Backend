One example is that of a US entity that expects to make a future purchase of a German machine that it will pay for in euro. The entity enters into a derivative to hedge against possible future changes in the US dollar/euro exchange rate. Such a hedge is classified as a cash flow hedge under IAS 39, with the effect that gains and losses on the hedging instrument (to the extent that the hedge is effective) are initially recognised in equity.<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS39_FN0111" type="fn"/> The question the Board considered is what the accounting should be once the future transaction takes place. In its deliberations on this issue, the Board discussed the following approaches: </p><ol id="IAS39_L0165" base="SL135614" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IAS39_P5438" base="SL135616">to remove the hedging gain or loss from equity and recognise it as part of the initial carrying amount of the asset or liability (in the example above, the machine). In future periods, the hedging gain or loss is automatically recognised in profit or loss by being included in amounts such as depreciation expense (for a fixed asset), interest income or expense (for a financial asset or financial liability), or cost of sales (for inventories). This treatment is commonly referred to as &#x2018;basis adjustment&#x2019;.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IAS39_P5439" base="SL135618">to leave the hedging gain or loss in equity. In future periods, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is &#x2018;recycled&#x2019; to profit or loss in the same period(s) as the acquired asset or liability affects profit or loss. This recycling requires a separate adjustment and is not automatic.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
