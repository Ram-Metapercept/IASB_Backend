In this approach, in the portfolio in the above example, 20 per cent of the assets of CU100 in this repricing time period is designated as the hedged item (figure 4(a)). As a result, if some assets prepay <i>earlier</i> than expected so that the entity revises <i>downwards</i> its estimate of the amount of assets in this repricing time period (eg from CU100 to CU90, figure 4(b)), ineffectiveness arises on 20 per cent of the decrease (in this case ineffectiveness arises on CU2). Similarly, if some assets prepay <i>later</i> than expected so that the entity revises <i>upwards</i> its estimate of the amount of assets in this repricing time period (eg from CU100 to CU110, figure 4(c)), ineffectiveness arises on 20 per cent of the increase (in this case ineffectiveness arises on CU2).</p><fig id="IAS39_BC199-figure4"><title id="IAS39_BC199-figure4_TI" indented="yes">Figure 4: Illustrating the designation of an amount of assets as a percentage</title><image href="graphics/IAS39_BC199-figure4.pdf" id="IAS39_BC199-figure4-pdf" otherprops="print" placement="inline"/></fig></body></paragraph>
