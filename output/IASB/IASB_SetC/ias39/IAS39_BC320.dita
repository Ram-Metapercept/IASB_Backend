Therefore, an entity would apply the requirements in <xref href="IAS39_89.dita" scope="local">paragraphs 89</xref> (for a fair value hedge) and <xref href="IAS39_96.dita" scope="local">96</xref> (for a cash flow hedge) of IAS 39 for the measurement and recognition of hedge ineffectiveness. The Board considered that accounting for such fair value changes in any other way would be inconsistent with the decision to continue applying hedge accounting for such amended hedging relationships (see <xref href="IAS39_102P.dita" scope="local">paragraph 102P of IAS 39</xref>). In the Board&#x2019;s view, applying the requirements in IAS 39 for the recognition and measurement of ineffectiveness reflects the economic effects of the amendments to the formal designation of a hedging relationship and therefore, provides useful information to users of financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
