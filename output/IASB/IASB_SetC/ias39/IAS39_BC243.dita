<paragraph id="IAS39_BC243"><paranum>BC243</paranum><prolog><data name="standard_number" value="IAS 39"/><data name="paranum" value="BC243"/></prolog><body><p>The Board noted that an offset between the hedged item and the hedging instrument is a fundamental principle of the hedge accounting model in <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 39</ph></ph> and, therefore, the Board considered it critical to maintain this principle. The exception addresses only the uncertainties arising from the reform. Therefore, if an entity is unable to demonstrate that a hedging relationship is expected to be highly effective for other reasons, the entity shall discontinue hedge accounting as required by <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 39</ph></ph>. </p></body></paragraph>
