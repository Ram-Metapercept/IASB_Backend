This is because hedge accounting is applied prospectively and applying it retrospectively to discontinued hedging relationships usually requires the use of hindsight. However, the Board considered that in the specific circumstances of the reform, an entity would typically be able to reinstate a discontinued hedging relationship without the use of hindsight. The Board noted that this reinstatement of discontinued hedging relationships would apply to a very targeted population for a short period&#x2014;that is, for hedging relationships which would not have been discontinued if the Phase 2 amendments relating to hedge accounting had been applied at the point of discontinuation. The Board therefore proposed in the 2020 Exposure Draft that an entity would be required to reinstate hedging relationships that were discontinued solely due to changes required by the reform before an entity first applies the proposed amendments.</p></body></paragraph>
