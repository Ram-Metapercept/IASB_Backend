As noted in <xref href="IAS39_102L.dita" scope="local">paragraph 102L of IAS 39</xref>, this exception ceases to apply to the hedged item and the hedging instrument, respectively, at the earlier of, when there is no longer uncertainty about the hedged risk or the timing and the amount of the interest rate benchmark-based cash flows; and when the hedging relationship that the hedged item and the hedging instrument are a part of is discontinued.</p></body></paragraph>
