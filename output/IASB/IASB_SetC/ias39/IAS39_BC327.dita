An entity is required to cease applying this exception at the earlier of the date the uncertainty arising from the reform is no longer present with respect to the timing and the amount of the interest rate benchmark-based cash flows of the hedged item; and the date the hedging relationship of which the hedged item is a part of is discontinued.</p></body></paragraph>
