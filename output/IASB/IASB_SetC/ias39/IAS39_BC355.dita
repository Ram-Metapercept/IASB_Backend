However, in the Board&#x2019;s view, a clearly defined end point is necessary because of the temporary nature of the amendment. The exception described in <xref href="IAS39_g102Z1-102Z3.dita" scope="local">paragraphs 102Z1&#x2013;102Z3 of IAS 39</xref> is a significant relief from one of the requirements that is a basis for the robustness of the hedge accounting requirements, therefore the relief is intentionally short-lived. The Board considered that a period of 24 months will assist entities in applying the hedge accounting requirements in IAS 39 particularly during the early stages of the transition to alternative benchmark rates. Therefore, the Board decided that a period of 24 months from the date an entity first designates an alternative benchmark rate as a non-contractually specified risk portion, is a reasonable period and would enable entities to implement the reform and comply with any regulatory requirements, while avoiding potential short-term disruption as the market for an alternative benchmark rate develops.</p></body></paragraph>
