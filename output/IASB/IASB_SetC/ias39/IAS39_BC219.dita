The Board noted that such entities could apply <xref base="F16154563" href="IAS39_101.dita#IAS39_101" id="IAS39_X1880">paragraph 101(d)</xref> to revoke the designation of a cash flow hedge and re&#x2011;designate a new fair value hedge using the same hedged item and hedging instrument, and decided to clarify this in the Application Guidance. Additionally, the Board concluded that clarification was not required for first&#x2011;time adopters because <xref base="F16154564" href="../ifrs01/IFRS01_TOC.dita#IFRS01_TOC0001" id="IAS39_X1881">IFRS 1</xref> already contained sufficient guidance.</p></body></paragraph>
