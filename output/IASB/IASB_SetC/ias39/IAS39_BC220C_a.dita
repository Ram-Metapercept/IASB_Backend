The IASB noted that through novation to a CCP, a party (Party A) to the original derivative has new contractual rights to cash flows from a (new) derivative with the CCP, and this new contract replaces the original contract with a counterparty (Party B). Thus the original derivative with Party B has expired and as a consequence the original derivative through which Party A has engaged with Party B shall meet the derecognition criteria for a financial asset.<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS39_FN0142" type="fn"/></p></body></paragraph>
