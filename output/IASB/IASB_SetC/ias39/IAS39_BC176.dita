Such assets contain a prepayment option whose fair value changes as interest rates change. However, the derivative that is used as the hedging instrument typically is not prepayable, ie it does not contain a prepayment option. When interest rates change, the resulting change in the fair value of the hedged item (which is prepayable) differs from the change in fair value of the hedging derivative (which is not prepayable), with the result that the hedge may not meet IAS 39&#x2019;s effectiveness tests.<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS39_FN0116" type="fn"/> Furthermore, prepayment risk may have the effect that the items included in a portfolio hedge fail the requirement<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS39_FN0117" type="fn"/> that a group of hedged assets or liabilities must be &#x2018;similar&#x2019; and the related requirement<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS39_FN0118" type="fn"/> that &#x2018;the change in fair value attributable to the hedged risk for each individual item in the group shall be expected to be approximately proportional to the overall change in fair value attributable to the hedged risk of the group of items&#x2019;.</p> </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IAS39_P5511" base="SL135662">IAS 39<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS39_FN0119" type="fn"/> prohibits the designation of an overall net position (eg the net of fixed rate assets and fixed rate liabilities) as the hedged item. Rather, it requires individual assets (or liabilities), or groups of similar assets (or similar liabilities), that share the risk exposure equal in amount to the net position to be designated as the hedged item. For example, if an entity has a portfolio of CU100 of assets and CU80 of liabilities, IAS 39 requires that individual assets or a group of similar assets of CU20 are designated as the hedged item. However, for risk management purposes, entities often seek to hedge the net position. This net position changes each period as items are repriced or derecognised and as new items are originated. Hence, the individual items designated as the hedged item also need to be changed each period. This requires de&#x2011; and redesignation of the individual items that constitute the hedged item, which gives rise to significant systems needs.</p> </li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IAS39_P5513" base="SL135664">Fair value hedge accounting requires the carrying amount of the hedged item to be adjusted for the effect of changes in the hedged risk.<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS39_FN0120" type="fn"/> Applied to a portfolio hedge, this could involve changing the carrying amounts of many thousands of individual items. Also, for any items subsequently de&#x2011;designated from being hedged, the revised carrying amount must be amortised over the item&#x2019;s remaining life.<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS39_FN0121" type="fn"/> This, too, gives rise to significant systems needs.</p> </li></ol></body></paragraph>
