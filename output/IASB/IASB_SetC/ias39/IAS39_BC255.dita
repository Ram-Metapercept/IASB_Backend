In       doing so, the entity uses the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the       hedged item for changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk. This would include a       risk premium for uncertainty inherent in the hedged risk that market participants would       consider. For example, to measure changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk such       as the IBOR component of a fixed-rate loan, an entity needs to reflect the uncertainty caused       by the reform. When applying a present value technique to calculate the changes in fair value       attributable to the designated risk component, such measurement should reflect market       participants&#x2019; assumptions about the uncertainty arising from the reform.</p></body></paragraph>
