In other words, uncertainty would no longer be present when an entity amends the description of the hedged item, including the description of the designated portion of the cash flows or fair value being hedged, applying <xref href="IAS39_102P.dita" scope="local">paragraph 102P(b) of IAS 39</xref>. Thereafter, applying the requirement in <xref href="IAS39_88.dita" scope="local">paragraph 88(c) of IAS 39</xref>, the assessment of whether the hedged cash flows are still highly probable to occur would be based on the contractual cash flows determined by reference to the alternative benchmark rate.</p></body></paragraph>
