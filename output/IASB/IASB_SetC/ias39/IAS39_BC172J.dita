The Board noted that these principles were important in order for the effectiveness requirements set out in <xref id="IAS39_X1830" base="F16154219" href="IAS39_88.dita#IAS39_88">paragraph 88</xref> to be applied in a meaningful way. The Board also noted that deciding whether designated risks and portions are separately identifiable and reliably measurable requires judgement. However, the Board confirmed that unless the inflation portion is a contractually specified portion of cash flows and other cash flows of the financial instrument are not affected by the inflation portion, inflation is not separately identifiable and reliably measurable and is not eligible for designation as a hedged risk or portion of a financial instrument.</p></body></paragraph>
