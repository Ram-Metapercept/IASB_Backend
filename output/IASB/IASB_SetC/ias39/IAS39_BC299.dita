This is because, as part of the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting to be       applied, IAS 39 requires the formal designation of a hedging relationship to be documented at       inception. The hedge documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the       hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess hedge       effectiveness.</p></body></paragraph>
