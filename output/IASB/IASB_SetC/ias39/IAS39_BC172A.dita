In doing so, they used a segment as an example of a reporting entity. However, <xref base="F16154161" href="../ifrs08/IFRS08_TOC.dita#IFRS08_TOC0001" id="IAS39_X1812">IFRS 8 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Operating Segments</ph></ph></xref> requires disclosure of information that is reported to the chief operating decision maker even if this is on a non&#x2011;IFRS basis. Therefore, the two IFRSs appeared to conflict. In <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Improvements to IFRSs</ph></ph> issued in May 2008 and April 2009, the Board removed from paragraphs 73 and 80 references to the designation of hedging instruments at the segment level.</p></body></paragraph>
