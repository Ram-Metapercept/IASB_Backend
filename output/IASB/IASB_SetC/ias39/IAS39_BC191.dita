It also noted that this approach is consistent with IAS 39,<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS39_FN0129" type="fn"/> whereas designating an overall net position is not. IAS 39<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS39_FN0130" type="fn"/> prohibits an overall net position from being designated as the hedged item, but permits a similar effect to be achieved by designating an amount of assets (or liabilities) equal to the net position.</p></body></paragraph>
