However, the Board acknowledged the diversity in the approaches to the reform or replacement of interest rate benchmarks and the timing of the expected completion across various jurisdictions. The Board was concerned that 12 months would not provide sufficient time across all jurisdictions. At the same time, the Board considered that entities may not be able to have a reasonable expectation that an alternative benchmark rate would satisfy the separately identifiable requirement over a period longer than 24 months.</p></body></paragraph>
