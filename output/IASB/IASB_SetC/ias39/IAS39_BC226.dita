<paragraph id="IAS39_BC226"><paranum>BC226</paranum><prolog><data name="standard_number" value="IAS 39"/><data name="paranum" value="BC226"/></prolog><body><p>The Board noted that the hedge accounting requirements in <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 9</ph></ph> and <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 39</ph></ph> provide a       clear basis for accounting for such uncertainties. In applying these requirements, the       uncertainties about the timing and the amount of future cash flows could affect an entity&#x2019;s       ability to meet those specific forward-looking hedge accounting requirements in the period       when uncertainty is created by the reform. In some cases, solely due to such uncertainties,       entities could be required to discontinue hedge accounting for hedging relationships that       would otherwise qualify for hedge accounting. Also, because of the uncertainties arising from       the reform, entities may not be able to designate new hedging relationships that would       otherwise qualify for hedge accounting applying <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 9</ph></ph> and <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 39</ph></ph>. In some cases,       discontinuation of hedge accounting would require an entity to recognise gains or losses in       profit or loss.</p></body></paragraph>
