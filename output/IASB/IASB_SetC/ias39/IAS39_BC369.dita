However, the Board agreed with respondents&#x2019; concerns that there could be other circumstances in which it would not be impracticable to reinstate the hedging relationship, but such reinstatement would be challenging or would have limited benefit. For example, if the hedging instrument or hedged item has been designated in a new hedging relationship, it appears inappropriate to require entities to reinstate the &#x2018;old&#x2019; (original) hedging relationship and discontinue or unwind the &#x2018;new&#x2019; (valid) hedging relationship. Consequently, the Board added <xref href="IAS39_108I.dita" scope="local">paragraph 108I(b) to IAS 39</xref> to address these concerns.</p></body></paragraph>
