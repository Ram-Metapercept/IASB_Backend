However, the Board noted that the existence of an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, is only one of the requirements in IFRS 9 for a hedging relationship to be highly effective. The Board considered that the requirements in <xref href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_6.4.1.dita" scope="local">paragraph 6.4.1(c) of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 9</ph></ph></xref> are inherently linked and the application of the economic relationship in isolation might not achieve the intended objective and could result in unintended consequences. The Board therefore rejected this approach.</p></body></paragraph>
