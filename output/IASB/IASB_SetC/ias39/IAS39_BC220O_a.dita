They believed that the proposed scope of &#x2018;novation required by laws or regulations&#x2019; is too restrictive and that the scope therefore should be expanded by removing this criterion. In particular, they argued that voluntary novation to a CCP should be provided with the same relief as novation required by laws or regulations. A few respondents further requested that the scope should not be limited to novation to a central counterparty and that novation in other circumstances should also be considered.</p></body></paragraph>
