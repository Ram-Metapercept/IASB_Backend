However, consistent with the Board&#x2019;s objective for Phase 2 (see paragraph BC292) and its objective for Phase 1 (see <xref href="IAS39_BC227.dita" scope="local">paragraph BC227</xref>), the Board considered that discontinuing hedge accounting solely due to the effects of the reform would not always reflect the economic effects of the changes required by the reform on a hedging relationship and therefore would not always provide useful information to users of financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
