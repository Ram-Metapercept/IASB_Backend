Consequently, the Board decided to propose amending <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 39</ph></ph> so that entities would not discontinue hedge accounting solely because the designated portion is no longer separately identifiable as a result of the reform. In the 2019 Exposure Draft, the Board proposed that the separately identifiable requirement for hedges of the benchmark portion of interest rate risk be applied only at the inception of those hedging relationships affected by the reform. </p></body></paragraph>
