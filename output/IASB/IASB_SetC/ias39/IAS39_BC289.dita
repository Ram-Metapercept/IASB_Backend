Since then, public authorities in many jurisdictions have taken steps to implement interest rate benchmark reform and have increasingly encouraged market participants to ensure timely progress towards the reform of interest rate benchmarks, including the replacement of interest rate benchmarks with alternative, nearly risk-free interest rates that are based, to a greater extent, on transaction data (alternative benchmark rates). The progress towards interest rate benchmark reform follows the general expectation that some major interest rate benchmarks will cease to be published by the end of 2021. The term &#x2018;interest rate benchmark reform&#x2019; refers to the market-wide reform of an interest rate benchmark as described in <xref href="IAS39_102B.dita" scope="local">paragraph 102B of IAS 39</xref> (the reform).</p></body></paragraph>
