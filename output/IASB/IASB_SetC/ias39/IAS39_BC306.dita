Therefore, an entity may be required to apply the applicable Phase 2 exceptions in <xref href="IAS39_g102P-102Z3.dita" scope="local">paragraphs 102P&#x2013;102Z2 of IAS 39</xref> at different times, which may result in the designation of a particular hedging relationship being amended more than once. The Phase 2 amendments to the hedge accounting requirements in IAS 39 apply only to the requirements specified in these paragraphs. All other hedge accounting requirements in IAS 39, including the qualifying criteria in <xref href="IAS39_88.dita" scope="local">paragraph 88 of IAS 39</xref>, apply to hedging relationships directly affected by the reform. In addition, consistent with the Board&#x2019;s decision for the Phase 1 amendments (see <xref href="IAS39_BC254.dita" scope="local">paragraph BC254</xref>), the Phase 2 amendments also do not provide an exception from the measurement requirements for a hedging relationship. Therefore, entities apply the requirements in <xref href="IAS39_89.dita" scope="local">paragraphs 89</xref> or <xref href="IAS39_96.dita" scope="local">96 of IAS 39</xref> to account for any changes in the fair value of the hedged items or hedging instruments (also see <xref href="IAS39_gBC315-BC320.dita" scope="local">paragraphs BC315&#x2013;BC320</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
