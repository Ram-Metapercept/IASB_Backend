The Board agreed with respondents that other       hedging relationships could be directly affected by the reform when the reform gives rise to       uncertainties about the timing or the amount of interest rate benchmark-based cash flows of       the hedged item or of the hedging instrument. Therefore, the Board confirmed that the       exceptions would apply to the interest rate benchmark-based cash flows in these situations.       The Board noted that many derivatives, designated in hedging relationships in which there is       no uncertainty about the timing or the amount of interest rate benchmark-based cash flows,       could be indirectly affected by the reform. For example, this would be the case when the       valuation of the derivatives is affected by general uncertainty in the market caused by the       reform. The Board confirmed that the exceptions do not apply to these hedging relationships,       despite the indirect effect the uncertainties arising from the reform could have on the       valuation of derivatives.</p></body></paragraph>
