In their view, existing asset&#x2011;liability management (ALM) systems treat the identified assets and liabilities as a natural hedge. Management&#x2019;s decisions about additional hedging focus on the entity&#x2019;s remaining net exposure. They observe that designation based on a portion of either the assets or the liabilities is not consistent with existing ALM systems and would entail additional systems costs.</p></body></paragraph>
