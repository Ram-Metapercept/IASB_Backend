The IASB noted that the requirement to discontinue hedge accounting meant that although an entity could designate the new derivative as the hedging instrument in a new hedging relationship, this could result in more hedge ineffectiveness, especially for cash flow hedges, compared to a continuing hedging relationship. This is because the derivative that would be newly designated as the hedging instrument would be on terms that would be different from a new derivative, ie it was unlikely to be &#x2018;at-market&#x2019; (for example, a non-option derivative such as a swap or forward might have a significant fair value) at the time of the novation. The IASB also noted that there would be an increased risk that the hedging relationship would fail to fall within the 80&#x2013;125 per cent hedge effectiveness range required by IAS 39. </p></body></paragraph>
