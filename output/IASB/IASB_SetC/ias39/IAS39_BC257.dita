For example, an entity that issues a 5-year floating-rate debt instrument that bears interest at 3-month LIBOR + 1%, could designate as the hedged item either the entire debt instrument (that is, all of the cash flows) or only the 3-month LIBOR portion of the floating-rate debt instrument. Specifically, <xref href="IAS39_81.dita">paragraphs 81</xref> and <xref href="IAS39_AG99F.dita">AG99F of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 39</ph></ph></xref> allow entities to designate only changes in the cash flows or fair value of an item attributable to a specific risk or risks (designated portion), provided that the designated portion is separately identifiable and reliably measurable.</p></body></paragraph>
