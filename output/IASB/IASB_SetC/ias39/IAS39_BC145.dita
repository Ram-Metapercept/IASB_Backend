However, it decided to retain the restriction against designating non&#x2011;derivatives as hedging instruments in hedges of risks other than foreign currency risk. It noted the following arguments in support of this conclusion: </p><ol id="IAS39_L0164" base="SL135600" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IAS39_P5421" base="SL135602">The need for hedge accounting arises in part because derivatives are measured at fair value, whereas the items they hedge may be measured at cost or not recognised at all. Without hedge accounting, an entity might recognise volatility in profit or loss for matched positions. For non&#x2011;derivative items that are not measured at fair value or for which changes in fair value are not recognised in profit or loss, there is generally no need to adjust the accounting of the hedging instrument or the hedged item to achieve matched recognition of gains and losses in profit or loss.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IAS39_P5422" base="SL135604">To allow designation of cash instruments as hedging instruments would diverge from US GAAP: SFAS 133 precludes the designation of non&#x2011;derivative instruments as hedging instruments except for some foreign currency hedges.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IAS39_P5423" base="SL135606">To allow designation of cash instruments as hedging instruments would add complexity to the Standard. More financial instruments would be measured at an amount that represents neither amortised cost nor fair value. Hedge accounting is, and should be, an exception to the normal measurement requirements.</p></li><li><li_value>(d)</li_value> <p id="IAS39_P5424" base="SL135608">If cash instruments were permitted to be designated as hedging instruments, there would be much less discipline in the accounting model because, in the absence of hedge accounting, a non&#x2011;derivative may not be selectively measured at fair value. If the entity subsequently decides that it would rather not apply fair value measurement to a cash instrument that had been designated as a hedging instrument, it can breach one of the hedge accounting requirements, conclude that the non&#x2011;derivative no longer qualifies as a hedging instrument and selectively avoid recognising the changes in fair value of the non&#x2011;derivative instrument in equity (for a cash flow hedge) or profit or loss (for a fair value hedge).</p></li><li><li_value>(e)</li_value> <p id="IAS39_P5425" base="SL135610">The most significant use of cash instruments as hedging instruments is to hedge foreign currency exposures, which is permitted under IAS 39.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
