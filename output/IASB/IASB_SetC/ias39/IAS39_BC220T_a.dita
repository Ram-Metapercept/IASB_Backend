In considering respondents&#x2019; comments, the IASB noted that ED/2013/2 was intended to address a narrow issue&#x2014;novation to CCPs&#x2014;and therefore changing the phrase &#x2018;if and only if&#x2019; to &#x2018;if&#x2019; would target the amendment on the fact patterns that the IASB sought to address. The IASB noted that this would have the effect of requiring an analysis of whether the general conditions for continuation of hedge accounting are satisfied in other cases (for example, as was raised by some respondents, in determining the effect of intragroup novations in consolidated financial statements).</p></body></paragraph>
