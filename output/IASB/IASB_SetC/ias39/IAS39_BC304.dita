<paragraph base="IFRS2020-5" id="IAS39_BC304" principles="no"><paranum>BC304</paranum><prolog><data name="standard_number" value="IAS 39"/><data name="paranum" value="BC304"/></prolog><body><p> Regarding the scope of the required changes to the affected hedging relationships, the Board       acknowledged it may be necessary to amend the designated hedged portion of the cash flows or       fair value being hedged when the hedging relationship is amended to reflect the changes       required by the reform. The Board also noted that the changes required by the reform described       in <xref href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_5.4.6.dita" scope="local">paragraphs 5.4.6&#x2013;5.4.8 of IFRS         9</xref> were implicit in the required amendments to the hedging relationships as proposed       in the 2020 Exposure Draft. In considering the timing of when entities are required to amend       an affected hedging relationship, the Board sought to balance the operational effort needed to       amend the hedging relationships with maintaining the required discipline in the amendments to       hedging relationships. Specifically, it sought to address the challenges associated with       specifying the timing of when entities have to amend hedging relationships as required in         <xref href="IAS39_102P.dita" scope="local">paragraph 102P of IAS 39</xref>&#x2014;particularly in       the context of the large volume of changes that entities may need to make in a relatively       short time&#x2014;while also ensuring that the amendments to hedging relationships are accounted for       in the applicable reporting period.</p></body></paragraph>
