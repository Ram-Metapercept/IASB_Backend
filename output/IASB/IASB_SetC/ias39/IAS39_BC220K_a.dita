In ED/2013/2, the IASB proposed to amend <xref base="F39136467" href="IAS39_91.dita#IAS39_91/IAS39_91_V2" id="IAS39_X1906">paragraphs 91(a)</xref> and <xref base="F39136468" href="IAS39_101.dita#IAS39_101/IAS39_101_V2" id="IAS39_X1907">101(a) of IAS 39</xref> to provide relief from discontinuing hedge accounting when the novation to a CCP is required by new laws or regulations and meets certain criteria. The IASB decided to set the comment period for those proposals to 30 days. The IASB noted that the reduced comment period was necessary because the amendments should be completed urgently because the new laws or regulations to effect CCP clearing of OTC derivatives would come into force within a short period; the contents of the proposed amendments were short; and there was likely to be a broad consensus on the topic.</p></body></paragraph>
