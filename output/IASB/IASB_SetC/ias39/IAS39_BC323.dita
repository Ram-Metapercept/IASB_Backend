This proposed amendment would apply only when an entity assesses retrospective effectiveness on a cumulative basis (ie using the dollar offset method on a cumulative basis). As required by IAS 39, the entity would continue to measure and recognise hedge ineffectiveness by comparing the actual gains or losses on the hedged item to those on the hedging instrument.</p></body></paragraph>
