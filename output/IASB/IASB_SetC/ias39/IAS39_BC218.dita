The Board decided that entities could use any method to assess retrospective effectiveness, but noted that the chosen method would form part of the documentation of the hedging relationship made at the inception of the hedge in accordance with <xref id="IAS39_X1878" base="F16154561" href="IAS39_88.dita#IAS39_88">paragraph 88(a)</xref> and hence could not be decided at the time the retrospective effectiveness test is performed.</p></body></paragraph>
