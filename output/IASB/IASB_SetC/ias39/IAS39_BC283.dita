Applying these exceptions, entities would continue applying hedge accounting when an interest rate benchmark meets the separately identifiable requirement at the inception of the hedging relationship (assuming all other hedge accounting requirements continue to be met). If the Board included an end date for these exceptions, an entity may be required to immediately discontinue hedge accounting because, at some point, as the reform progresses, the designated portion based on the interest rate benchmark may no longer be separately identifiable (for example, as the market for the alternative benchmark rate is established). Such immediate discontinuation of hedge accounting would be inconsistent with the objective of the exception. The Board noted that linking the end of application for these exceptions to contract amendments would not achieve the Board&#x2019;s intention either because, by definition, non-contractually specified designated portions are not explicitly stated in a contract and, therefore, these contracts may not be amended for the reform. This is particularly relevant for fair value hedges of a fixed-rate debt instrument. Therefore, the Board decided that an entity should cease applying the exceptions to a hedging relationship only when the hedging relationship is discontinued applying <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 39</ph></ph>.</p></body></paragraph>
