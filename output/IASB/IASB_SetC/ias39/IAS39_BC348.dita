For items within the scope of paragraph 102Z1 of IAS 39, the separately identifiable requirement has never been satisfied. In contrast, the population of hedging relationships to which the Phase 1 relief applied had already satisfied the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting to be applied. The Board therefore considered that any relief from the separately identifiable requirement in Phase 2 should be temporary.</p></body></paragraph>
