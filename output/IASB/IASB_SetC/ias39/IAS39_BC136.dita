In the original IAS 39, the prospective test was expressed as &#x2018;almost fully offset&#x2019;, whereas the retrospective test was &#x2018;within a range of 80&#x2013;125 per cent&#x2019;. The Board considered whether to amend IAS 39 to permit the prospective effectiveness to be within the range of 80&#x2013;125 per cent rather than &#x2018;almost fully offset&#x2019;. The Board noted that an undesirable consequence of such an amendment could be that entities would deliberately underhedge a hedged item in a cash flow hedge so as to reduce recognised ineffectiveness. Therefore, the Board initially decided to retain the guidance in the original IAS 39.</p></body></paragraph>
