The Board considered that although the objective of the Phase 2 amendments is to provide relief when individual items transition to an alternative benchmark rate, the replacement of items that have expired with items that reference the alternative benchmark rate is a natural consequence of a dynamic hedging relationship.  Therefore, the Board observed that new items designated as part of the group to replace interest rate benchmark-based items that have matured would be allocated to the relevant subgroup based on the benchmark rate being hedged.</p></body></paragraph>
