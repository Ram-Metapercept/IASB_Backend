In particular, they asked how the prospective effectiveness test is to be applied when an entity periodically &#x2018;rebalances&#x2019; a hedge (ie adjusts the amount of the hedging instrument to reflect changes in the hedged item). The Board decided that if the entity&#x2019;s risk management strategy is to change the amount of the hedging instrument periodically to reflect changes in the hedged position, that strategy affects the determination of the term of the hedge. Thus, the entity needs to demonstrate that the hedge is expected to be highly effective only for the period until the amount of the hedging instrument is next adjusted. The Board noted that this decision does not conflict with the requirement in <xref id="IAS39_X1877" base="F16154560" href="IAS39_75.dita#IAS39_75">paragraph 75</xref> that &#x2018;a hedging relationship may not be designated for only a portion of the time period during which a hedging instrument remains outstanding&#x2019;. This is because the entire hedging instrument is designated (and not only some of its cash flows, for example, those to the time when the hedge is next adjusted). However, expected effectiveness is assessed by considering the change in the fair value of the entire hedging instrument only for the period until it is next adjusted.</p></body></paragraph>
