Therefore, an entity could not amend the description of the hedged risk or the hedged item, including the designated portion of the cash flows or fair value being hedged with reference only to an alternative benchmark rate for the whole group. The Board also considered that it would be inconsistent with the objectives of the Phase 2 amendments to require the discontinuation of such a hedging relationship solely because of the effects of the reform. In the Board&#x2019;s view, the same requirements and relief that apply to other hedging relationships should apply to groups of items designated as hedged items, including dynamic hedging relationships.</p></body></paragraph>
