In the Board&#x2019;s view, this outcome would be inconsistent with the Board&#x2019;s objective for Phase 1. Specifically, it would be inconsistent with the objective of the exception to prevent the discontinuation of hedge accounting solely due to the effects of the uncertainties arising from the reform on the actual results of a hedge while recognising all ineffectiveness in the financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
