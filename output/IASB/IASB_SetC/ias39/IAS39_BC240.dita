Interest rate benchmark reform could affect this assessment for hedging relationships that may extend beyond the timing of the reform. That is because entities would have to consider possible changes to the fair value or future cash flows of hedged items and hedging instruments in determining whether a hedging relationship is expected to be highly effective. Consequently, at some point in time, it is possible that entities would not be able to meet the condition in paragraph 88(b) of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 39</ph></ph> solely because of uncertainties arising from the reform.</p></body></paragraph>
