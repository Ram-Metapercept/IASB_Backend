Specifically, when assessing whether the uncertainty arising from the reform is no longer       present, these respondents asked whether that assessment should be performed on an individual       basis (that is, for each individual item within the group or financial instrument within the       combination) or on a group basis (that is, for all items in the group or all financial       instruments in the combination until there is no uncertainty surrounding any of the items or       financial instruments). </p></body></paragraph>
