For example, in a bottom layer approach (see figure 2), if some assets prepay earlier than expected so that the entity revises downward its estimate of the amount of assets in the repricing time period (eg from CU100 to CU90), these reductions are assumed to come first from the unhedged top layer (figure 2(b)). Whether any ineffectiveness arises depends on whether the downward revision reaches the hedged layer of CU20. Thus, if the bottom layer is designated as the hedged item, it is unlikely that the hedged (bottom) layer will be reached and that any ineffectiveness will arise. Conversely, if the top layer is designated (see figure 3), any downward revision to the estimated amount in a repricing time period will reduce the hedged (top) layer and ineffectiveness will arise (figure 3(b)).</p><fig id="IAS39_BC197-figure2"><title id="IAS39_BC197-figure2_TI" indented="yes">Figure 2: Illustrating the effect on changes in prepayments in a bottom layer approach</title><image href="graphics/IAS39_BC197-figure2.pdf" id="IAS39_BC197-figure2-pdf" otherprops="print" placement="inline"/></fig><fig id="IAS39_BC197-figure3"><title id="IAS39_BC197-figure3_TI" indented="yes">Figure 3: Illustrating the effect on changes in prepayments in a top layer approach</title><image href="graphics/IAS39_BC197-figure3.pdf" id="IAS39_BC197-figure3-pdf" otherprops="print" placement="inline"/></fig></body></paragraph>
