Financial statements do not provide financial information about an entity as if it were two separate entities.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IAS39_P5469" base="SL135626">a fundamental principle of consolidation is that intragroup balances and intragroup transactions are eliminated in full. Permitting the designation of internal contracts as hedging instruments would require a change to the consolidation principles.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IAS39_P5470" base="SL135628">it is conceptually wrong to permit an entity to recognise internally generated gains and losses or make other accounting adjustments because of internal transactions. No external event has occurred.</p></li><li><li_value>(d)</li_value> <p id="IAS39_P5471" base="SL135630">an ability to recognise internally generated gains and losses could result in abuse in the absence of requirements about how entities should manage and control the associated risks. It is not the purpose of accounting standards to prescribe how entities should manage and control risks.</p></li><li><li_value>(e)</li_value> <p id="IAS39_P5472" base="SL135632">permitting the designation of internal contracts as hedging instruments violates the following requirements in IAS 39:</p> <ol id="IAS39_L0167" base="SL135633" type="lower-roman"><li><li_value>(i)</li_value> <p id="IAS39_P5473" base="SL135635">the prohibition against designating as a hedging instrument a non&#x2011;derivative financial asset or non&#x2011;derivative financial liability for other than foreign currency risk. To illustrate, if an entity has two offsetting internal contracts and one is the designated hedging instrument in a fair value hedge of a non&#x2011;derivative asset and the other is the designated hedging instrument in a fair value hedge of a non&#x2011;derivative liability, from the entity&#x2019;s perspective the effect is to designate a hedging relationship between the asset and the liability (ie a non&#x2011;derivative asset or non&#x2011;derivative liability is used as the hedging instrument).</p></li><li><li_value>(ii)</li_value> <p id="IAS39_P5474" base="SL135637">the prohibition on designating a net position of assets and liabilities as the hedged item. To illustrate, an entity has two internal contracts. One is designated in a fair value hedge of an asset and the other in a fair value hedge of a liability. The two internal contracts do not fully offset, so the entity lays off the net risk exposure by entering into a net external derivative. In that case, the effect from the entity&#x2019;s perspective is to designate a hedging relationship between the net external derivative and a net position of an asset and a liability.</p></li><li><li_value>(iii)</li_value> <p id="IAS39_P5475" base="SL135639">the option to fair value assets and liabilities does not extend to portions of assets and liabilities.</p></li></ol></li><li><li_value>(f)</li_value> <p id="IAS39_P5476" base="SL135641">the Board is considering separately whether to make an amendment to IAS 39 to facilitate fair value hedge accounting for portfolio hedges of interest rate risk. The Board believes that that is a better way to address the concerns raised about symmetry with risk management systems than permitting the designation of internal contracts as hedging instruments.</p></li><li><li_value>(g)</li_value> <p id="IAS39_P5477" base="SL135643">the Board decided to permit an option to measure any financial asset or financial liability at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. This enables an entity to measure matching asset/liability positions at fair value without a need for hedge accounting.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
