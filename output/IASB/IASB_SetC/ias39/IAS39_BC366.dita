The Board noted that the reasons for the amendment in paragraph 102P of IAS 39 (see <xref href="IAS39_BC300.dita" scope="local">paragraphs BC300&#x2013;BC301</xref>), apply equally in such situations. The Board therefore considered that discontinuation of hedge accounting solely because of amendments an entity made in hedge documentation to reflect appropriately the changes required by the reform, regardless of when those changes occurred, would not provide useful information to users of financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
