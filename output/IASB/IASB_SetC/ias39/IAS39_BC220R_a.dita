In considering respondents&#x2019; comments, the IASB noted that in some cases a CCP has a contractual relationship only with its &#x2018;clearing members&#x2019;, and therefore an entity must have a contractual relationship with a clearing member in order to transact with a CCP; a clearing member of a CCP provides a clearing service to its client who cannot access a CCP directly. The IASB also noted that some jurisdictions are introducing a so-called &#x2018;indirect clearing&#x2019; arrangement in their laws or regulations to effect clearing with a CCP, by which a client of a clearing member of a CCP provides a (indirect) clearing service to its client in the same way as a clearing member of a CCP provides a clearing service to its client. In addition, the IASB observed that an intragroup novation also can occur in order to access a CCP; for example, if only particular group entities can transact directly with a CCP.</p></body></paragraph>
