Those who suggest this view observe that experience shows this probability to be small, usually within 1&#x2013;5 per cent, for some types of co&#x2011;operative. They see no basis for classifying 100 per cent of the members&#x2019; shares as liabilities on the basis of the behaviour of 1 per cent.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
