Unconditional prohibitions like those noted in <xref id="IFRIC02_X0106" base="ACommittee-97" href="IFRIC02_8.dita#IFRIC02_8">paragraph 8</xref> of the consensus prevent the entity from <i>incurring a liability</i> for redemption of all or some of the members&#x2019; shares, regardless of whether it would otherwise be able to satisfy that financial liability. This contrasts with conditional prohibitions that prevent payments being made only if specified conditions&#x2014;such as liquidity constraints&#x2014;are met. Unconditional prohibitions prevent a liability from coming into existence, whereas the conditional prohibitions may only defer the payment of a liability already incurred. Following this analysis, an unconditional prohibition affects classification when an instrument subject to the prohibition is issued or when the prohibition is enacted or added to the entity&#x2019;s governing charter. In contrast, conditional restrictions such as those described in <xref id="IFRIC02_X0107" base="SL209873" href="../ias32/IAS32_19.dita#IAS32_19">paragraphs 19</xref> <xref id="IFRIC02_X0108" base="SL209874" href="../ias32/IAS32_AG25.dita#IAS32_AG25">and AG25 of IAS 32</xref> do not result in equity classification.</p></body></paragraph>
