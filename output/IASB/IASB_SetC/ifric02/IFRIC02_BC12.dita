<paragraph id="IFRIC02_BC12" base="SL42095"><paranum>BC12</paranum><prolog><data name="standard_number" value="IFRIC 2"/><data name="paranum" value="BC12"/></prolog><body><p id="IFRIC02_P0095">The IFRIC considered whether the entity&#x2019;s history of making redemptions should be considered in deciding whether the entity&#x2019;s right to refuse requests is, in fact, unconditional. The IFRIC observed that a history of making redemptions may create a reasonable expectation that all future requests will be honoured. However, holders of many equity instruments have a reasonable expectation that an entity will continue a past practice of making payments. For example, an entity may have made dividend payments on preference shares for decades. Failure to make those payments would expose the entity to significant economic costs, including damage to the value of its ordinary shares. Nevertheless, as outlined in <xref id="IFRIC02_X0103" base="SL209869" href="../ias32/IAS32_AG26.dita#IAS32_AG26">IAS 32 paragraph AG26</xref> (cited in <xref id="IFRIC02_X0104" base="SL209870" href="IFRIC02_A3.dita#IFRIC02_A3">paragraph A3</xref>), a holder&#x2019;s expectations about dividends do not cause a preferred share to be classified as a financial liability.</p></body></paragraph>
