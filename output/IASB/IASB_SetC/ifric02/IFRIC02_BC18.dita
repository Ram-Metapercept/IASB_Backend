Accordingly, the IFRIC decided that the fair value of the financial liability for redemption of members&#x2019; shares redeemable on demand is the maximum amount payable under the redemption provisions of its governing charter or applicable law. The IFRIC also considered situations in which the number of members&#x2019; shares or the amount of paid&#x2011;in capital subject to prohibition against redemption may change. The IFRIC concluded that a change in the level of a prohibition against redemption should lead to a transfer between financial liabilities and equity.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
