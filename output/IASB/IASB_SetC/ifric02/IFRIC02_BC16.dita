The IFRIC also noted that <xref base="SL209875" href="../ias32/IAS32_23.dita#IAS32_23" id="IFRIC02_X0114">paragraph 23 of IAS 32</xref> requires an entity that has entered into an agreement to purchase its own equity instruments to recognise a financial liability for the present value of the redemption amount (eg for the present value of the forward repurchase price, option exercise price or other redemption amount) even though the shares subject to the repurchase agreement are not individually identified.
