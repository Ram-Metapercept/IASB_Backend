This is because it is local laws, regulations and the governing charter in effect at the classification date, together with the terms contained in the instrument&#x2019;s documentation that constitute the terms and conditions of the instrument at that date. Accordingly, an entity does not take into account expected future amendments to local law, regulation or its governing charter.</p></body></paragraph>
