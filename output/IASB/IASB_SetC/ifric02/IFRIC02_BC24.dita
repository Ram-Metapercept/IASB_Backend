Some co&#x2011;operatives may wish to amend their governing charter in order to continue their existing practice under national accounting requirements of classifying members&#x2019; shares as equity. Such amendments usually require a general meeting of members and holding a meeting may not be possible before the effective date of IAS 32.</p></body></paragraph>
