Thus, if an entity is prohibited from redeeming any of its members&#x2019; shares, the shares are not puttable and are equity. On the other hand, if there is no prohibition on redemption and no other conditions apply, members&#x2019; shares are puttable and the shares are financial liabilities. However, in the case of partial prohibitions against redemption, the classification of members&#x2019; shares governed by the same charter will differ, depending on whether such a classification is based on individual members&#x2019; shares or the group of members&#x2019; shares as a whole. For example, consider an entity with a partial prohibition that prevents it from redeeming 99 per cent of the highest number of members&#x2019; shares ever outstanding. The classification based on individual shares considers each share to be potentially puttable and therefore a financial liability. This is different from the classification based on all of the members&#x2019; shares. While each member&#x2019;s share may be redeemable individually, 99 per cent of the highest number of shares ever outstanding is not redeemable in any circumstances other than liquidation of the entity and therefore is equity.</p></body></paragraph>
