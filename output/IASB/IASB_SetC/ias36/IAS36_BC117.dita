However, some respondents to the Exposure Draft asked for additional guidance to clarify the role of internal transfer pricing versus prices in an arm&#x2019;s length transaction when developing cash flow forecasts. The Board decided to address this issue by amending the requirement in (b) above to deal more broadly with cash&#x2011;generating units whose cash flows are affected by internal transfer pricing, rather than just cash&#x2011;generating units whose internally consumed output could be sold on an active market.</p></body></paragraph>
