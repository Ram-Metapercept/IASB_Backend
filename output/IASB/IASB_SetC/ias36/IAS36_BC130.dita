However, the Board&#x2019;s intention in revising IAS 36 was <i>not</i> to reconsider the general approach to impairment testing. Accordingly, the Board decided that it should address concerns over that general approach as part of its future re&#x2011;examination of IAS 36 in its entirety, rather than as part of its Business Combinations project.</p></body></paragraph>
