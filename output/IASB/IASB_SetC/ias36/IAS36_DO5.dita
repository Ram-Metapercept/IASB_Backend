However, they believe that many commentators misunderstood the level at which the Board intended impairment testing to be undertaken. This was demonstrated during the field&#x2011;testing of the Exposure Draft. Furthermore, the provisions of <xref id="IAS36_X0825" base="F16145982" href="IAS36_99.dita#IAS36_99">paragraph 99</xref> of IAS 36, specifying when impairment testing need not be undertaken, provide generous relief from the necessity of making frequent calculations. They would have preferred to meet those objections by specifying that the goodwill impairment test should be at the level set out in US Financial Accounting Standards Board&#x2019;s Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets</ph></ph>.</p></body></paragraph>
