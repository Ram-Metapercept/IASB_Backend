For example, even if the fair value of an asset is lower than its carrying amount, no impairment loss will be recognised if the sum of undiscounted cash flows (without allocation of interest costs) is greater than the asset&#x2019;s carrying amount. This might occur, especially if an asset has a long useful life.</p></body></paragraph>
