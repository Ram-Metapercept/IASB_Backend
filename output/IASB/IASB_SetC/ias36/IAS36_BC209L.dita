The requirement of disclosing the level of the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement of the impaired asset is categorised would, for example, not be applicable to a measurement based on value in use. In addition, the IASB noted that the amendments to <xref id="IAS36_X0802" base="F24882123" href="IAS36_130.dita#IAS36_130/IAS36_130_V2">paragraph 130(f)</xref> would help to align the disclosure requirements for fair value less costs of disposal for impaired assets with the disclosure requirements in <xref id="IAS36_X0803" base="F24882124" href="IAS36_134.dita#IAS36_134/IAS36_134_V2">paragraph 134(e)</xref> for fair value less costs of disposal for each cash-generating unit for which the carrying amount of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives allocated to that unit is significant in comparison with an entity&#x2019;s total carrying amount of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.</p></body></paragraph>
