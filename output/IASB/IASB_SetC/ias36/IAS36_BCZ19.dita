In such cases, the asset&#x2019;s net selling price will differ from the asset&#x2019;s fair value only by the direct incremental costs of disposal. IASC acknowledged that recoverable amount as the higher of net selling price and value in use would sometimes differ from fair value primarily based on market prices (even if the disposal costs are negligible). This is because, as explained in <xref id="IAS36_X0677" base="F16145409" href="IAS36_BCZ17.dita#IAS36_BCZ17">paragraph BCZ17(a)</xref>, the market may not use the same assumptions about future cash flows as an individual enterprise.<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS36_FN0047" type="fn"/></p></body></paragraph>
