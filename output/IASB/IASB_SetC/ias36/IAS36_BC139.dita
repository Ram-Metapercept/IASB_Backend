However, the Board was concerned that in the absence of any guidance on the precise meaning of &#x2018;allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis&#x2019;, some might conclude that when a business combination enhances the value of all of the acquirer&#x2019;s pre&#x2011;existing cash&#x2011;generating units, any goodwill acquired in that business combination should be tested for impairment only at the level of the entity itself. The Board concluded that this should not be the case. Rather, there should be a link between the level at which goodwill is tested for impairment and the level of internal reporting that reflects the way an entity manages its operations and with which the goodwill naturally would be associated. Therefore, it was important to the Board that goodwill should be tested for impairment at a level at which information about the operations of an entity and the assets that support them is provided for internal reporting purposes.</p></body></paragraph>
