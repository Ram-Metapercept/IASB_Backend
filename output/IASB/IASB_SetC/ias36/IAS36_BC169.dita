However, although supporting convergence, the Board was concerned that the SFAS 142 approach would not provide better information than an approach under which goodwill is tested for impairment at a lower level (thereby removing many of the &#x2018;cushions&#x2019; protecting the goodwill from impairment) but with the amount of any impairment loss for goodwill measured in accordance with the one&#x2011;step approach in the previous version of IAS 36.</p></body></paragraph>
