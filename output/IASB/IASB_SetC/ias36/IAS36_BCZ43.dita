The purpose of such a requirement would be to avoid including in an asset&#x2019;s value in use future cash inflows from internally generated goodwill or from synergy with other assets. This would be consistent with IASC&#x2019;s proposal in E60 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Intangible Assets</ph></ph> to prohibit the recognition of internally generated goodwill as an asset.<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS36_FN0051" type="fn"/></p></body></paragraph>
