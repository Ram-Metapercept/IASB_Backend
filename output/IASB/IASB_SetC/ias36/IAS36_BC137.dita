It employed a &#x2018;bottom&#x2011;up/top&#x2011;down&#x2019; approach under which the goodwill was in effect tested for impairment by allocating its carrying amount to each of the smallest cash&#x2011;generating units to which a portion of that carrying amount could be allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis.</p></body></paragraph>
