Under IAS 14, two sets of segments were identified&#x2014;one based on related products and services, and the other on geographical areas. Under IFRS 8, operating segments are identified on the basis of internal reports that are regularly reviewed by the entity&#x2019;s chief operating decision maker in order to allocate resources to the segment and assess its performance. The objective of the change was to improve the disclosure of segment information, not to change the requirements of IAS 36 relating to the allocation of goodwill for impairment testing. The previous wording of the requirement in IAS 36 that each unit or group of units to which goodwill is allocated shall &#x2018;not be larger than a segment based on either the entity&#x2019;s primary or the entity&#x2019;s secondary reporting format determined in accordance with IAS 14&#x2019; has been amended by IFRS 8 to &#x2018;not be larger than an operating segment determined in accordance with IFRS 8&#x2019;. The arguments set out above in support of the original requirement based on segments determined in accordance with IAS 14 support the revised requirements based on segments determined in accordance with the requirements in IFRS 8.</p></body></paragraph>
