Goodwill does not generate cash flows independently of other assets or groups of assets and therefore cannot be measured directly. Instead, it is measured as a residual amount, being the excess of the cost of a business combination over the acquirer&#x2019;s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree&#x2019;s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Moreover, goodwill acquired in a business combination and goodwill generated after that business combination cannot be separately identified, because they contribute jointly to the same cash flows.<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS36_FN0066" type="fn"/></p></body></paragraph>
