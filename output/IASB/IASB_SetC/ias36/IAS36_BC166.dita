Although determining these fair values would not, for some companies, pose significant practical challenges (because, for example, fair value information for their significant assets is readily available), most would need to engage, on a fairly wide scale and at significant cost, independent valuers for some or all of the unit&#x2019;s assets. This is particularly the case for identifying and measuring the fair values of unrecognised internally generated intangible assets.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IAS36_P2929" base="SL149616">determining the fair values of each identifiable asset, liability and contingent liability within an impaired unit is likely to be impracticable for multi&#x2011;segmented manufacturers that operate multi&#x2011;product facilities servicing more than one cash&#x2011;generating unit. For example, assume an entity&#x2019;s primary basis of segmentation is geographical (eg Europe, North America, South America, Asia, Oceania and Africa) and that its secondary basis of segmentation is based on product groups (vaccinations, over&#x2011;the&#x2011;counter medicines, prescription medicines and vitamins/dietary supplements).<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS36_FN0070" type="fn"/> Assume also that:</p> <ol id="IAS36_L0153" base="SL149617" type="lower-roman"><li><li_value>(i)</li_value> <p id="IAS36_P2930" base="SL149619">the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes is one level below primary segment (eg the vitamins business in North America), and that goodwill is therefore tested for impairment at this level;</p></li><li><li_value>(ii)</li_value> <p id="IAS36_P2931" base="SL149621">the plants and distribution facilities in each geographical region manufacture and distribute for all product groups; and</p></li><li><li_value>(iii)</li_value> <p id="IAS36_P2932" base="SL149623">to determine the carrying amount of each cash&#x2011;generating unit containing goodwill, the carrying amount of each plant and distribution facility has been allocated between each product group it services.</p></li></ol></li></ol><p id="IAS36_P2933" base="SL149624">If, for example, the recoverable amount of the North American vitamins unit were less than its carrying amount, measuring the implied value of goodwill in that unit would require a valuation exercise to be undertaken for <i>all</i> North American assets so that a portion of each asset&#x2019;s fair value can then be allocated to the North American vitamins unit. These valuations are likely to be extremely costly and virtually impossible to complete within a reasonable time period (field visit participants&#x2019; estimates ranged from six to twelve months). The degree of impracticability will be even greater for those entities that monitor, and therefore test, goodwill at the segment level.</p></body></paragraph>
