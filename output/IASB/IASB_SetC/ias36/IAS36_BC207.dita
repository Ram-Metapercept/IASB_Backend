For example, field visit participants and respondents argued that: </p><ol id="IAS36_L0168" base="SL149728" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IAS36_P3023" base="SL149730">it would be extremely difficult to distil the recoverable amount calculations into concise but meaningful disclosures because those calculations typically are complex and do not normally result in a single point estimate of recoverable amount&#x2014;a single value for recoverable amount would normally be determined only when the bottom&#x2011;end of the recoverable amount range is less than a cash&#x2011;generating unit&#x2019;s carrying amount. These difficulties make it doubtful that the information, particularly the sensitivity analyses, could be produced on a timely basis.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IAS36_P3024" base="SL149732">disclosing the proposed information, particularly the values assigned to, and the sensitivity of, each key assumption on which recoverable amount calculations are based, could cause significant commercial harm to an entity. Users of financial statements might, for example, use the quantitative disclosures as the basis for initiating litigation against the entity, its board of directors or management in the highly likely event that those assumptions prove less than accurate. The increased litigation risk would either encourage management to use super&#x2011;conservative assumptions, thereby resulting in improper asset write&#x2011;downs, or compel management to engage independent experts to develop all key assumptions and perform the recoverable amount calculations. Additionally, many of the field visit participants expressed concern over the possible impact that disclosing such information might have on their ability to defend themselves in various legal proceedings.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
