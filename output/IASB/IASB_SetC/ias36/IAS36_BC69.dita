However, this does not mean that a comparison of the unit&#x2019;s recoverable amount with its carrying amount immediately after the acquisition will result in the recognition of an impairment loss. The Board observed that:<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS36_FN0058" type="fn"/></p><ol id="IAS36_L0117" base="SL149378" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IAS36_P2608" base="SL149380">recoverable amount is measured in accordance with IAS 36 as the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell. Fair value less costs to sell is defined in the Standard as &#x2018;the amount obtainable from the sale of an asset or cash&#x2011;generating unit in an arm&#x2019;s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, less the costs of disposal.&#x2019;</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IAS36_P2609" base="SL149382">paragraphs 25&#x2013;27 of the Standard provide guidance on estimating fair value less costs to sell. In accordance with that guidance, the best evidence of a recently acquired unit&#x2019;s fair value less costs to sell is likely to be the arm&#x2019;s length price the entity paid to acquire the unit, adjusted for disposal costs and for any changes in economic circumstances between the transaction date and the date at which the estimate is made.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IAS36_P2610" base="SL149384">if the unit&#x2019;s fair value less costs to sell were to be otherwise estimated, it would also reflect the market&#x2019;s assessment of the expected net benefits any acquirer would be able to derive from restructuring the unit or from future capital expenditure on the unit.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
