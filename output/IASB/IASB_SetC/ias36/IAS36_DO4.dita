Messrs Cope and Leisenring are content, however, for the time being to defer consideration of that general measurement issue, pending more research and debate on measurement principles. (They note that the use of fair value would achieve significant convergence with US GAAP.) But a much more rigorous effort must be made to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill, however measured, than the Board&#x2019;s revised impairment test. The &#x2018;two&#x2011;step&#x2019; method originally proposed by the Board in the Exposure Draft of Proposed Amendments to IAS 36 and IAS 38 was a more useful approach to determining the &#x2018;implied value&#x2019; of goodwill. That test should have been retained.</p></body></paragraph>
