In addition, the IASB concluded that the removal of the term &#x2018;material&#x2019; in paragraph 130 should not impact the disclosure requirements in <xref id="IAS36_X0809" base="F24882130" href="IAS36_131.dita#IAS36_131">paragraph 131</xref>. Consequently, the IASB concluded that the rationale for removing the term &#x2018;material&#x2019;, as presented in Exposure Draft ED/2013/1, was still valid and, as a result, the IASB confirmed the removal of that term in the final amendments.</p></body></paragraph>
