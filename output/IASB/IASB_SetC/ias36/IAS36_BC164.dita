Under SFAS 142, goodwill is tested for impairment by first comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes with the carrying amount of that unit. If the fair value of the unit exceeds its carrying amount, the goodwill is regarded as not impaired. An entity need estimate the implied fair value of goodwill (using an approach consistent with that described in <xref id="IAS36_X0766" base="F16145830" href="IAS36_BC160.dita#IAS36_BC160">paragraph BC160</xref>) only if the fair value of the unit is less than its carrying amount.</p></body></paragraph>
