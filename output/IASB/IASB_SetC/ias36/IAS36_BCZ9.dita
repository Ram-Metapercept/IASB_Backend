IASC concluded that, in such cases, an enterprise will either keep the asset or dispose of it. For example, if an enterprise discovers that the service potential of an asset has decreased: </p><ol id="IAS36_L0091" base="SL149171" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IAS36_P2442" base="SL149173">the enterprise may decide to sell the asset if the net proceeds from the sale would provide a higher return on investment than continuing use in operations; or</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IAS36_P2443" base="SL149175">the enterprise may decide to keep the asset and use it, even if its service potential is lower than originally expected.
