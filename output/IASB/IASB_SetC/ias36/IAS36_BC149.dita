However, several stated that under the Board&#x2019;s proposals, goodwill would be tested for impairment at a lower level than under SFAS 142. Nevertheless, they believe that the Board&#x2019;s approach provides users and management with more useful information.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IAS36_P2896" base="SL149576">several round&#x2011;table participants stated that they (or, in the case of audit firm participants, their clients) manage and have available information about their investments in goodwill at a lower level than the level of the SFAS 142 impairment test. They expressed a high level of dissatisfaction at being prevented by SFAS 142 from recognising goodwill impairments that they knew existed at these lower levels, but which &#x2018;disappeared&#x2019; once the lower level units were aggregated with other units containing sufficient &#x2018;cushions&#x2019; to offset the impairment loss.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
