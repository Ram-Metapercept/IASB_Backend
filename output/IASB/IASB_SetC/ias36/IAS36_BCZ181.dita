IASC believed that if the recoverable amount of an obviously impaired asset can be determined for the individual asset, there is no need to estimate the recoverable amount of the asset&#x2019;s cash&#x2011;generating unit. If the recoverable amount of an individual asset cannot be determined, it cannot be said that the asset is obviously impaired because an impairment loss for a cash&#x2011;generating unit relates to all of the assets of that unit.</p></body></paragraph>
