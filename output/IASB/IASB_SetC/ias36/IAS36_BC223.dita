An impairment loss arising from that transitional impairment test is recognised as the effect of a change in accounting principle rather than as an impairment loss.

Therefore, it is possible that such an intangible asset not previously regarded as impaired might be determined to be impaired under SFAS 142.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IAS36_P3078" base="SL149774">the FASB concluded that the preponderance of any transitional impairment losses would be likely to result from the change in impairment testing methods. Treating those losses as stemming from changes in accounting principles is therefore more representationally faithful.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
