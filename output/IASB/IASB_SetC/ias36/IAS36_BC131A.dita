IAS 22 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Business Combinations</ph></ph> required acquired goodwill to be amortised on a systematic basis over the best estimate of its useful life. There was a rebuttable presumption that its useful life did not exceed twenty years from initial recognition. If that presumption was rebutted, acquired goodwill was required to be tested for impairment in accordance with the previous version of IAS 36 at least at each financial year&#x2011;end, even if there was no indication that it was impaired.</p></body></paragraph>
