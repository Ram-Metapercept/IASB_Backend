The reasons are the following: </p><ol base="SL149251" type="lower-alpha" id="IAS36_L0101"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>         <p base="SL149253" id="IAS36_P2493">IASC believed that no preference should be given to the market&#x2019;s expectation of the recoverable amount of an asset (basis for fair value when market values are available and for net selling price) over a reasonable estimate performed by the individual enterprise that owns the asset (basis for fair value when market values are not available and for value in use). For example, an enterprise may have information about future cash flows that is superior to the information available in the marketplace. Also, an enterprise may plan to use an asset in a manner different from the market&#x2019;s view of the best use.</p>       </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>         <p base="SL149255" id="IAS36_P2494">market values are a way to estimate fair value but only if they reflect the fact that both parties, the acquirer and the seller, are willing to enter a transaction. If an enterprise can generate greater cash flows by using an asset than by selling it, it would be misleading to base recoverable amount on the market price of the asset because a rational enterprise would not be willing to sell the asset. Therefore, recoverable amount should not refer only to a transaction between two parties (which is unlikely to happen) but should also consider an asset&#x2019;s service potential from its use by the enterprise.</p>       </li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value>         <p base="SL149257" id="IAS36_P2495">IASC believed that in assessing the recoverable amount of an asset, it is the amount that an enterprise can expect to recover from that asset, including the effect of synergy with other assets, that is relevant.</p>       </li></ol><p base="SL149258" id="IAS36_P2496"><i>The following two examples illustrate the proposal (rejected by IASC) that an enterprise should measure an asset&#x2019;s recoverable amount at its fair value (primarily based on observable market values if these values are available).</i></p><table base="SL78460" frame="all" orient="port" id="IAS36_TAB0039"><tgroup cols="1"><colspec align="left" colnum="1" colsep="0" rowsep="0" colname="C1" colwidth="100*"/><thead><row><entry align="left" colname="C1" rowsep="1" valign="middle">               <p typeface="sansserif" id="IAS36_P2497">Example 1</p>             </entry></row></thead><tbody><row keep_together="1"><entry colname="C1">               <p base="SL149259" id="IAS36_P2498">10 years ago, an enterprise bought its headquarters building for 2,000. Since then, the real estate market has collapsed and the building&#x2019;s market value at balance sheet date is estimated to be 1,000. Disposal costs of the building would be negligible. The building&#x2019;s carrying amount at the balance sheet date is 1,500 and its remaining useful life is 30 years. The building meets all the enterprise&#x2019;s expectations and it is likely that these expectations will be met for the foreseeable future. As a consequence, the enterprise has no plans to move from its current headquarters. The value in use of the building cannot be determined because the building does not generate independent cash inflows. Therefore, the enterprise assesses the recoverable amount of the building&#x2019;s cash&#x2011;generating unit, that is, the enterprise as a whole. That calculation shows that the building&#x2019;s cash&#x2011;generating unit is not impaired.</p>             </entry></row><row><entry colname="C1">               <p base="SL149260" id="IAS36_P2499"><i>Proponents of fair value (primarily based on observable market values if these values are available) would measure the recoverable amount of the building at its market value (1,000) and, hence, would recognise an impairment loss of 500 (1,500 less 1,000), even though calculations show that the building&#x2019;s cash&#x2011;generating unit is not impaired.</i></p>               <p base="SL149261" id="IAS36_P2500"><i>IASC did not support this approach and believed that the building was not impaired.
