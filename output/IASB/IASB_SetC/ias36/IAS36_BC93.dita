The Board decided that it should not try to resolve this latter issue as part of the Business Combinations project&#x2014;decisions on the treatment of tax in value in use calculations should be made only as part of its conceptual project on measurement. Therefore, the Board concluded it should not amend as part of the current revision of IAS 36 the requirement to use pre&#x2011;tax cash flows and pre&#x2011;tax discount rates when measuring value in use.</p></body></paragraph>
