This is because application of the Standard results in a goodwill impairment loss being identified only if the carrying amount of the cash&#x2011;generating unit (group of units) to which the goodwill has been allocated exceeds its recoverable amount, and the impairment test in the previous version of IAS 36 ensures that this will not be the case.</p></body></paragraph>
