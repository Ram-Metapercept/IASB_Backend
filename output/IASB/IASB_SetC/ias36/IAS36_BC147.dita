A reporting unit is an operating segment (as defined in SFAS 131 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information</ph></ph><xref keyref="footnotes/IAS36_FN0068" type="fn"/>) or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. However, two or more components of an operating segment must be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. An operating segment is deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar, if none of its components is a reporting unit, or if it comprises only a single component.</p></body></paragraph>
