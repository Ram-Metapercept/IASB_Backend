However, the nature of impairment tests means that the carrying amounts of such assets and the related assertion that those carrying amounts are recoverable will normally be supported only by management&#x2019;s projections. Therefore, the Board decided to examine ways in which the reliability of the impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite&#x2011;lived intangibles could be improved.
