That amendment required the disclosure of the level of the fair value hierarchy in which the measurement is categorised, and whether (and if so why) there has been a change in the valuation technique used to measure fair value less costs of disposal for such cash-generating units. In developing Exposure Draft ED/2013/1, the IASB did not consider it necessary to amend those disclosure requirements because they were consistent with its intention of aligning the disclosures about fair value less costs of disposal in IAS 36 with the fair value disclosures in IFRS 13. Consequently, the IASB decided to retain the disclosure requirements in <xref id="IAS36_X0796" base="F24807296" href="IAS36_134.dita#IAS36_134/IAS36_134_V2">paragraph 134(e)</xref> and to add, as mentioned in <xref id="IAS36_X0797" base="F24807297" href="IAS36_BC209G.dita#IAS36_BC209G">paragraph BC209G</xref>, requirements for similar disclosures in <xref id="IAS36_X0798" base="F24807298" href="IAS36_130.dita#IAS36_130/IAS36_130_V2">paragraph 130(f)</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
