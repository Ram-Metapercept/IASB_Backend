Unlike US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which use an undiscounted cash flow screening mechanism for impairment testing long&#x2011;lived assets other than goodwill, IAS 36 requires the recoverable amount of an asset or cash&#x2011;generating unit to be measured whenever there is an indication of possible impairment. Therefore, if at the time of impairment testing a &#x2018;larger&#x2019; unit to which goodwill has been allocated there is an indication of a possible impairment in an asset or &#x2018;smaller&#x2019; cash&#x2011;generating unit included in that larger unit, an entity is required to test that asset or smaller unit for impairment first. Consequently, the Board concluded that it would be reasonable in an IAS 36 context to presume that an impairment loss for the larger unit would, after all other assets and smaller units are assessed for impairment, be likely to relate to the goodwill in the unit. Such a presumption would not be reasonable if an entity were following US GAAP.</p></body></paragraph>
