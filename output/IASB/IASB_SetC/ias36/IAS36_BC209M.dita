When developing these proposals, the IASB concluded that it was unnecessary to state explicitly that the disclosure requirements in paragraph 130 relate to assets (including goodwill) or cash-generating units, for which a material impairment loss has been recognised or reversed during the period, because all IFRSs are governed by the concept of materiality as described in <xref base="F24882126" href="../ias01/IAS01_TOC.dita#IAS01_TOC0001" id="IAS36_X0805"><ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 1</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Presentation of Financial Statements</ph></ph></xref> (see paragraph 31 of IAS 1) and <xref base="F24882127" href="../ias08/IAS08_TOC.dita#IAS08_TOC0001" id="IAS36_X0806"><ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 8</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors</ph></ph></xref>. Some respondents to Exposure Draft ED/2013/1 were opposed to removing this term because they thought that, by removing it, it would become unclear whether the disclosure requirements in paragraph 130 apply only when a material impairment loss has been recognised or reversed during the period. They were also concerned that the elimination of the term &#x2018;material&#x2019; in paragraph 130 could impact the understanding of the requirements in <xref base="F24882128" href="IAS36_131.dita#IAS36_131" id="IAS36_X0807">paragraph 131</xref> that deal with the disclosure of immaterial items on an aggregate basis.</p></body></paragraph>
