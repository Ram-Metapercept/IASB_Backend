Therefore, entities should be required to disclose information that assists users in evaluating the reliability of the estimates used by management to support the carrying amounts of goodwill and indefinite&#x2011;lived intangibles. The Board noted that almost all field visit participants and many respondents expressed explicit support of its conclusion that, because non&#x2011;amortisation of goodwill and indefinite&#x2011;lived intangibles increases the reliance that must be placed on impairment tests of those assets, some additional disclosure is necessary to provide users with information for evaluating the reliability of those impairment tests.</p></body></paragraph>
