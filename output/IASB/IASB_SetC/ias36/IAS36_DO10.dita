As explained above, it merely substitutes the outcome cash flow for the estimate, which should have a clear meaning and provides a safeguard against over&#x2011;optimism in the estimation of cash flows. If corrections of estimates of other elements, such as variations that have occurred in interest rates, were considered important in this context, they could be incorporated in the calculation. <xref id="IAS36_X0833" base="F16145990" href="IAS36_BC197.dita#IAS36_BC197">Paragraph BC197(b)</xref> seems to raise the same point as <xref id="IAS36_X0834" base="F16145991" href="IAS36_BC197.dita#IAS36_BC197">paragraph BC197(a)</xref>, as to the meaning of the impairment loss under the test. <xref id="IAS36_X0835" base="F16146022" href="IAS36_BC197.dita#IAS36_BC197">Paragraph BC197(c)</xref> complains about the excessive burden that a subsequent cash flow test might impose. Professor Whittington notes that the extent of the burden depends, of course, upon the frequency with which the test is applied. He also notes that the extensive disclosure requirements currently associated with the impairment test might be reduced if the subsequent cash flow test were in place.</p></body></paragraph>
