Some respondents questioned the usefulness of that illustrative example, which did not illustrate all of the disclosures that are required for the recoverable amount of impaired assets based on fair value less costs of disposal. In their view, such an illustrative example could be misleading rather than helpful, because it might suggest that no other disclosures are required. On the basis of these comments, and because the IASB noted that <xref id="IAS36_X0814" base="F24882167" href="../ifrs13/IFRS13_gIE60-IE60.dita#IFRS13_gIE60-IE60">Illustrative Example 15 to IFRS 13</xref> includes similar disclosures to the ones included in the proposed illustrative example, it decided not to incorporate the proposed example in the final amendments.</p></body></paragraph>
