The Board could see no justification for amending this approach to require risk adjustments for uncertainty to be factored into the cash flows, particularly given the Board&#x2019;s inclination to avoid modifying the requirements in the previous version of IAS 36 for determining recoverable amount until it considers and resolves the broader question of measurement in accounting. Additionally, the Board as part of its consultative process conducted field visits and round&#x2011;table discussions during the comment period for the Exposure Draft.<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS36_FN0055" type="fn"/> Many field visit participants indicated a preference for reflecting such risk adjustments in the discount rate.</p></body></paragraph>
