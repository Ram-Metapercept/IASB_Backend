However, the Board also concluded that when an operation within that cash&#x2011;generating unit is being disposed of, it is appropriate to presume that some amount of goodwill is associated with that operation. Thus, an allocation of the goodwill should be required when the part of the cash&#x2011;generating unit being disposed of constitutes an operation.</p></body></paragraph>
