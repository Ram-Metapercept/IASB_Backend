First, the failure to eliminate the shield from impairment provided by the internally generated goodwill of the acquiring entity at acquisition. This is discussed in <xref id="IAS36_X0826" base="F16145983" href="IAS36_DO7.dita#IAS36_DO7">paragraph DO7</xref>. Second, the lack of a subsequent cash flow test. This is discussed in <xref id="IAS36_X0827" base="F16145984" href="IAS36_DO8.dita#IAS36_DO8">paragraphs DO8&#x2013;DO10</xref>. The inability to eliminate the shield from impairment provided by internally generated goodwill accruing after the acquisition date is also a problem. However, there is no obvious practical way of dealing with this problem within the framework of conventional impairment tests.</p></body></paragraph>
