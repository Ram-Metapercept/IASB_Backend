The Board&#x2019;s view is that acquirers should be allowed a longer period to complete the goodwill allocation, because that allocation often might not be able to be performed until after the initial accounting for the combination is complete. This is because the cost of the combination or the fair values at the acquisition date of the acquiree&#x2019;s identifiable assets, liabilities or contingent liabilities, and therefore the amount of goodwill acquired in the combination, would not be finalised until the initial accounting for the combination in accordance with <xref base="F16145794" href="../ifrs03/IFRS03_TOC.dita#IFRS03_TOC0001" id="IAS36_X0760">IFRS 3</xref> is complete.</p></body></paragraph>
