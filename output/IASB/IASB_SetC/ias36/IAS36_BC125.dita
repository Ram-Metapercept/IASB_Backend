However, the Board acknowledged that, as outlined in <xref id="IAS36_X0742" base="F16145712" href="IAS36_BC124.dita#IAS36_BC124">paragraph BC124(b)</xref>, impairment tests for indefinite&#x2011;lived intangibles will sometimes be linked to impairment tests for goodwill, and that many entities would find it difficult to perform all those tests at the end of the annual period.</p></body></paragraph>
