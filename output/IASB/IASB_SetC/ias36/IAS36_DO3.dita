However, if goodwill is not amortised, its special nature mandates that it should be accounted for with caution. The <xref base="F16145950" href="IAS36_BC131_DELETED.dita#IAS36_BC131" id="IAS36_X0823">Basis for Conclusions on IAS 36 (paragraph BC131)</xref> states that &#x2018;if a rigorous and operational impairment test [for goodwill] could be devised, more useful information would be provided to users of an entity&#x2019;s financial statements under an approach in which goodwill is not amortised, but instead tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill might be impaired.&#x2019; Messrs Cope and Leisenring agree with that statement. However, they believe that the impairment test to which a majority of the Board has agreed lacks the rigour to satisfy that condition.</p></body></paragraph>
