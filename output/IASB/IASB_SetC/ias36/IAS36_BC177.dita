However, again consistently with its conclusions about indefinite&#x2011;lived intangibles, the Board concluded that this would be the case only if the last recoverable amount determination exceeded the carrying amount of the unit (group of units) by a substantial margin, and nothing had happened since that last determination to make the likelihood of an impairment loss other than remote. The Board concluded that in such circumstances, permitting a detailed calculation of the recoverable amount of a cash&#x2011;generating unit (group of units) to which goodwill has been allocated to be carried forward from the preceding period for use in the current period&#x2019;s impairment test would significantly reduce the costs of applying the impairment test, without compromising its integrity.</p></body></paragraph>
