For example, assume an acquiree is integrated with one of the acquirer&#x2019;s pre&#x2011;existing cash&#x2011;generating units that did not include any goodwill in its carrying amount. Assume also that almost immediately after the business combination the acquirer disposes of a loss&#x2011;making operation within the cash&#x2011;generating unit. The Board agreed with respondents that in such circumstances, it might reasonably be concluded that no part of the carrying amount of goodwill has been disposed of, and therefore no part of its carrying amount should be derecognised by being included in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal.</p></body></paragraph>
