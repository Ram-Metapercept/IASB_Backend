In developing the revised version of <xref id="IAS36_X0721" base="F16145597" href="../ias12/IAS12_TOC0001.dita#IAS12_TOC0001">IAS 12</xref> (approved in 1996), there was not enough support to require that deferred tax assets and liabilities should be measured on a discounted basis. IASC believed there was still not consensus to support such a change in existing practice. Therefore, IAS 36 requires an enterprise to measure the tax effects of temporary differences using the principles set out in <xref id="IAS36_X0722" base="F16145628" href="../ias12/IAS12_TOC0001.dita#IAS12_TOC0001">IAS 12</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
