Furthermore, no preference should be given to the market&#x2019;s expectation of the recoverable amount of an asset (basis for net selling price) over a reasonable estimate performed by the individual enterprise which owns the asset (basis for value in use) or vice versa (see <xref id="IAS36_X0679" base="F16145438" href="IAS36_BCZ17.dita#IAS36_BCZ17">paragraphs BCZ17&#x2013;BCZ20</xref> and <xref id="IAS36_X0680" base="F16145439" href="IAS36_BCZ22.dita#IAS36_BCZ22">BCZ22</xref>). It is uncertain whether the assumptions of the market or the enterprise are more likely to be true. Currently, perfect markets do not exist for many of the assets within the scope of IAS 36 and it is unlikely that predictions of the future will be entirely accurate, regardless of who makes them.</p></body></paragraph>
