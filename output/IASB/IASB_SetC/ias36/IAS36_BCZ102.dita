Therefore, it is relevant to consider the time value of money and the risks specific to an asset in determining whether an asset is impaired. This is particularly true if an asset has a long useful life.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IAS36_P2793" base="SL149469">IAS 36 does not require an enterprise to estimate the recoverable amount of each [depreciable] asset every year but only if there is an indication that an asset may be materially impaired. An asset that is depreciated (amortised) in an appropriate manner is unlikely to become materially impaired unless events or changes in circumstances cause a sudden reduction in the estimate of recoverable amount.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IAS36_P2794" base="SL149471">probability factors are already encompassed in the determination of value in use, in projecting future cash flows and in requiring that recoverable amount should be the higher of net selling price and value in use.</p></li><li><li_value>(d)</li_value> <p id="IAS36_P2795" base="SL149473">if there is an unfavourable change in the assumptions used to determine recoverable amount, users are better served if they are informed about this change in assumptions on a timely basis.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
