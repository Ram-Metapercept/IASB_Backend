For example, information that assists users in evaluating the reliability of the amount recognised for a provision is relevant because it helps users to evaluate the effect of both a past event (ie the economic consequences of the past event giving rise to the present obligation) and a future event (ie the amount of the expected future outflow of economic benefits required to settle the obligation). Accordingly, <xref base="F16145909" href="../ias37/IAS37_TOC.dita#IAS37_TOC0001" id="IAS36_X0779">IAS 37 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets</ph></ph></xref> requires an entity to disclose, for each class of provision, information about the uncertainties surrounding the amount and timing of expected outflows of economic benefits, and the major assumptions concerning future events that may affect the amount required to settle the obligation and have been reflected in the amount of the provision.</p></body></paragraph>
