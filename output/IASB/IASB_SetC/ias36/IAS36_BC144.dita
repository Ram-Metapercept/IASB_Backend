The Board concluded that this amendment is necessary to ensure that entities managed on a matrix basis are able to test goodwill for impairment at the level of internal reporting that reflects the way they manage their operations.<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS36_FN0067" type="fn"/></p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
