That definition affects the determination of the largest unit permitted by <xref id="IAS36_X0753" base="F16145787" href="IAS36_80.dita#IAS36_80">paragraph 80</xref> of IAS 36 for testing goodwill for impairment. In 2008 the Board was made aware that divergent views had developed regarding the largest unit permitted by IAS 36 for impairment testing of goodwill. One view was that the unit is the operating segment level as defined in <xref id="IAS36_X0754" base="F16145788" href="../ifrs08/IFRS08_5.dita#IFRS08_5">paragraph 5 of IFRS 8</xref> <i>before</i> the aggregation permitted by <xref id="IAS36_X0755" base="F16145789" href="../ifrs08/IFRS08_12.dita#IFRS08_12">paragraph 12 of IFRS 8</xref>. The other view was that the unit is the operating segment level as defined in paragraph 5 of IFRS 8 <i>after</i> the aggregation permitted by paragraph 12 of IFRS 8. The Board noted that the lowest level of the entity at which management monitors goodwill as required in <xref id="IAS36_X0756" base="F16145790" href="IAS36_80.dita#IAS36_80">paragraph 80(a)</xref> is the same as the lowest level of operating segments at which the chief operating decision maker regularly reviews operating results as defined in IFRS 8. The Board also noted that the linkage of the entity&#x2019;s goodwill monitoring level with the entity&#x2019;s internal reporting level is intentional, as described in paragraph BC140. The Board noted that aggregating operating segments for goodwill impairment testing into a unit larger than the level at which goodwill is monitored contradicts the rationale underlying IAS 36, as set out in <xref id="IAS36_X0757" base="F16145791" href="IAS36_BC145.dita#IAS36_BC145">paragraphs BC145&#x2013;BC150</xref>. In addition, meeting the aggregation criteria of similar economic characteristics permitted in IFRS 8 does not automatically result in groups of cash&#x2011;generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of allocated goodwill. Similarly, the aggregated segments do not necessarily represent business operations that are economically interdependent or work in concert to recover the goodwill being assessed for impairment. Therefore, in <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Improvements to IFRSs</ph></ph> issued in April 2009, the Board amended paragraph 80(b) to state that the required unit for goodwill impairment in IAS 36 is not larger than the operating segment level as defined in paragraph 5 of IFRS 8 before the permitted aggregation.</p></body></paragraph>
