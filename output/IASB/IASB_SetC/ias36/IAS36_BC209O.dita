That sentence stated that an &#x201C;&#x2026; entity is not required to provide the disclosures required by IFRS 13&#x201D;. The IASB noted that <xref base="F24882165" href="../ifrs13/IFRS13_TOC.dita#IFRS13_TOC0001" id="IAS36_X0811">IFRS 13</xref> already excludes from the scope of its disclosure requirements assets for which the recoverable amount is fair value less costs of disposal in accordance with IAS 36. As a result, the IASB concluded that that sentence in paragraph 130(f) was redundant and could cause confusion and therefore decided to remove it from the final amendments.</p></body></paragraph>
