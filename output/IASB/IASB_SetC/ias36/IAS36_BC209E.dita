As described in <xref base="F24807289" href="IAS36_BC209B.dita#IAS36_BC209B" id="IAS36_X0789">paragraphs BC209B&#x2013;BC209D</xref>, those amendments resulted from the IASB&#x2019;s decision to require the disclosure of the recoverable amount of impaired assets and additional disclosures about the measurement of the recoverable amount of impaired assets when the recoverable amount was based on fair value less costs of disposal. The IASB also intended to retain a balance between the disclosures about fair value less costs of disposal and the disclosures about value in use.</p></body></paragraph>
