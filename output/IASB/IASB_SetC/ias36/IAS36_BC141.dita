Additionally, field visit participants and respondents were unclear about the reference in paragraph 74 of the Exposure Draft to &#x2018;the lowest level at which management monitors the return on investments in assets that include goodwill&#x2019;, the most frequent question being &#x2018;what level of management?&#x2019; (eg board of directors, chief executive officer, or segment management).</p></body></paragraph>
