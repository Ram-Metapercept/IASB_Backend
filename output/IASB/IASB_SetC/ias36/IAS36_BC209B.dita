The Board noted that the disclosure requirements in IAS 36 were developed specifically to ensure consistency in the disclosure of information about impaired assets so that the same type of information is provided whether the recoverable amount  was determined on the basis of value in use  or fair value less costs of disposal. Consequently, the Board did not think it would be appropriate to require an entity to provide information when the recoverable amount is determined on the basis of fair value less costs of disposal (ie those required in IFRS 13) that is significantly different from what the entity would provide when the recoverable amount is determined on the basis of value in use.</p></body></paragraph>
