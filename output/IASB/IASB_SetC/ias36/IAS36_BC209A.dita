These differing requirements appear inconsistent when a similar valuation methodology (discounted cash flows) has been used. Therefore, as part of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Improvements to IFRSs</ph></ph> issued in May 2008, the Board decided to require the same disclosures for fair value less costs to sell and value in use when discounted cash flows are used to estimate recoverable amount.</p></body></paragraph>
