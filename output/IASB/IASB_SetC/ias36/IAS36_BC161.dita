The Board concluded that a method similar to the method an acquirer uses to allocate the cost of a business combination to the net assets acquired could be used to measure the recoverable amount of goodwill after its initial recognition. Thus, the Board decided that some measure of the net assets of a cash&#x2011;generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated should be subtracted from the recoverable amount of that unit to determine a current implied value for the goodwill. The Board concluded that the measure of the net assets of a cash&#x2011;generating unit described in <xref id="IAS36_X0765" base="F16145829" href="IAS36_BC160.dita#IAS36_BC160">paragraph BC160(b)</xref> would result in the best estimate of the current implied value of the goodwill, given that goodwill generated internally after a business combination could not be measured separately.</p></body></paragraph>
