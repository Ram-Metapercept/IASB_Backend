For example, although IAS 36 specified discounting pre&#x2011;tax cash flows at a pre&#x2011;tax discount rate&#x2014;with the pre&#x2011;tax discount rate being the post&#x2011;tax discount rate adjusted to reflect the specific amount and timing of the future tax cash flows&#x2014;it did not specify <i>which</i> tax effects the pre&#x2011;tax rate should include. Arguments could be mounted for various approaches.</p></body></paragraph>
