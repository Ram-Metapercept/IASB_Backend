The following example illustrates this point:</p><lq> <p id="IAS36_P2882" base="SL149557">A company managed on a matrix basis is organised primarily on a geographical basis, with product groups providing the secondary basis of segmentation. Goodwill is acquired as part of an acquisition of a product group that is present in several geographical regions, and is then monitored on an ongoing basis for internal reporting purposes as part of the product group/secondary segment. It is feasible that the secondary segment might, depending on the definition of &#x2018;larger&#x2019;, be &#x2018;larger&#x2019; than a primary segment.</p></lq></body></paragraph>
