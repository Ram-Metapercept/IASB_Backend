The logic of this argument is that an impairment loss arises only where there is a reduction in the estimated future cash flows that form part of the business&#x2019;s operating activities. Indeed, according to <xref base="F16145637" href="../ias16/IAS16_TOC.dita#IAS16_TOC0001" id="IAS36_X0727">IAS 16</xref>, whether or not an asset is revalued, the depreciation charge is always recognised in the income statement. Supporters of this view question why the treatment of an impairment loss on a revalued asset should be different to depreciation.</p></body></paragraph>
