The first step involved using a screening mechanism for identifying potential goodwill impairments, whereby goodwill allocated to a cash&#x2011;generating unit would be identified as potentially impaired only when the carrying amount of the unit exceeded its recoverable amount. If an entity identified the goodwill allocated to a cash&#x2011;generating unit as potentially impaired, an entity would then determine whether the goodwill allocated to the unit was impaired by comparing its recoverable amount, measured as the &#x2018;implied value&#x2019; of the goodwill, with its carrying amount. The implied value of goodwill would be measured as a residual, being the excess of: </p><ol id="IAS36_L0150" base="SL149597" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IAS36_P2916" base="SL149599">the recoverable amount of the cash&#x2011;generating unit to which the goodwill has been allocated, over</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IAS36_P2917" base="SL149601">the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities the entity would recognise if it acquired the cash&#x2011;generating unit in a business combination on the date of the impairment test (excluding any identifiable asset that was acquired in a business combination but not recognised separately from goodwill at the acquisition date).</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
