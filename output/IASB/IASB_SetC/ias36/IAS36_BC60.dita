Although the cash flows used as the starting point in the calculation represent entity&#x2011;specific cash flows (ie they are derived from the most recent financial budgets/forecasts approved by management and represent management&#x2019;s best estimate of the set of economic conditions that will exist over the remaining useful life of the asset), their present value is required to be determined using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. <xref id="IAS36_X0699" base="F16145516" href="IAS36_56.dita#IAS36_56">Paragraph 56</xref> of the Standard (paragraph 49 of the previous version of IAS 36) clarifies that &#x2018;A rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset is the return that investors would require if they were to choose an investment that would generate cash flows of amounts, timing and risk profile equivalent to those that the entity expects to derive from the asset.&#x2019; In other words, an asset&#x2019;s value in use reflects how the market would price the cash flows that management expects to derive from that asset.</p></body></paragraph>
