Thus, the pre&#x2011;existing internally generated goodwill of the acquirer provides a shield against impairment additional to that provided by subsequent internally generated goodwill. Professor Whittington believes that the impairment test would be more rigorous if it included a requirement similar to that in UK Financial Reporting Standard 11 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Impairment of Fixed Assets and Goodwill</ph></ph>, which recognises, for purposes of impairment testing, the implied value of the acquirer&#x2019;s goodwill existing at the time of acquisition.</p></body></paragraph>
