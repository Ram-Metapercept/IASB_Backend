The IASB concluded that it was unlikely that those terms could have different meanings because IFRS 13 defines &#x2018;inputs&#x2019; as &#x201C;the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability&#x2026;&#x201D;. In addition, the IASB wanted to make clear that the proposed amendments did not change the meaning of the information that is required to be disclosed in accordance with IAS 36. On the basis of that analysis and given that the use of the term &#x2018;assumptions&#x2019; was not questioned by the respondents to Exposure Draft ED/2013/1, the IASB decided to retain that term in the final amendments.</p></body></paragraph>
