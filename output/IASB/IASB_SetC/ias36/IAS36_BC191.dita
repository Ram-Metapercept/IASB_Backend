As discussed in <xref id="IAS36_X0777" base="F16145906" href="IAS36_BC135.dita#IAS36_BC135">paragraph BC135</xref>, the Board is of the view that it is not possible to devise an impairment test for acquired goodwill that removes the cushion against the recognition of impairment losses provided by goodwill generated internally after a business combination.</p></body></paragraph>
