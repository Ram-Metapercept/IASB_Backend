The Board nevertheless agreed with respondents that the requirement for value in use to be based on the most recent forecasts approved by management could be viewed as inconsistent with <xref id="IAS36_X0709" base="F16145556" href="IAS36_37.dita#IAS36_37">paragraph 37</xref> of the previous version of IAS 36 when those forecasts include either future restructurings to which the entity is not yet committed or future cash flows associated with improving or enhancing the asset&#x2019;s performance.</p></body></paragraph>
