An impairment loss, when recognised, is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its recoverable amount measured at fair value (based on quoted market prices or, if no quoted market prices exist, estimated considering prices for similar assets and the results of valuation techniques, such as the sum of cash flows discounted to their present value, option&#x2011;pricing models, matrix pricing, option&#x2011;adjusted spread models and fundamental analysis).<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS36_FN0062" type="fn"/></p></body></paragraph>
