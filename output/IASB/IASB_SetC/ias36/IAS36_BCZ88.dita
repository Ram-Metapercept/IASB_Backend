In such cases, some believe that the value in use of an asset, or a cash&#x2011;generating unit, should be adjusted to reflect the tax consequences of recovering its pre&#x2011;tax value in use. For example, if the tax rate is 25 per cent, an enterprise must receive pre&#x2011;tax cash flows with a present value of 400 in order to recover a carrying amount of 300.</p></body></paragraph>
