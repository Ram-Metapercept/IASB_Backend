For the same reason, the IASB also proposed to amend <xref id="IAS36_X0793" base="F24807293" href="IAS36_130.dita#IAS36_130/IAS36_130_V2">paragraph 130(f)</xref> to require additional information about the fair value measurement when the recoverable amount of impaired assets is based on fair value less costs of disposal, consistently with the disclosure requirements for impaired assets in US GAAP. As mentioned in <xref id="IAS36_X0794" base="F24807294" href="IAS36_BC209C.dita#IAS36_BC209C">paragraph BC209C</xref>, although IFRS and US GAAP have different impairment models, the IASB had concluded that requiring that additional information about impaired assets measured at fair value less costs of disposal would improve comparability between the disclosures presented in the financial statements of entities applying IFRS and the disclosures presented in the financial statements of those applying US GAAP.</p></body></paragraph>
