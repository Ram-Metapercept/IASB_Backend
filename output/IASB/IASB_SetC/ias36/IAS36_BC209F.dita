Instead of requiring the disclosure of the recoverable amount for impaired assets, that amendment required the disclosure of the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit for which the carrying amount of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives allocated to that unit is significant when compared to an entity&#x2019;s total carrying amount of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.</p></body></paragraph>
