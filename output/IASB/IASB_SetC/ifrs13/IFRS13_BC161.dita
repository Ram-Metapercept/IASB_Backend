Furthermore, the exposure draft stated that the bid&#x2011;ask spread guidance applied at all levels of the fair value hierarchy, when bid and ask prices are relevant (see paragraph BC165), and did not preclude the use of mid&#x2011;market pricing or other pricing conventions that are used by market participants as a practical expedient. </p></body></paragraph>
