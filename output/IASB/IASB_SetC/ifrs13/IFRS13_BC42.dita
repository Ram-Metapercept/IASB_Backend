It is not necessarily the same as the price an entity paid to acquire an asset or received to incur a liability, eg if that transaction was not at arm&#x2019;s length.  In discussions with interested parties, the IASB found that most people who assert that an asset or a liability should be measured using an entry price measurement basis, rather than an exit price measurement basis, would actually prefer to use the entity&#x2019;s actual transaction price (or cost), not the market&#x2011;based current entry price defined above. The IASB observed that in some cases there is not an actual transaction price (eg when a group of assets is acquired but the unit of account is an individual asset, or when a biological asset regenerates) and, as a result, an assumed, or hypothetical, price must be used.</p></body></paragraph>
