In other words, could the fair value be less than the amount payable on demand, discounted from the first date that an amount could be required to be paid (the demand amount), such as the amount of the deposit discounted for the period that the entity expects the deposit to be outstanding? Some commentators believed that the fair value of financial liabilities with a demand feature is less than the demand amount, for reasons that include the consistency of such measurement with how those financial liabilities are treated for risk management purposes.</p></body></paragraph>
