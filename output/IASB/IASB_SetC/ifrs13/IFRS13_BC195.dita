Such measurements might be categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the boards concluded that an entity should be required to disclose how it has measured the fair value of the asset or liability, but that it should not need to create quantitative information (eg an implied market multiple or future cash flows) to comply with the disclosure requirement if quantitative information other than the prior transaction price or third&#x2011;party pricing information is not used when measuring fair value. However, the boards concluded that when using a prior transaction price or third&#x2011;party pricing information, an entity cannot ignore other quantitative information that is reasonably available. If there was an adjustment to the price in a prior transaction or third&#x2011;party pricing information that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety, that adjustment would be an unobservable input about which the entity would disclose quantitative information even if the entity does not disclose the unobservable information used when pricing the prior transaction or developing the third&#x2011;party pricing information.</p></body></paragraph>
