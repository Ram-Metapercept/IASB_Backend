They found the descriptions of valuation adjustments in the IASB&#x2019;s Fair Value Expert Advisory Panel&#x2019;s October 2008 report <i>Measuring and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments in markets that are no longer active</i> helpful (see paragraph BC177). In addition, regulators asked the IASB to address measurement uncertainty to ensure that fair value measurements are not overstated or understated in the statement of financial position, thus improving the quality of information available to users of financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
