They reasoned that such descriptions and guidance would be too prescriptive because the application of premiums and discounts in a fair value measurement depends on the facts and circumstances at the measurement date. In the boards&#x2019; view, different facts and circumstances might lead to particular premiums or discounts being relevant for some assets and liabilities but not for others (eg in different jurisdictions). Furthermore, the boards did not intend to preclude the use of particular premiums or discounts, except for blockage factors.</p></body></paragraph>
