Therefore, the IASB considered it unnecessary to make a distinction between a current entry price and a current exit price in IFRSs with a market&#x2011;based measurement objective (ie fair value), and the IASB decided to retain the term fair value and define it as a current exit price.</p></body></paragraph>
