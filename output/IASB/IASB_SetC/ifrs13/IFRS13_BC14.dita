The boards concluded that having common requirements for fair value measurement and disclosure would improve the comparability of financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRSs and US GAAP. In addition, they concluded that having common requirements would reduce diversity in the application of fair value measurement requirements and would simplify financial reporting. To achieve those goals, the boards needed to ensure that fair value had the same meaning in IFRSs and US GAAP and that IFRSs and US GAAP had the same fair value measurement and disclosure requirements (except for minor differences in wording and style). Consequently, the FASB agreed to consider the comments received on the IASB&#x2019;s exposure draft and to propose amendments to US GAAP if necessary.</p></body></paragraph>
