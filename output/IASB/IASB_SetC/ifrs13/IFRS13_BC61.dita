However, the IASB noted that the costs may differ depending on how a particular entity enters into a transaction. Therefore, the IASB concluded that transaction costs are not a characteristic of an asset or a liability, but a characteristic of the transaction. That decision is consistent with the requirements for measuring fair value already in IFRSs. An entity accounts for those costs in accordance with relevant IFRSs.</p></body></paragraph>
