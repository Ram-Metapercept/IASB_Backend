However, the FASB was aware that before the amendments Topic 820 was sometimes interpreted more broadly than the FASB intended, such as when an entity used the in&#x2011;use valuation premise to measure the fair value of a group of financial assets when the entity did not have offsetting positions in a particular market risk (or risks) or counterparty credit risk. That interpretation led the IASB to propose requiring the in&#x2011;exchange valuation premise for financial assets in its exposure draft.</p></body></paragraph>
