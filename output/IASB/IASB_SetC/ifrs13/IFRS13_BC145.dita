As a result, the boards decided to describe the valuation adjustments that entities might need to make when using a valuation technique because market participants would make those adjustments when pricing a financial asset or financial liability under the market conditions at the measurement date, including adjustments for measurement uncertainty. Those valuation adjustments include the following:</p><ol id="IFRS13_L0104" base="F16133212" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS13_P2318" base="F16133213">an adjustment to a valuation technique to take into account a characteristic of an asset or a liability that is not captured by the valuation technique (the need for such an adjustment is typically identified during calibration of the value calculated using the valuation technique with observable market information). </p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS13_P2319" base="F16133215">applying the point within the bid&#x2011;ask spread that is most representative of fair value in the circumstances. </p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS13_P2320" base="F16133217">an adjustment to take into account non&#x2011;performance risk (eg an entity&#x2019;s own credit risk or the credit risk of the counterparty to a transaction). </p></li><li><li_value>(d)</li_value> <p id="IFRS13_P2321" base="F16133219">an adjustment to take into account measurement uncertainty (eg when there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity when compared with normal market activity for the asset or liability, or similar assets or liabilities, and the entity has determined that the transaction price or quoted price does not represent fair value). </p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
