Respondents to the exposure draft expressed concerns about being required to use observable inputs during the global financial crisis that started in 2007 when the available observable inputs were not representative of the asset or liability being measured at fair value.  Given that feedback, the IASB wanted to ensure that observability was not the only criterion applied when selecting the inputs to a valuation technique. Consequently, IFRS 13 focuses on <i>relevant</i> observable inputs  because the IASB noted that in some cases the available observable inputs will require an entity to make significant adjustments to them given the characteristics of the asset or liability and the circumstances at the measurement date (eg market conditions). </p></body></paragraph>
