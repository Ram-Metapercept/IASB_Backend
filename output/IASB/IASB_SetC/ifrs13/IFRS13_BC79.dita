When a market price does not capture the characteristics of the asset (eg if that price represents the use of the asset on a stand&#x2011;alone basis, not installed or otherwise configured for use, rather than in combination with other assets, installed and configured for use), that price will not represent fair value. In such a situation, an entity will need to measure fair value using another valuation technique  (such as an income approach)  or the cost to replace or recreate the asset (such as a cost approach)  depending on the circumstances and the information available.</p></body></paragraph>
