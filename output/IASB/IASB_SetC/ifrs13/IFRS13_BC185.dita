To meet those objectives, the disclosure framework (a) combines the disclosures currently required by IFRSs and US GAAP and (b) provides additional disclosures that users of financial statements suggested would be helpful in their analyses. In developing the disclosures, the IASB used information received from users and preparers of financial statements and the IASB&#x2019;s Fair Value Expert Advisory Panel. </p></body></paragraph>
