In IAS 39 other adjustments to arrive at fair value (eg for counterparty credit risk )  were not included in the term <i>bid&#x2011;ask spread</i>. Some respondents asked whether the proposed bid&#x2011;ask guidance reflected that view. Although the boards decided not to specify what, if anything, is in a bid&#x2011;ask spread besides transaction costs, in the boards&#x2019; view the bid&#x2011;ask spread does not include adjustments for counterparty credit risk (see paragraphs BC124&#x2013;BC127 for a discussion on adjustments for counterparty credit risk when measuring fair value). Therefore, an entity will need to make an assessment of what is in the bid&#x2011;ask spread for an asset or a liability when determining the point within the bid&#x2011;ask spread that is most representative of fair value in the circumstances. </p></body></paragraph>
