The IASB decided to limit the disclosures to fair values measured in the statement of financial position after initial recognition, whether those measurements are made on a recurring or non&#x2011;recurring basis,  because other IFRSs address the disclosure of fair values at initial recognition (eg IFRS 3 requires disclosure of the measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination ).</p></body></paragraph>
