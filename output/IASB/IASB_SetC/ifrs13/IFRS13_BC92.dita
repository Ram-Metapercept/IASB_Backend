Non&#x2011;performance risk includes, but is not limited to, an entity&#x2019;s own credit risk (credit standing). That is consistent with the fair value measurement guidance already in IFRSs. For example, IAS 39<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS13_FN0019" type="fn"/> and <xref base="F43926898" href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_TOC.dita#IFRS09_TOC0001" id="IFRS13_X1007">IFRS 9</xref> referred to making adjustments for credit risk if market participants would reflect that risk when pricing a financial instrument. However, there was inconsistent application of that principle because:</p> <ol base="F36867678" id="IFRS13_L0101" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p base="F36867680" id="IFRS13_P2239">IAS 39 and <xref base="F68123497" href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_TOC.dita#IFRS09_TOC0001" id="IFRS13_X1008">IFRS 9</xref> refer to credit risk generally and do not specifically refer to the reporting entity&#x2019;s <i>own</i> credit risk; and</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p base="F36867683" id="IFRS13_P2240">there were different interpretations about how an entity&#x2019;s own credit risk should be reflected in the fair value of a liability using the settlement notion in the previous definition of fair value because it is unlikely that the counterparty would accept a different amount as settlement of the obligation if the entity&#x2019;s credit standing changed.</p></li></ol></variant></body></paragraph>
