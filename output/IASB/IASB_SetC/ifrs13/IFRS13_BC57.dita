That is consistent with the proposal in the exposure draft. Given that proposal, some respondents noted that in some jurisdictions entities often have common ownership (eg state&#x2011;owned enterprises or entities with cross ownership) and questioned whether transactions observed in those jurisdictions would be permitted as an input into a fair value measurement. The boards decided to clarify that the price in a related party transaction may be used as an input into a fair value measurement if the entity has evidence that the transaction was entered into at market terms. The boards concluded that this is consistent with <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 24</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Related Party Disclosures</ph></ph>. </p></body></paragraph>
