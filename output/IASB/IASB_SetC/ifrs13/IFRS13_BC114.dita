That proposal, combined with a proposed amendment to IAS 39 about the unit of account for financial instruments, led respondents to believe that the fair value of financial assets cannot reflect the fact that those assets are held within a portfolio, even when an entity manages its financial instruments on the basis of the entity&#x2019;s net exposure, rather than its gross exposure, to market risks and credit risk.</p></body></paragraph>
