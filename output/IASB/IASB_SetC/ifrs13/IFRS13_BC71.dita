The IASB concluded that an entity that seeks to maximise the value of its assets  would use those assets at their highest and best use and that it would be necessary for an entity to consider alternative uses of those assets only if there was evidence that the current use of the assets is not their highest and best use (ie an alternative use would maximise their fair value). Furthermore, after discussions with valuation professionals, the IASB concluded that in many cases it would be unlikely for an asset&#x2019;s current use not to be its highest and best use after taking into account the costs to convert the asset to the alternative use.</p></body></paragraph>
