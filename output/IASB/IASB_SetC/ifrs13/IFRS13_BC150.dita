The exposure draft focused on the need to adjust for the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value, such as a pricing model (model risk) and the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique (input risk).  That proposal was consistent with US GAAP.</p></body></paragraph>
