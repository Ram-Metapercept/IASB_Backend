In reaching their decision, the boards considered whether the effects of illiquidity could create a difference between those values. The boards noted that the effects of illiquidity are difficult to differentiate from credit&#x2011;related effects. The boards concluded that there was no conceptual reason why the liability value would diverge from the corresponding asset value in the same market because the contractual terms are the same,  unless the unit of account for the liability is different from the unit of account for the asset  or the quoted price for the asset relates to a similar (but not identical) liability held as an asset. </p></body></paragraph>
