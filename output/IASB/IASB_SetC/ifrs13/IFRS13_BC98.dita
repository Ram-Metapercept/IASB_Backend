When the unit of account for such liabilities is the obligation without the credit enhancement, the fair value of the liability from the issuer&#x2019;s perspective will not equal its fair value as a guaranteed liability held by another party as an asset. Therefore, the fair value of the guaranteed liability held by another party as an asset would need to be adjusted because any payments made by the guarantor in accordance with the guarantee result in a transfer of the issuer&#x2019;s debt obligation from the investor to the guarantor. The issuer&#x2019;s resulting debt obligation to the guarantor has not been guaranteed. Consequently, the boards decided that if the third&#x2011;party credit enhancement is accounted for separately from the liability, the fair value of that obligation takes into account the credit standing of the issuer and not the credit standing of the guarantor.</p></body></paragraph>
