The IASB did not intend to change the measurement requirements for those short-term receivables and payables, noting that <xref base="F35271403" href="../ias08/IAS08_8.dita#IAS08_8" id="IFRS13_X1106">paragraph 8 of IAS 8</xref> already permits entities not to apply accounting policies set out in accordance with IFRSs when the effect of applying them is immaterial.</p></body></paragraph>
