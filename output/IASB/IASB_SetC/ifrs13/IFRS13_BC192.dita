The boards noted that the objective of the disclosure is not to enable users of financial statements to replicate the entity&#x2019;s pricing models, but to provide enough information for users to assess whether the entity&#x2019;s views about individual inputs differed from their own and, if so, to decide how to incorporate the entity&#x2019;s fair value measurement in their decisions. The boards concluded that the information required by the disclosure will facilitate comparison                     of the inputs used over time, providing users with information about changes in management&#x2019;s views about particular unobservable inputs and about changes in the market for the assets and liabilities within a particular class. In addition, that disclosure might facilitate comparison between entities with similar assets and liabilities categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.</p></body></paragraph>
