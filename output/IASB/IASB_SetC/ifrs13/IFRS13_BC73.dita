As a result, the boards decided that when an entity uses a non&#x2011;financial asset in a way that differs from its highest and best use (and that asset is measured at fair value), the entity must simply disclose that fact and why the asset is being used in a manner that differs from its highest and best use (see paragraphs BC213 and BC214). </p></body></paragraph>
