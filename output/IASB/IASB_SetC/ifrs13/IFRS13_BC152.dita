That proposal in effect would have prohibited the application of premiums and discounts related to the size of an entity&#x2019;s holding in a fair value measurement categorised within any level of the fair value hierarchy for financial instruments within the scope of IAS 39. The IASB proposed that amendment for the following reasons:</p> <ol id="IFRS13_L0106" base="F36867750" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS13_P2336" base="F36867752">The unit of account  for a financial instrument should not depend on an instrument&#x2019;s categorisation within the fair value hierarchy. </p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS13_P2337" base="F36867759">Market participants will enter into a transaction to sell a financial instrument that maximises the fair value of an asset or minimises the fair value of a liability.  An entity&#x2019;s decision to sell at a less advantageous price because it sells an entire holding rather than each instrument individually is a factor specific to that reporting entity. </p></li></ol></variant></body></paragraph>
