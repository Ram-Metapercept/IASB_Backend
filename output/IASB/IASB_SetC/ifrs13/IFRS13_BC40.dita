Even if an entity intends to fulfil the obligation over time, an exit price embodies expectations of related cash outflows because a market participant transferee would ultimately be required to fulfil the obligation. Thus, the IASB concluded that an exit price is always a relevant definition of fair value for liabilities, regardless of whether an entity intends to fulfil the liability or transfer it to another party that will fulfil it. </p></body></paragraph>
