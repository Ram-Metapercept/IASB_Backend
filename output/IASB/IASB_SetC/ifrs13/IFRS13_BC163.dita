Having clarified the fair value measurement objective,  the IASB concluded that an entity should use judgement in meeting that objective. Accordingly, IFRS 13 states that a fair value measurement should use the price within the bid&#x2011;ask spread that is most representative of fair value in the circumstances, and that the use of bid prices for asset positions and ask prices for liability positions is permitted but is not required.</p></body></paragraph>
