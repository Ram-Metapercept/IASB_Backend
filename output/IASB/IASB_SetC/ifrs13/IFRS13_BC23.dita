In its project to amend IAS 19 the IASB decided to require an entity to disaggregate the fair value of the plan assets into classes that distinguish the risk and liquidity characteristics of those assets, subdividing each class of debt and equity instruments into those that have a quoted market price in an active market and those that do not. As a result, the IASB decided that an entity does not need to provide the disclosures required by IFRS 13 for the fair value of plan assets or retirement benefit plan investments. </p></body></paragraph>
