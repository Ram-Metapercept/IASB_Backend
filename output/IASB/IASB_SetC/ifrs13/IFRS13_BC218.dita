Some respondents (mainly users of financial statements) noted that the disclosures about impaired assets are different in IFRSs and in US GAAP (which requires assets to be tested for impairment by comparing their carrying amounts with their fair values) and asked the IASB to minimise those differences to ensure that users have access to similar information for their analyses of impaired assets.</p></body></paragraph>
