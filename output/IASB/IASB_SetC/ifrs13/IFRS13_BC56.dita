The IASB concluded that the previous definition expressed the same notion as the definition of fair value in IFRS 13, but that the previous definition was less clear. Thus, IFRS 13 defines market participants  as buyers and sellers in the principal (or most advantageous) market for the asset or liability who are independent of each other (ie they are not related parties), knowledgeable about the asset or liability, and able and willing to enter into a transaction for the asset or liability.</p></body></paragraph>
