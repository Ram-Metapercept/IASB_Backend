However, Topic 820 did not specify whether a blockage factor (or another premium or discount, such as a control premium or a non&#x2011;controlling interest discount) should be applied in a fair value measurement categorised within Level 2  or Level 3  of the fair value hierarchy if market participants would take it into account when pricing the asset or liability.</p></body></paragraph>
