The boards decided this because an entity that can provide evidence that it manages its financial instruments on the basis of its net risk exposure would do so consistently for a particular portfolio from period to period, and not on a net basis for that portfolio in some periods and on a gross basis in other periods. Some respondents to the FASB&#x2019;s proposed ASU found that requirement limiting because they noted that the composition of a portfolio changes continually as the entity rebalances the portfolio and changes its risk exposure preferences over time. Although the entity does not need to maintain a static portfolio, the boards decided to clarify that the entity must make an accounting policy decision (in accordance with <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 8</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors</ph></ph>) to use the exception described in paragraphs BC118 and BC119.  The boards also decided that the accounting policy decision could be changed if the entity&#x2019;s risk exposure preferences change. In that case the entity can decide not to use the exception but instead to measure the fair value of its financial instruments on an individual instrument basis. However, if the entity continues to value a portfolio using the exception, it must do so consistently from period to period.</p></body></paragraph>
