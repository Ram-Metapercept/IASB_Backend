An entity derives no incremental value from holding a financial asset within a portfolio.  Furthermore, the IASB noted that the valuation premise related only to assets, not to liabilities, and as such could not be applied to portfolios of financial instruments that include financial liabilities. Therefore, the exposure draft proposed that the in&#x2011;exchange valuation premise must be used to measure the fair value of a financial asset. The IASB also proposed an amendment to IAS 39 making it explicit that the unit of account for financial instruments is the individual financial instrument at all levels of the fair value hierarchy (Level 1, 2 or 3).</p></body></paragraph>
