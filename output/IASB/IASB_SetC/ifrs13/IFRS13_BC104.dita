Respondents to the discussion paper asked for explicit guidance for measuring the fair value of such instruments because Topic 820 did not contain explicit guidance. Consequently, the boards decided to describe how an entity should measure the fair value of its own equity instruments (eg when an acquirer issues equity in consideration for an acquiree in a business combination). </p></body></paragraph>
