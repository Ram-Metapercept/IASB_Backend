If the liability was traded as an asset, the observed price would also represent the fair value of the issuer&#x2019;s liability. If there was no corresponding asset (eg as would be the case with a decommissioning liability), the fair value of the liability could be measured using a valuation technique, such as the present value of the future cash outflows that market participants would expect to incur in fulfilling the obligation.</p></body></paragraph>
