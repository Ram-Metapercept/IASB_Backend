IFRS 7 required such a disclosure for financial instruments after it was amended in March 2009 to introduce a three&#x2011;level fair value hierarchy, and to require more detailed information about fair value measurements categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. In addition, many IFRSs already required a similar reconciliation for all fair value measurements, not only for those that are categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.</p></body></paragraph>
