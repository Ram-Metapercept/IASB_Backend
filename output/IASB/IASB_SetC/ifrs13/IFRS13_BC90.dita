Topic 820 contained such a requirement. Respondents asked for clarification on the meaning of compensation that a market participant would require for taking on the obligation. Therefore, the boards decided to provide additional guidance about the compensation that market participants would require , such as the compensation for taking on the responsibility of fulfilling an obligation  and for assuming the risk associated with an uncertain obligation  (ie the risk that the actual cash outflows might differ from the expected cash outflows). The boards concluded that including this description will improve the application of the requirements for measuring the fair value of liabilities that are not held as assets.</p></body></paragraph>
