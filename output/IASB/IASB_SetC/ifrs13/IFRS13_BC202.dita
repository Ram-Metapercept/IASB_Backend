That proposal was taken from the requirement in IFRS 7 to disclose a sensitivity analysis if changing any of the unobservable inputs used in the measurement to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would change the fair value significantly. Although in IFRS 7 that disclosure was required for financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value, under the proposal it would have been required for all assets and liabilities measured at fair value.</p></body></paragraph>
