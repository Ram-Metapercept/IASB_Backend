Even when an asset is used in combination with other assets,  the exit price for the asset is a price for that asset individually because a fair value measurement assumes that a market participant (buyer) of the asset already holds the complementary assets and the associated liabilities. Because the buyer is assumed to hold the other assets (and liabilities) necessary for the asset to function, that buyer would not be willing to pay more for the asset solely because it was sold as part of a group. That conclusion is consistent with the conclusion reached in IFRS 3 for measuring the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired in a business combination.</p></body></paragraph>
