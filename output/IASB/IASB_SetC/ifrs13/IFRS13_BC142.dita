The IASB concluded that determining the appropriateness of valuation techniques in the circumstances requires judgement and noted that Topic 820 and the fair value measurement guidance already in IFRSs do not contain a hierarchy of valuation techniques. For example, IAS 41 acknowledged that in some cases the various approaches used by an entity might suggest different fair value conclusions for a biological asset or agricultural produce, but that the entity should consider the reasons for the differences to arrive at a fair value within a reasonable range.</p></body></paragraph>
