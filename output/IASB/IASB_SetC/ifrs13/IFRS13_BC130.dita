They reasoned that fair value measurements are meant to reflect (a) the risk exposure faced by the entity and (b) how that risk exposure would be priced by market participants (which is one reason the boards decided to permit the exception; see paragraph BC117). When pricing financial instruments, a market participant would take into account the other instruments it holds to the extent that those instruments reduce or enhance its overall risk exposure. That is a consequence of requiring or permitting financial instruments to be measured at fair value. The boards&#x2019; considerations for requiring net or gross presentation of financial instruments are different from those for requiring net or gross measurement. </p></body></paragraph>
