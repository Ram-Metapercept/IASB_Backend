Other respondents thought that the disclosure requirement would be onerous and did not believe that the benefits would outweigh the costs, particularly for non&#x2011;financial assets and liabilities. The IASB received similar feedback on the proposed amendments to IFRS 7. However, users of financial statements told the IASB that the disclosures made in accordance with US GAAP and IFRS 7 were helpful, particularly in the light of the global financial crisis that started in 2007. They indicated that the disclosures allowed them to make more informed judgements and to segregate the effects of fair value measurements that are inherently subjective, thereby enhancing their ability to assess the quality of an entity&#x2019;s reported earnings. Consequently, the IASB decided to require an entity to provide such a reconciliation.</p></body></paragraph>
