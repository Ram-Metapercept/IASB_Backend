In many cases the unit of account for a financial instrument for financial reporting is the individual financial instrument.  In such cases the size of an entity&#x2019;s holding is not relevant in a fair value measurement. An entity would realise a blockage factor when that entity decides to enter into a transaction to sell a block consisting of a large number of identical assets or liabilities. Therefore, blockage factors are conceptually similar to transaction costs in that they will differ depending on how an entity enters into a transaction for an asset or a liability. The boards concluded that if an entity decides to enter into a transaction to sell a block, the consequences of that decision should be recognised when the decision is carried out regardless of the level of the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurement is categorised. </p></body></paragraph>
