In that project, the IASB considered whether differences between the definitions of fair value in US GAAP (an explicit exit price) and IFRSs (an exchange amount, which might be interpreted in some situations as an entry price) would result in different measurements of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. That was a particularly important issue because in many business combinations the assets and liabilities are non&#x2011;financial.</p></body></paragraph>
