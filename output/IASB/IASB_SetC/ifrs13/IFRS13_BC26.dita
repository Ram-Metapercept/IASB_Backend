In the light of the comments received, the IASB confirmed its decision when developing IAS 39 that the fair value of financial liabilities with a demand feature cannot be less than the present value of the demand amount (see <xref href="IFRS13_47.dita#IFRS13_gBC101-BCZ103" id="IFRS13_BC26_link">paragraphs BC101&#x2013;BCZ103</xref>) and decided to retain the term <i>fair value</i> for such financial liabilities.                        </p>         </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>           <p base="F36867638" id="IFRS13_P2128">The exposure draft proposed replacing the term <i>fair value</i> with another term that reflects the measurement objective for reacquired rights in a business combination in IFRS 3 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Business Combinations</ph></ph>.                          In the redeliberations, the IASB concluded that because IFRS 3 already describes the measurement of reacquired rights as an exception to fair value, it was not necessary to change that wording.</p>         </li></ol>     </variant></body></paragraph>
