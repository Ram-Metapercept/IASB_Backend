Entities in developed economies faced similar challenges during the global financial crisis that started in 2007 and asked the IASB for guidance for measuring the fair value of equity instruments without active markets given the requirement to recognise them at fair value in IFRS 9.  Furthermore, the IASB concluded that there should not be a different threshold for measuring fair value depending on jurisdiction. Only by performing fair value measurements will entities applying IFRSs learn how to do those measurements appropriately and robustly.</p></body></paragraph>
