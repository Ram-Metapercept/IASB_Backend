The boards decided to clarify that in a fair value measurement, an entity must take into account other arrangements that mitigate credit risk, such as an agreement that requires the exchange of collateral on the basis of each party&#x2019;s net exposure to the credit risk of the other party, if market participants would expect such arrangements to be legally enforceable in the event of default.</p></body></paragraph>
