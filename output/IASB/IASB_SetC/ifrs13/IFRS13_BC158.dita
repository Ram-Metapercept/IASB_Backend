IFRS 13 specifies that when a Level 1 input is not available, a fair value measurement should incorporate premiums or discounts if market participants would take them into account in a transaction for the asset or liability. Paragraph BC168 describes the IASB&#x2019;s rationale for requiring an entity to use Level 1 inputs without adjustment whenever available. However, the boards decided to clarify that the application of premiums or discounts must be consistent with the unit of account in the IFRS that requires or permits the fair value measurement. </p></body></paragraph>
