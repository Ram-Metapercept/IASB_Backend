Because the liability is assumed to be transferred to a market participant, the liability remains outstanding and the market participant transferee, like the entity, would be required to fulfil it. The same concept applies to an entity&#x2019;s own equity instrument,  as discussed in paragraphsÂ BC104&#x2013;BC107.</p></body></paragraph>
