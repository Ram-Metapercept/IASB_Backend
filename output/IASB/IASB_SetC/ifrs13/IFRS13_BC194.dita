The boards concluded that for a fair value measurement to be categorised within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the unobservable inputs used, if any, must not be significant to the measurement in its entirety. As a result, the boards decided that quantitative information about unobservable inputs would be of limited use for those measurements.</p></body></paragraph>
