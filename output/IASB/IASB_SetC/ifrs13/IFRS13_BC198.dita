That was because those documents referred to <i>gains or losses attributable to assets and liabilities held at the end of the reporting period</i>, which the IASB meant to be equivalent to unrealised gains or losses (ie realised gains or losses result from the sale, disposal or settlement of an asset or a liability, and therefore the asset or liability is no longer held by the entity at the reporting date, whereas unrealised gains or losses relate to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability that is held by the entity at the reporting date). Respondents to the exposure draft wondered whether the different terminology used in the exposure draft and in Topic 820 meant that the disclosure proposed for IFRSs would be different from the disclosure required by US GAAP. To ensure that there would be no differences in interpretation of the requirements in IFRSs and US GAAP, the IASB decided to use the terms <i>realised</i> and <i>unrealised</i> in the reconciliation disclosure. </p></body></paragraph>
