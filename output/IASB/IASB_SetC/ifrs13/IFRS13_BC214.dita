The boards concluded that because the measurement and disclosure requirements are principle&#x2011;based, those requirements should not need to be amended in the future if the boards should decide to use fair value as the measurement basis for particular assets or liabilities. Therefore, the disclosure is required for any non&#x2011;financial asset measured at fair value that an entity uses in a way that differs from its highest and best use. </p></body></paragraph>
