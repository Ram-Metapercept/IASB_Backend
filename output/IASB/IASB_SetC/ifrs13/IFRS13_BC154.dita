For example, some respondents thought that the IASB intended to prohibit the application of any premiums or discounts (such as a control premium) for fair value measurements categorised within Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy even when market participants would take into account a premium or discount when pricing the asset or liability for a particular unit of account.            </p></body></paragraph>
