They made that decision because users of financial statements told the boards that information about an entity&#x2019;s valuation processes helps them assess the relative subjectivity of the entity&#x2019;s fair value measurements, particularly for those categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.</p></body></paragraph>
