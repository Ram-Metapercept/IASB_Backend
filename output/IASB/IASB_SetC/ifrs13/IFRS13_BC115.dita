In addition, they were concerned about the systems changes that would be necessary to effect a change in practice. To preserve the relationship between financial reporting and risk management, some respondents asked whether they would be able to apply the bid&#x2011;ask  spread guidance to each of the individual instruments so that the sum of the fair values of the individual instruments equals the value of the net position.</p></body></paragraph>
