For example, an entity might buy an asset at the ask price (entry price) and measure fair value using the bid price (exit price). The boards concluded that bid&#x2011;ask spreads are only relevant for financial instruments and in markets in which an intermediary (eg a broker ) is necessary to bring together a buyer and a seller to engage in a transaction (ie when the buyer and seller need an intermediary to find one another). When measuring the fair value of a non&#x2011;financial asset or non&#x2011;financial liability, the notion of a bid&#x2011;ask spread will not be relevant because the buyers and sellers in the principal (or most advantageous) market have already found one another and are assumed to have negotiated the transaction price (ie fair value). </p></body></paragraph>
