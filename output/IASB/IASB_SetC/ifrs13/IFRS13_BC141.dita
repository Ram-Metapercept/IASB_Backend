Some respondents questioned whether a cost approach  is consistent with an exit price definition of fair value  because they think that the cost to replace an asset is more consistent with an entry price than an exit price. The IASB noted that an entity&#x2019;s cost to replace an asset would equal the amount that a market participant buyer of that asset (that would use it similarly) would pay to acquire it (ie the entry price and the exit price would be equal in the same market). Thus, the IASB concluded that the cost approach is consistent with an exit price definition of fair value.</p></body></paragraph>
