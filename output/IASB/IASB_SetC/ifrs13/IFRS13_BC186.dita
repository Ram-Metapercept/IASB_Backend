The exposure draft did not propose differentiating recurring from non&#x2011;recurring fair value measurements and required the same information about all fair value measurements. However, users of financial statements asked the IASB to include the same principles for disclosing information about fair value measurements in IFRSs that are in US GAAP. As a result, the boards decided to differentiate the two types of fair value measurements and to describe their differences.</p></body></paragraph>
