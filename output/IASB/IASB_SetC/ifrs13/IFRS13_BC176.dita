As a result, and consistently with the recommendations of the Group of Twenty (G20) Leaders, the Financial Stability Board and the IASB&#x2019;s and FASB&#x2019;s Financial Crisis Advisory Group, the IASB and the FASB worked together to develop common requirements for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities when markets are no longer active.</p></body></paragraph>
