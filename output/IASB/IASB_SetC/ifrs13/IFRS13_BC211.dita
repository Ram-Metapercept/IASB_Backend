That disclosure was also required in Topic 820. In their discussions, the boards decided instead to require a disclosure of <i>any</i> transfers into or out of Levels 1 and 2. Respondents to the FASB&#x2019;s proposed ASU generally did not support that proposal because it would require an entity to monitor all transfers on a daily basis, regardless of whether those transfers were significant. In addition, respondents were concerned about the accuracy of information about all transfers because there can be an unclear distinction between less active Level 1 fair value measurements and more active Level 2 fair value measurements.</p></body></paragraph>
