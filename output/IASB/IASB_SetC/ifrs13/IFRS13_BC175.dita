Furthermore, they were concerned that their judgement would be questioned when asserting the absence of contrary data. IFRS 13 states that such exhaustive efforts would not be necessary. However, when information about market participant assumptions is reasonably available, an entity cannot ignore it. </p></body></paragraph>
