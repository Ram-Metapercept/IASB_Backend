In IAS 32 an entity may not use net presentation unless specific criteria are met,  whereas in US GAAP many entities are able to use net presentation in their financial statements. However, the criteria for net presentation in US GAAP relate to credit risk, not to market risks. As a result, the presentation and measurement bases are different when an entity applies bid&#x2011;ask adjustments on a net basis but is required to present fair value information on a gross basis (although generally the financial instruments with bid&#x2011;ask adjustments would qualify for net presentation in US GAAP because of the existence of master netting agreements and other credit risk mitigating arrangements).</p></body></paragraph>
