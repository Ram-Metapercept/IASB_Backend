Unlike transaction costs, which arise from a transaction and do not change the characteristics of the asset or liability, transport costs  arise from an event (transport) that does change a characteristic of an asset  (its location). IFRS 13 states that if location is a characteristic of an asset, the price in the principal (or most advantageous) market  should be adjusted for the costs that would be incurred to transport the asset from its current location to that market. That is consistent with the fair value measurement guidance already in IFRSs. For example, IAS 41 required an entity to deduct transport costs when measuring the fair value of a biological asset or agricultural produce.</p></body></paragraph>
