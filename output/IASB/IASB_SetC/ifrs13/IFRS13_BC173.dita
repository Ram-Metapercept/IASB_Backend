They also expressed concerns that unobservable inputs may include entity&#x2011;specific factors that market participants would not consider. Therefore, they suggested that the IASB should use a different label for measurements that use significant unobservable inputs. However, the IASB concluded that it would be more helpful to users of financial statements to use the label <i>fair value</i> for all three levels of the hierarchy described in the exposure draft, for the following reasons:</p><ol id="IFRS13_L0110" base="F16133353" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS13_P2372" base="F16133354">The proposed definition of fair value  identifies a clear objective for valuation techniques and the inputs to them: consider all factors that market participants would consider and exclude all factors that market participants would exclude. An alternative label for Level 3 measurements would be unlikely to identify such a clear objective.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS13_P2373" base="F16133356">The distinction between Levels 2 and 3 is inevitably subjective. It is undesirable to adopt different measurement objectives on either side of such a subjective boundary.</p></li></ol><p id="IFRS13_P2374" base="F16133357">Rather than requiring a different label for measurements derived using significant unobservable inputs,  the IASB concluded that concerns about the subjectivity of those measurements are best addressed by requiring enhanced disclosure for those measurements  (see paragraphs BC187&#x2013;BC210).</p></body></paragraph>
