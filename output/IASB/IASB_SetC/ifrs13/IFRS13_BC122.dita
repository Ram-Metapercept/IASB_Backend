Some respondents to the FASB&#x2019;s proposed ASU asked for additional guidance on what is meant by <i>substantially the same</i> given the different instruments and types of instruments that might make up a portfolio. In addition, they were concerned that the proposed requirement that the market risks be substantially the same meant that there could be no basis risk in the portfolio or, conversely, that the basis risk  would not be reflected in the fair value measurement.</p></body></paragraph>
