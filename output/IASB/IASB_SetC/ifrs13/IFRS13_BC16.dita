As a result of those discussions, in June 2010 the FASB issued a proposed Accounting Standards Update (ASU) <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820): Amendments for Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S GAAP and IFRSs</ph></ph> and the IASB re&#x2011;exposed a proposed disclosure of the unobservable inputs used in a fair value measurement (<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Measurement Uncertainty Analysis Disclosure for Fair Value Measurements</ph></ph>). The IASB concluded that it was necessary to re&#x2011;expose that proposal because in their discussions the boards agreed to require a measurement uncertainty analysis disclosure that included the effect of any interrelationships between unobservable inputs (a requirement that was not proposed in the May 2009 exposure draft and was not already required by IFRSs). The IASB received 92 comment letters on the re&#x2011;exposure document.</p></body></paragraph>
