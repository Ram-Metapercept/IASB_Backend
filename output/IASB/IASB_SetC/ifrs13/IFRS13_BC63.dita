However, a change in characteristics causes that particular asset to become a different asset. The objective of a fair value measurement is to measure the asset that exists at the measurement date.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS13_P2193" base="F16132976">Even though an entity may be able to change the cash flows associated with a liability by relieving itself of the obligation in different ways, the different ways of doing so are not alternative uses. Moreover, although an entity might have entity&#x2011;specific advantages or disadvantages that enable it to fulfil a liability more or less efficiently than other market participants, those entity&#x2011;specific factors do not affect fair value.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS13_P2194" base="F16132978">Those concepts were originally developed within the valuation profession to value non&#x2011;financial assets, such as land.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
