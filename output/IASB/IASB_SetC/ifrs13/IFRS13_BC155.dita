Those respondents understood the boards&#x2019; concerns about verifiability                     within Level 1. Other respondents stated that the fair value measurement should reflect the fair value of the entity&#x2019;s <i>holding</i>, not of each individual instrument within that holding (ie they did not agree that the unit of account for a financial instrument should be a single instrument). Those respondents maintained that the principle should be that the unit of account reflects how market participants would enter into a transaction for the asset or liability. They asserted that market participants would not (and often cannot)              sell individual items. The FASB received similar comments when developing SFAS 157. The boards concluded that such concerns were outside the scope of the fair value measurement project because the project addressed <i>how</i> to measure fair value and not <i>what</i> is measured at fair value.</p></body></paragraph>
