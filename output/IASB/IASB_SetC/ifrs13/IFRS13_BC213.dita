The boards concluded that such a disclosure provides useful                     information for users of financial statements that rely on fair value information when forecasting future cash flows, whether that fair value information is presented in the statement of financial position or is disclosed in the notes. Users told the boards that they would need to know how non&#x2011;financial assets are being used and how that use fits with an entity&#x2019;s strategic and operating plans.</p></body></paragraph>
