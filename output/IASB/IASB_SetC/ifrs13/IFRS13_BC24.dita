In the boards&#x2019; discussions, they concluded that the measurement and disclosure requirements should apply to all measurements for which fair value is the underlying measurement basis (except that the disclosure requirements would not apply to assets with a recoverable amount that is fair value less costs of disposal in IAS 36; see paragraphs BC218&#x2013;BC221).  Consequently, the boards decided to clarify that the measurement and disclosure requirements apply to both fair value measurements and measurements based on fair value. The boards also decided to clarify that the measurement and disclosure requirements do not apply to measurements that have similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realisable value in accordance with IAS 2 or value in use in accordance with IAS 36. </p></body></paragraph>
