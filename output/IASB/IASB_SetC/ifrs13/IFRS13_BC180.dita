However, some respondents noted that the words used in the exposure draft were different from those used in US GAAP and wondered whether the requirements were meant to be different. The boards acknowledged those concerns and decided to align the wording. In addition, the boards decided to clarify that the requirements pertain to when there has been a significant decline in the volume or level of activity for the asset or liability, not to assets and liabilities for which there is typically no observable market.</p></body></paragraph>
