Although the IASB acknowledges that such an assumption is unlikely to be realistic for an actual transaction (because in most cases the reporting entity transferor and the market participant transferee are unlikely to have the same credit standing), the IASB concluded that such an assumption was necessary when measuring fair value for the following reasons:</p><ol id="IFRS13_L0102" base="F16133081" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS13_P2243" base="F16133082">A market participant taking on the obligation would not enter into a transaction that changes the non&#x2011;performance risk associated with the liability without reflecting that change in the price (eg a creditor would not generally permit a debtor to transfer its obligation to another party of lower credit standing, nor would a transferee of higher credit standing be willing to assume the obligation using the same terms negotiated by the transferor if those terms reflect the transferor&#x2019;s lower credit standing).</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS13_P2244" base="F16133084">Without specifying the credit standing of the entity taking on the obligation, there could be fundamentally different fair values for a liability depending on an entity&#x2019;s assumptions about the characteristics of the market participant transferee.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS13_P2245" base="F16133086">Those who might hold the entity&#x2019;s obligations as assets would consider the effect of the entity&#x2019;s credit risk and other risk factors when pricing those assets (see paragraphs BC83&#x2013;BC89).</p></li></ol><p id="IFRS13_P2246" base="F16133087">The FASB reached the same conclusions when developing SFAS 157 and ASU No. 2009&#x2011;05 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820): Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value</ph></ph>.</p></body></paragraph>
