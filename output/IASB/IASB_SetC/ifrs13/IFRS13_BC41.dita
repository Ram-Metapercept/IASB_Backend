If it became evident that a current exit price was not the intention in a particular situation, the IASB would use another measurement basis to describe the objective. The other likely measurement basis candidate was a current entry price. For the standard&#x2011;by&#x2011;standard review, the IASB defined current entry price as follows:</p><lq> <p id="IFRS13_P2155" base="F16132206">The price that would be paid to buy an asset or received to incur a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants (including the amount imposed on an entity for incurring a liability) at the measurement date.</p></lq></body></paragraph>
