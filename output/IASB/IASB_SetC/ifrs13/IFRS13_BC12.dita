In that discussion paper, the IASB used SFAS 157 as a basis for its preliminary views because of the consistency of SFAS 157 with the existing fair value measurement guidance in IFRSs and the need for increased convergence of IFRSs and US GAAP. The IASB received 136 comment letters in response to that discussion paper. In November 2007 the IASB began its deliberations for the development of the exposure draft <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Fair Value Measurement</ph></ph>.</p></body></paragraph>
