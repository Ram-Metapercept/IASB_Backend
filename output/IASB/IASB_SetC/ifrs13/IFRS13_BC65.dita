The boards also concluded that those concepts do not apply to an entity&#x2019;s own equity instruments because those arrangements, similar to financial instruments, typically have specific contractual terms. Paragraphs BC108&#x2013;BC131 describe the boards&#x2019; rationale in developing the requirements for measuring the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities with offsetting positions in market risks and counterparty credit risk.</p></body></paragraph>
