For example, IAS 39 and <xref base="F68126887" href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_TOC.dita#IFRS09_TOC0001" id="IFRS13_X1094">IFRS 9</xref> state that an entity cannot recognise a day 1 gain or loss for a financial instrument unless its fair value is evidenced by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability or based on a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets.  In contrast, IFRS 3 and IAS 41 require the recognition of day 1 gains or losses even when fair value is measured using unobservable inputs.</p></body></paragraph>
