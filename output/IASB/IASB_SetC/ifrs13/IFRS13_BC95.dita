However, many questioned the usefulness of doing so after initial recognition, because they reasoned that it would lead to counter&#x2011;intuitive and potentially confusing reporting (ie gains for credit deterioration and losses for credit improvements). The IASB understands that these concerns are strongly held, but concluded that addressing them was beyond the scope of the fair value measurement project. The purpose of that project was to define fair value, not to determine when to use fair value or how to present changes in fair value. A measurement that does not consider the effect of an entity&#x2019;s non&#x2011;performance risk is not a fair value measurement. The IASB addressed those concerns in developing <xref base="F43926899" href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_TOC.dita#IFRS09_TOC0001" id="IFRS13_X1013">IFRS 9</xref> (issued in October 2010).            </p></body></paragraph>
