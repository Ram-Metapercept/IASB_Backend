The definition of <i>market&#x2011;based value</i> would have been similar to the exit price definition of fair value except that it would specify that the measurement does not take into account market participant assumptions for vesting conditions and reload features.  Respondents pointed out that some items measured at fair value in IFRS 2 were consistent with the proposed definition of fair value, not with the proposed definition of market&#x2011;based value, and were concerned that there could be unintended consequences of moving forward with a market&#x2011;based value measurement basis in IFRS 2. The IASB agreed with those comments and concluded that amending IFRS 2 to distinguish between measures that are fair value and those based on fair value would require new measurement guidance for measures based on fair value. The IASB concluded that such guidance might result in unintended changes in practice with regard to measuring share&#x2011;based payment transactions and decided to exclude IFRS 2 from the scope of IFRS 13. </p></body></paragraph>
