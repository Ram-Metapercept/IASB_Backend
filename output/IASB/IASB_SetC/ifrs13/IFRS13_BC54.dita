However, regardless of whether an entity measures fair value on the basis of the price in the principal market or in the most advantageous market, the fair value measurement takes into account transport costs, but not transaction costs  (see paragraphs BC60&#x2013;BC62 for a discussion on transport and transaction costs). That is consistent with the proposal in the exposure draft.</p></body></paragraph>
