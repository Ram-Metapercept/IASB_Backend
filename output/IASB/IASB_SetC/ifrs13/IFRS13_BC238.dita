Topic 946 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Financial Services&#x2014;Investment Companies</ph></ph> in US GAAP requires an investment company to recognise its underlying investments at fair value at each reporting period. Topic 820 provides a practical expedient that permits an entity with an investment in an investment company to use as a measure of fair value in specific circumstances the reported net asset value without adjustment. <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 10</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Consolidated Financial Statements</ph></ph> requires an investment company to consolidate its controlled underlying investments.  Because IFRSs do not have accounting requirements that are specific to investment companies, the IASB decided that it would be difficult to identify when such a practical expedient could be applied given the different practices for calculating net asset values in jurisdictions around the world. For example, investment companies may report in accordance with national GAAP, which may have recognition and measurement requirements that differ from those in IFRSs (ie the underlying investments might not be measured at fair value, or they might be measured at fair value in accordance with national GAAP, not IFRSs). The boards are reviewing the accounting for investment companies as part of a separate project.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS13_FN0027" type="fn"/></p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p base="F21342649" id="IFRS13_P2491">There are different requirements for measuring the fair value of a financial liability with a demand feature. In US GAAP, Topic 825 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Financial Instruments</ph></ph> and Topic 942 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Financial Services&#x2014;Depository and Lending</ph></ph> describe the fair value measurement of a deposit liability as the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. In IFRSs, IFRS 13 states that the fair value measurement of a financial liability with a demand feature (eg demand deposits) cannot be less than the present value of the amount payable on demand.  That requirement in IFRS 13 was relocated unchanged from IAS 39 and IFRS 9 as a consequence of the IASB&#x2019;s fair value measurement project.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p base="F21342655" id="IFRS13_P2492">There are different disclosure requirements in IFRSs and US GAAP.

The boards will analyse the feasibility of incorporating information about interrelationships between unobservable inputs into a quantitative measurement uncertainty analysis disclosure.

The FASB concluded that some of the disclosures should not be required for non&#x2011;public entities because of the characteristics of the users of the financial statements of those entities. The FASB considered the ability of those users to access information about the financial position of the entity and the relevance to those users of the information that would be provided by the requirements in the disclosure amendments. In contrast, the IASB recently completed a project on the accounting for small and medium&#x2011;sized entities. As a result, the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">IFRS for Small and Medium&#x2011;Sized Entities</ph></ph> addresses the accounting for entities that do not have public accountability, and the disclosures about their fair value measurements.</p></li></ol></li></ol></variant></body></paragraph>
