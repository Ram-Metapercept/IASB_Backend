In addition, the entity must be required (or must have elected, for example, in accordance with the fair value option) to measure the financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis.  The boards concluded that if an entity does not manage its risk exposure on a net basis and does not manage its financial instruments on a fair value basis, the entity should not be permitted to measure the fair value of its financial instruments on the basis of the entity&#x2019;s net risk exposure.</p></body></paragraph>
