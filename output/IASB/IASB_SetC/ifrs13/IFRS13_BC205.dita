Although that proposal was in response to requests from users of financial statements to require additional information about the measurement uncertainty inherent in fair value measurements (particularly those categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy), the responses from preparers of financial statements indicated that the costs associated with preparing such a disclosure would outweigh the benefits to users                     once the information had been aggregated by class of asset or liability.              As an alternative to the proposal, those respondents suggested that the boards should require a qualitative assessment of the subjectivity of fair value measurements categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, as well as an alternative quantitative approach that would be less costly to prepare (see paragraphs BC188&#x2013;BC195).</p></body></paragraph>
