Consequently, IASC decided that the discount rate should reflect the time value of money, but should not attempt to capture those risks. Furthermore, the discount rate should not reflect the entity&#x2019;s own credit rating, because otherwise an entity with a lower credit rating would recognise a smaller liability. IASC decided that the rate that best achieves these objectives is the yield on high quality corporate bonds. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the yield on government bonds should be used.</p></body></paragraph>
