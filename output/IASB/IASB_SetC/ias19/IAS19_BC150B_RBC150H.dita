The       Interpretations Committee observed that the wording in paragraph 93 of IAS 19 appeared to       suggest that all employee contributions that are linked to service should be attributed to       periods of service as a reduction of service cost (ie as a negative benefit). However,       employee contributions that are linked solely to the employee&#x2019;s service rendered in the       same period in which those contributions are payable (for example, contributions that are a       fixed percentage of salary throughout the period of the employment) might also be considered       to be a reduction of the cost of short-term employee benefits (ie a reduction in salary).       Consequently, the Interpretations Committee recommended to the IASB that it should amend       IAS 19 regarding the accounting for such contributions.</p></variants></body></paragraph>
