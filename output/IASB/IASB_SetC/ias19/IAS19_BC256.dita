In contrast, FASB ASC Topic 420 regards some involuntary termination benefits as being provided in exchange for employees&#x2019; future services (or, expressed another way, a &#x2018;stay bonus&#x2019;). In such cases under US GAAP, an entity recognises the cost of those benefits over the period of the employees&#x2019; service, consistently with the accounting for other employee benefits.</p></body></paragraph>
