According to IAS 19 before its revision in 1998, the discount rate that was assumed in determining the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits reflected the long&#x2011;term rates, or an approximation thereto, at which such obligations were expected to be settled. IASC rejected the use of such a rate because it was not relevant for an entity that does not contemplate settlement and it was an artificial construct, because there may be no market for settlement of such obligations.</p></body></paragraph>
