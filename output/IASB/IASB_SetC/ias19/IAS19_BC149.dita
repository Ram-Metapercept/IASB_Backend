These respondents believe that projecting the funding position would involve a significant amount of additional work and that in most regions it would be very difficult to establish a suitable adjustment to the liabilities to reflect the effect of conditional indexation based on the funding position. In the Board&#x2019;s view, an entity should estimate the likely conditional indexation of benefits based on the current funding status of the plan, consistently with how financial assumptions are determined in accordance with <xref id="IAS19_X0981" base="F16229971" href="IAS19_80.dita#IAS19_80">paragraph 80</xref>. Paragraph 80 requires financial assumptions to be based on market expectations at the end of the reporting period for the period over which the obligations are to be settled.</p></body></paragraph>
