However, a comprehensive project to address all areas of post&#x2011;employment benefit accounting could take many years to complete. Nevertheless, the Board recognised a short&#x2011;term need to provide users of financial statements with better information about post&#x2011;employment benefit promises.</p></body></paragraph>
