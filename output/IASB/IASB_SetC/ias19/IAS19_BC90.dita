The Board acknowledged that the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph><xref keyref="footnotes/IAS19_FN0034" type="fn"/> and <xref base="F75161319" href="../ias01/IAS01_TOC.dita#IAS01_TOC0001" id="IAS19_X0940">IAS 1</xref> do not describe a principle that would identify the items an entity should recognise in other comprehensive income rather than in profit or loss.
