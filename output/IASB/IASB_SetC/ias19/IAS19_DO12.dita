He agrees with the respondents&#x2019; concerns summarised in <xref id="IAS19_X1159" base="F16231232" href="IAS19_BC82.dita#IAS19_BC82">paragraph BC82</xref> that plan assets may be made up of many different types of investments, and that &#x2018;the return on high quality corporate bonds would be arbitrary and would not be a faithful representation of the return that investors require or expect from each type of asset.&#x2019; Therefore, in his view, it does not provide more useful information to use the rate used to discount the defined benefit obligation in place of the previous requirement to use expected return on plan assets.</p></body></paragraph>
