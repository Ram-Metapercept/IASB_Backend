Under FRS 5, the balance sheet presents both the gross amount of the asset and, as a direct deduction, the related non&#x2011;recourse debt. Supporters of this approach argued that it portrays the close link between related assets and liabilities without compromising general offsetting requirements. Opponents of the linked presentation argued that it creates a form of balance sheet presentation that IASC had not previously used and might cause confusion. IASC decided not to adopt the linked presentation.</p></body></paragraph>
