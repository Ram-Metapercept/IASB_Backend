The majority of the respondents supported those proposals. Some respondents questioned whether retrospective application was practicable because some calculations might require information that is not readily available. The IASB observed that in current practice, contributions from employees or third parties are generally reduced from service cost without being attributed to periods of service. The proposed amendments are intended to provide relief so that entities can deduct contributions from service cost in the period in which the service is rendered, which was common practice prior to the 2011 amendments to IAS 19. The impact of retrospective application would therefore be minimal in those cases. Consequently, the IASB decided to retain the requirement for retrospective application.</p></body></paragraph>
