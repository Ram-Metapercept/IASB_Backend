To distinguish the remeasurement component from service cost and net interest in an informative way, the 2010 ED proposed that entities should recognise the remeasurements component as an item of other comprehensive income, thus removing the previous option to recognise in profit or loss all changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset). The Board noted that although changes included in the remeasurements component may provide more information about the uncertainty and risk of future cash flows, they provide less information about the likely amount and timing of those cash flows.</p></body></paragraph>
