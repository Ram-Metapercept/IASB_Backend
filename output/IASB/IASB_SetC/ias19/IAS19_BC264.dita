The objective of these requirements was to ensure that any gain or loss on curtailment is recognised at the same time as an expense resulting from a related termination benefit, from a restructuring provision or from both. In IAS 19 before the amendments made in 2011 and <xref base="F16231132" href="../ias37/IAS37_TOC.dita#IAS37_TOC0001" id="IAS19_X1125">IAS 37</xref>, the recognition criteria for termination benefits and restructuring provisions were very similar and would have resulted in related termination benefits and restructuring being recognised together because both required recognition when an entity was demonstrably committed to the transaction.</p></body></paragraph>
