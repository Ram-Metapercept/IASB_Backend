For a high risk investment, this has the effect of recognising the anticipated higher return in profit or loss, and the effect of higher risk in other comprehensive income. In contrast, the net interest approach recognises in other comprehensive income both the higher return and the effects of higher risk.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
