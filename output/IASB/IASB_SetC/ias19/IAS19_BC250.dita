Thus the Board aligned this disclosure with the general requirement for defined benefit plans, which requires an entity to disclose the expected contribution for a defined benefit plan for the next annual period. The Board confirmed the proposal in the ED for a narrative description of any funding arrangement and funding policy. That requirement is consistent with the requirement for single employer defined benefit plans.</p></body></paragraph>
