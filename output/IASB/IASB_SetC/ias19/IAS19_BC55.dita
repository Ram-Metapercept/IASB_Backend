For example, consider an entity that provides a benefit of CU100<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS19_FN0032" type="fn"/> to employees who remain in service for two years. At the end of the first year, the employee and the entity are not in the same position as at the beginning of the first year, because the employee will need to work for only one more year, instead of two, before becoming entitled to the benefit. Although there is a possibility that the benefit may not vest, that difference is an obligation and, in IASC&#x2019;s view, should result in the recognition of a liability at the end of the first year. The measurement of that obligation at its present value reflects the entity&#x2019;s best estimate of the probability that the benefit may not vest.</p></body></paragraph>
