The return on high quality corporate bonds would be arbitrary and would not be a faithful representation of the return that investors require or expect from each type of asset. However, in the Board&#x2019;s view, using the same rate as the rate used to discount the liability is a practical approach that:</p> <ol id="IAS19_L0132" base="F16151108" type="lower-roman"><li><li_value>(i)</li_value> <p id="IAS19_P1163" base="F16151109">would not require an entity to make a subjective judgement on how to divide the return on plan assets into an interest component and a remeasurement.</p></li><li><li_value>(ii)</li_value> <p id="IAS19_P1164" base="F16151121">results in amounts recognised in profit or loss that reflect the effect of the time value of money on both the defined benefit obligation and on plan assets. Consequently, the amounts recognised in profit or loss reflect the differences between funded and unfunded plans.</p></li></ol></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IAS19_P1165" base="F16151123">the requirements in <xref id="IAS19_X0934" base="F16229707" href="IAS19_g83-86.dita#IAS19_g83-86/IAS19_g83-86_TI">paragraph 83</xref> for determining the discount rate can result in economically similar defined benefit obligations being reported at different amounts, depending on whether there is a deep market in high quality corporate bonds. As noted in <xref id="IAS19_X0935" base="F16229708" href="IAS19_BC13.dita#IAS19_BC13">paragraph BC13</xref>, the Board considered improving the discount rate requirements of IAS 19, but decided to defer consideration of the discount rate until it decides whether to review measurement of the defined benefit obligation as a whole.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
