Similarly, some defined benefit plans provide benefits that are conditional to some extent on whether there are sufficient assets in the plan to fund them. Such features share risk between the entity and the plan participants and affect the ultimate cost of the benefits. Hence, the 2010 ED proposed to clarify that the present value of the defined benefit obligation should reflect the best estimate of the effect of risk&#x2011;sharing and conditional indexation features. Many respondents agreed with that proposal.</p></body></paragraph>
