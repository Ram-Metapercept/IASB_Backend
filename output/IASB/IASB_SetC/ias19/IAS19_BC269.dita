Thus entities may recognise previously unrecognised actuarial gains and losses and past service cost by adjusting equity, instead of by allocating part of those adjustments against the carrying amount of assets such as inventories. In the Board&#x2019;s view, such an allocation could have been costly and would have provided little or no benefit to users.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p base="F16152534" id="IAS19_P1686">In financial statements for periods beginning before 1 January 2014, an entity need not provide comparatives for the disclosures about the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation. The Board provided this exemption to provide sufficient lead time for entities to implement the necessary systems.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
