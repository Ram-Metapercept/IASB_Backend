But many respondents disagreed with the proposal to recognise the effects of settlements in other comprehensive income, for the following reasons:</p><ol id="IAS19_L0172" base="F16151837" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IAS19_P1452" base="F16151838">There is overlap between the definitions of settlements, curtailments and plan amendments and the transactions usually happen at the same time, so it can be difficult to allocate the gains and losses between them. Requiring different accounting treatments for settlements, curtailments and plan amendments would introduce practical difficulties, diversity in practice and structuring opportunities.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IAS19_P1453" base="F16151840">Settlements with third parties typically involve additional cost (such as a profit margin for the third party) and the effect of management&#x2019;s decision to incur this additional cost should be reflected in profit or loss when that transaction occurs.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IAS19_P1454" base="F16151842">Recognising a gain or loss on derecognition of a liability in other comprehensive income seems inconsistent with other IFRSs that require a gain or loss on derecognition of a liability to be recognised in profit or loss.</p></li><li><li_value>(d)</li_value> <p id="IAS19_P1455" base="F16151844">If settlements are the result of an event accounted for separately in profit or loss, then the gain or loss on settlement should be recognised in the same place as that event.</p></li><li><li_value>(e)</li_value> <p id="IAS19_P1456" base="F16151860">A settlement can be interpreted as an &#x2018;action&#x2019; of the plan sponsor, so the argument that past service cost should be recognised in profit or loss &#x2018;because [the plan amendment] occurs [when] an entity takes an action that reduces the benefits provided by the plan to employees&#x2019; (Basis for Conclusions on 2010 ED, paragraph BC48) is applicable for the treatment of settlements as well.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
