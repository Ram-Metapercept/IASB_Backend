Mr Yamada does not agree with that reasoning because, in his view, the actual return on plan assets provides information about the performance of plan assets during the period, but the disaggregation of the actual return into interest income and a remeasurements component does not provide information about the likely timing and amount of future cash flows. Therefore, in his view, it does not represent faithfully the performance of plan assets if the actual returns on plan assets in excess of the interest income on plan assets are presented in other comprehensive income and not presented in profit or loss when they occur. Instead, all the components should be presented in profit or loss when they occur. Therefore, he does not agree with <xref id="IAS19_X1164" base="F16231238" href="IAS19_120.dita#IAS19_120">paragraph 120(c)</xref>. In his view the amount representing remeasurements does not have a clearly defined characteristic that justifies its presentation in other comprehensive income.</p></body></paragraph>
