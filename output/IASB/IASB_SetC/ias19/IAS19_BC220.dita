However, the Board agreed with the views of respondents to the 2010 ED that when plan amendments, curtailments and settlements occur together, requiring entities to distinguish them for disclosure would be excessive. Therefore, the amendments do not require an entity to distinguish them when they occur together.</p></body></paragraph>
