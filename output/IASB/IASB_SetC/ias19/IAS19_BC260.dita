However, there was no requirement in that version of IAS 19 to communicate the plan of termination to employees. The Board added a requirement specifying that an entity does not have a present obligation to provide termination benefits until it has communicated its plan of termination to each of the affected employees. The Board also replaced the criteria in IAS 19 relating to the plan of termination with those in Topic 420. Although those criteria were very similar, the Board concluded that it would be better if they were identical.</p></body></paragraph>
