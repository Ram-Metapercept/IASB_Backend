The Board also concluded that it would be better to treat group plans separately from multi&#x2011;employer plans because of the difference in information available to the participants: in a group plan, information about the plan as a whole should generally be available. The Board further noted that, if the parent wishes to comply with IFRSs in its separate financial statements or wishes its subsidiaries to comply with IFRSs in their individual financial statements, then it must obtain and provide the necessary information at least for the purposes of disclosure.</p></body></paragraph>
