The Board agreed with respondents that entities should focus on the principle of the disclosure: to disaggregate plan assets into classes that distinguish the risk and liquidity characteristics of those assets. In support of that principle, the amendments provide a list of example categories that would allow entities to adapt their disclosures to the nature and risks of the assets in their plans.</p></body></paragraph>
