However, some respondents said that the determination of an appropriate disaggregation method was intrinsically linked to the accounting model and should not be considered until there is a fundamental review of IAS 19. The Board considered the components of defined benefit cost in the context of the accounting model of IAS 19. In the Board&#x2019;s view, the disaggregation requirements are consistent with that model and provide useful information.</p></body></paragraph>
