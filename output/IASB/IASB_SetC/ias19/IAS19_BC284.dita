Those costs will depend on the complexity of an entity&#x2019;s defined benefit arrangements and the options in IAS 19 that the entity currently elects to apply. However, those costs should be minimal because in order to apply the previous version of IAS 19 entities need to obtain much of the information that the amendments require. Consequently, the Board believes that the benefits of the amendments outweigh the costs.</p></body></paragraph>
