However, the Board concluded that such a requirement would result in generic disclosure that would not provide enough specific information to be useful to users of financial statements. Nonetheless, in the Board&#x2019;s view, information about an entity&#x2019;s use of asset&#x2011;liability matching strategies, or about the use of techniques such as annuities or longevity swaps to manage longevity risk, would provide additional information on how the entity manages the risk inherent in its defined benefit plan. Accordingly, the 2010 ED proposed a requirement to disclose information about these items.</p></body></paragraph>
