The IASB noted that the plan assets and the defined         benefit obligation would increase by the amount of the contributions paid. This is because the         contributions that are paid increase the employer&#x2019;s obligation to the employees even if         those contributions are attributed to other periods of service to reflect the net cost to the         employer.</p></variants></body></paragraph>
