They would also conflict with the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph>&#x2019;s assumption that the entity is a going concern and with its definition of a liability. IAS 19 does not require the recognition of an additional minimum liability. Some of the circumstances discussed in the preceding two paragraphs might have given rise to contingent liabilities requiring disclosure under IAS 37 .</p></body></paragraph>
