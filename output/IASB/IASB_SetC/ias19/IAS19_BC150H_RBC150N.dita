In some circumstances, age-based contributions could approximate contributions that depend on the number of years of service, because both of the contribution formulas depend on time. However, age-based contributions are independent of the number of years of service. For example, the terms of a plan require employee contributions of four per cent of salary for the first ten years and then six per cent thereafter. The increase to six per cent is not only related to the service in the current year, but is also related to the first ten years of service, which is a prerequisite for the change in the contribution percentage. If the terms of the plan required employee contributions of four per cent of salary if the employee was 30 years old or younger and six per cent if the employee was more than 30 years old, then an employee would be required to contribute either four per cent or six per cent regardless of the length of their service. In other words, the contributions paid for each year are not dependent on prior service.</p></body></paragraph>
