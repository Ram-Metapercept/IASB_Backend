Before those amendments, IAS 19 required that costs of administering the plan, other than those included in the actuarial assumptions used to measure the defined benefit obligation, should be deducted from the return on plan assets. But IAS 19 did not specify which costs should be included in those actuarial assumptions.</p></body></paragraph>
