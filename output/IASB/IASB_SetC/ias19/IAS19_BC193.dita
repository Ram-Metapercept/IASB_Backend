IASC believed that the use of market&#x2011;related values would add excessive and unnecessary complexity and that the combination of the &#x2018;corridor&#x2019; approach to actuarial gains and losses with deferred recognition outside the &#x2018;corridor&#x2019; was sufficient to deal with concerns about volatility.<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS19_FN0051" type="fn"/></p></body></paragraph>
