However, in the Board&#x2019;s view it would not be practical to limit the disclosure to risks that are specific or unusual without providing a clear definition of those terms. Instead, the amendments in 2011 require an entity to focus the disclosure on risks that the entity judges to be significant or unusual.</p></body></paragraph>
