Furthermore, where any such apparent correlation does exist, it is not clear whether the correlation results from shared characteristics of the portfolio and the obligations or from changes in the contractual pension promise.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IAS19_P1318" base="F16151584">the return on equity securities does not correlate with other risks associated with defined benefit plans, such as variability in mortality, timing of retirement, disability and adverse selection.</p></li><li><li_value>(d)</li_value> <p id="IAS19_P1319" base="F16151586">in order to evaluate a liability with uncertain cash flows, an entity would normally use a discount rate lower than the risk&#x2011;free rate, but the expected return on an appropriate portfolio is higher than the risk&#x2011;free rate.</p></li><li><li_value>(e)</li_value> <p id="IAS19_P1320" base="F16151588">the assertion that final salary is strongly correlated with asset returns implies that final salary will tend to decrease if asset prices fall, yet experience shows that salaries tend not to decline.</p></li><li><li_value>(f)</li_value> <p id="IAS19_P1321" base="F16151590">the notion that equities are not risky in the long term, and the associated notion of long&#x2011;term value, are based on the fallacious view that the market always bounces back after a crash. Shareholders do not get credit in the market for any additional long&#x2011;term value if they sell their shares today. Even if some correlation exists over long periods, benefits must be paid as they become due. An entity that funds its obligations with equity securities runs the risk that equity prices may be down when benefits must be paid. In addition, the hypothesis that the real return on equities is uncorrelated with inflation does not mean that equities offer a risk&#x2011;free return, even in the long term.</p></li><li><li_value>(g)</li_value> <p id="IAS19_P1322" base="F16151592">the expected long&#x2011;term rate of return on an appropriate portfolio cannot be determined sufficiently objectively in practice to provide an adequate basis for an accounting standard. The practical difficulties include specifying the characteristics of the appropriate portfolio, selecting the time horizon for estimating returns on the portfolio and estimating those returns.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
