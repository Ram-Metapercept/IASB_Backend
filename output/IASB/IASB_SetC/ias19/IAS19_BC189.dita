Accordingly, IASC extended the definition of plan assets to include some insurance policies (described in IAS 19 as qualifying insurance policies) that satisfy the same conditions as other plan assets. These decisions were implemented in amendments to IAS 19 approved by IASC in October 2000.</p></body></paragraph>
