This approach would maintain continuity of measurement throughout the life of the benefit, but the Board rejected it because measuring the benefit at the undiscounted amount could result in an amount that differs from its present value if the entity no longer expects to settle the benefit before twelve months after the end of the annual reporting period.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
