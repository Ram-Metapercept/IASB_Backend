The issue arose because some think that the basket of high quality corporate bonds should be determined at a country level, and not at a currency level, because paragraph 83 of IAS 19 states that in countries in which there is no deep market in such bonds, the market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds shall be used.</p></body></paragraph>
