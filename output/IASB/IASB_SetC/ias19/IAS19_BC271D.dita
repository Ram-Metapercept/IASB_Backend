The Board concluded that the benefits of applying the amendments retrospectively were unlikely to exceed the cost of doing so because retrospective application:</p><ol id="IAS19_L0210" base="F69404403" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IAS19_P1699" base="SL69404418">might result in significant cost for some entities that choose to present, as a separate component of equity, the cumulative amount of remeasurements recognised in other comprehensive income. As explained in <xref id="IAS19_X1140" base="F74060898" href="IAS19_BC173C.dita#IAS19_BC173C">paragraphs BC173C&#x2013;BC173D</xref>, the amendments could change whether and when an entity remeasures the net defined benefit liability (asset) in accordance with <xref id="IAS19_X1141" base="F74060899" href="IAS19_99.dita#IAS19_99/IAS19_99_V2">paragraph 99</xref>. Accordingly, such entities might have had to revisit plan amendments, curtailments and settlements that occurred several years previously and remeasure the net defined benefit liability (asset) as of those dates.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IAS19_P1700" base="SL69404419">would not provide useful trend information to users of financial statements because plan amendments, curtailments and settlements are discrete one-off events.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IAS19_P1701" base="SL69404420">would affect only amounts recognised in profit or loss or in other comprehensive income for prior periods presented&#x2014;it would affect neither total comprehensive income nor the amounts recognised in the statement of financial position for those periods.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
