To do so eliminates from profit or loss the effects of differences between the actual return on plan assets and the rate applied to the defined benefit obligation. In his view the elimination of these differences introduces a type of smoothing mechanism. Thus, in his view the proposal is not an improvement on the previous version of IAS 19.</p></body></paragraph>
