Some requested that the sensitivity analysis should be limited to the assumptions that have a significant effect on the financial statements, such as the discount rate. The Board agreed with these respondents that in many cases the discount rate would be one of the most significant assumptions. However, depending on the plan and other facts and circumstances, other assumptions might be significant. The 2010 ED proposed that the sensitivity analysis should apply only to &#x2018;significant actuarial assumptions&#x2019;. Consequently, the Board confirmed that proposal.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p base="F16152386" id="IAS19_P1619">Some respondents raised a concern that a &#x2018;reasonably possible&#x2019; change is open to subjectivity and suggested that IAS 19 should specify a quantitative range. However, although setting the range to a particular percentage might improve comparability, the Board was concerned that a quantitative range might not reflect the reasonably possible ranges in different circumstances. The Board noted that requiring sensitivity on the basis of changes in the relevant actuarial assumption that were &#x2018;reasonably possible&#x2019; at that date is consistent with the sensitivity disclosure requirements of other standards, such as <xref base="F16231038" href="../ifrs07/IFRS07_TOC.dita#IFRS07_TOC0001" id="IAS19_X1103">IFRS 7</xref> .</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
