However, in the Board&#x2019;s view, such a change would be an exemption from the general requirements of IAS 34 and consequently it decided against such an amendment. The Board is not aware of concerns with the application of these interim reporting requirements for entities that applied the immediate recognition option under the previous version of IAS 19.</p></body></paragraph>
