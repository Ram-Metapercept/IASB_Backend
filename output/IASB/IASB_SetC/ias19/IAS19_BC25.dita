However, IASC concluded in 1998 that an obligation arises as an employee renders service that increases the employee&#x2019;s entitlement (conditional or unconditional) to future paid absences; for example, accumulating paid sick leave creates an obligation because any unused entitlement increases the employee&#x2019;s entitlement to sick leave in future periods. The probability that the employee will be sick in those future periods affects the measurement of that obligation, but does not determine whether that obligation exists.</p></body></paragraph>
