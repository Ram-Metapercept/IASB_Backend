Topic 712 requires an entity to recognise these special termination benefits when the employees accept the employer&#x2019;s offer of termination benefits. The amendments made to IAS 19 in 2011 are consistent with those requirements. Topic 712 also specifies the accounting for a class of termination benefits known as &#x2018;contractual termination benefits&#x2019;. Topic 712 requires an entity to recognise contractual termination benefits when it is probable that employees will be entitled to benefits and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The amendments made in 2011 do not converge with those requirements; instead, IAS 19 requires those benefits to be recognised when an entity can no longer withdraw an offer of those benefits.</p></body></paragraph>
