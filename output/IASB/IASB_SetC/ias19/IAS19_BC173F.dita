Plan amendments, curtailments or settlements generally result from management decisions and thus differ from significant market fluctuations, which occur independently of management decisions. The Board decided that the accounting for &#x2018;significant market fluctuations&#x2019; is outside the scope of these amendments. Consequently, the amendments address only the measurement of current service cost and net interest for the period after a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement.</p></body></paragraph>
