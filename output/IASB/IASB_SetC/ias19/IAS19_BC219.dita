Some respondents to the 2010 ED stated that this separation would be arbitrary because of the interrelationships between some actuarial assumptions, particularly between financial assumptions. For example, discount rates may be correlated with inflation rates. However, the Board observed that, in general, financial assumptions are less intertwined with demographic assumptions than with other financial assumptions. Thus, the Board concluded that it would not be unduly difficult to distinguish the effects of changes in financial assumptions from the effects of changes in demographic assumptions.</p></body></paragraph>
