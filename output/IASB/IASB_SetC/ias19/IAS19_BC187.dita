Some argue that this element of discretion weakens the link between the benefits and the reimbursement so much that a net presentation is not justifiable. They believe that the definition of plan assets should exclude assets held by such funds and that a gross approach should be used in such cases. IASC concluded that the link between the benefits and the reimbursement was strong enough in such cases that a net approach was still appropriate.</p></body></paragraph>
