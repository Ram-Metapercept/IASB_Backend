In the circumstances in (a) this would be when the employee accepts the offer and in the circumstances in (b) this would be when the entity communicates a termination plan to the affected employees. The Board concluded that until these events occur the employer has discretion to avoid paying termination benefits and, therefore, a liability does not exist.</p></body></paragraph>
