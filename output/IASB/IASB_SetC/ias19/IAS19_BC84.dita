These contrasting views may reflect how different respondents consider the net defined benefit liability (asset) recognised in the statement of financial position as either comprising two components (the plan assets and the defined benefit obligation), which are measured separately but presented together (the gross view), or representing a single amount owed to, or from, the plan (the net view). These differences in views may also reflect differences in plan design, such as the degree of an entity&#x2019;s control over the plan assets. The expected return approach is more consistent with the gross view and the net interest approach is more consistent with the net view. The Board concluded that the net view is more consistent with the presentation of the net defined benefit liability (asset) in the statement of financial position, and therefore the disaggregation of the defined benefit cost in the statement of comprehensive income should also be based on the net view.</p></body></paragraph>
