The payment of benefits that are set out in the terms of the plan, including terms that provide members with options on the nature of benefit payment such as an option to take a lump sum instead of an annuity, would be included in the actuarial assumptions. Therefore, any difference between an estimated benefit payment and the actual benefit payment is an actuarial gain or loss.</p></body></paragraph>
