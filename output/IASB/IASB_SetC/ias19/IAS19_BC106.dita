Some respondents to the 2010 ED asked the Board to clarify whether remeasurements recognised in other comprehensive income result in income or expense that is eligible for inclusion in the cost of an asset. Some respondents said that recognising remeasurements as part of an asset and then recognising that asset as an expense in profit or loss would be inconsistent with the Board&#x2019;s conclusion that reclassification from other comprehensive income to profit or loss should be prohibited.</p></body></paragraph>
