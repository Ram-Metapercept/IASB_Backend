If the Board confirms this proposal as part of its future discussion, then the references to the timing of recognition for restructuring costs will become redundant and the timing of recognition for plan amendments and curtailments will be aligned only with the timing of recognition for termination benefits. The Board will review the timing of recognition for restructuring costs when it finalises the amendments to <xref base="F16231134" href="../ias37/IAS37_TOC.dita#IAS37_TOC0001" id="IAS19_X1127">IAS 37</xref> resulting from the 2005 ED.</p></body></paragraph>
