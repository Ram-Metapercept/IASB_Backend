The Board did not align the measurement requirements of IAS 19 for termination benefits with those of Topic 420. When an entity provides termination benefits through a post&#x2011;employment defined benefit plan (for example, by enhancing retirement benefits) the Board concluded that it would be unduly complex to specify that an entity should measure the benefits at fair value. To do so would require the effect of the changes to the plan arising from the termination of employment to be isolated, on a continuous basis, from the remainder of the plan.</p></body></paragraph>
