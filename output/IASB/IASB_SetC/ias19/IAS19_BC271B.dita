In the IASB&#x2019;s view, the objective of the amendments published in 2013 is to provide relief in the accounting for contributions from employees or third parties and, therefore, the effective date should be set as early as possible, while allowing jurisdictions to have sufficient time to prepare for the new requirements. Consequently, the IASB decided that the effective date of the amendments should be 1 July 2014, with earlier application permitted.</p></body></paragraph>
