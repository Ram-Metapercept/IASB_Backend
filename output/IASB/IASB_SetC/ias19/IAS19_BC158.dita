If a plan amendment or curtailment occurs in isolation (ie it is not triggered by a settlement, termination benefit or restructuring), determining when the plan amendment occurs requires the exercise of judgement. The timing of recognition would depend on the individual facts and circumstances and how they interact with the constructive obligation requirements in <xref id="IAS19_X1012" base="F16230033" href="IAS19_g61-62.dita#IAS19_g61-62/IAS19_g61-62_TI">paragraphs 61 and 62</xref>. The Board concluded that providing further guidance on when a plan amendment &#x2018;occurs&#x2019; is beyond the scope of the amendments made in 2011.</p></body></paragraph>
