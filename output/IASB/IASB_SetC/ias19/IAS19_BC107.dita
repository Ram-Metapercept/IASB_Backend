In the Board&#x2019;s view, whether an item is included in the cost of an asset depends on its nature and whether it meets the definition of cost in the relevant IFRS for that asset. Furthermore, in the Board&#x2019;s view this would be consistent with its conclusions on the reclassification of amounts recognised in other comprehensive income because amounts recognised as part of an asset would not be recognised in other comprehensive income first. Accordingly, the Board added no further guidance on this matter.</p></body></paragraph>
