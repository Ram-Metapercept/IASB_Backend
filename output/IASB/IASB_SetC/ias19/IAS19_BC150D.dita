The Board noted that the IFRS Interpretations Committee (the &#x2018;Interpretations Committee&#x2019;) had already discussed a potential broader amendment relating to the discount rate and, after several meetings, recommended that the determination of the discount rate for post-employment benefit obligations should be addressed in the Board&#x2019;s research project on discount rates.</p></body></paragraph>
