The         IASB observed that examples illustrating the proposed practical expedient in ED/2013/4 implied         two criteria&#x2014;one is whether contributions are a fixed percentage of salary and the         other is whether the contributions are independent of the number of years of service.</p>     </variants></body></paragraph>
