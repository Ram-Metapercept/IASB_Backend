The economic cost of that financing is interest cost, calculated using the rate specified in <xref id="IAS19_X0931" base="F16229704" href="IAS19_g83-86.dita#IAS19_g83-86/IAS19_g83-86_TI">paragraph 83</xref>. Similarly, a net defined benefit asset is an amount owed by the plan or by the employees to the entity. The entity accounts for the present value of economic benefits that it expects to receive from the plan or from the employees in the form of reductions in future contributions or as refunds. The entity discounts those economic benefits using the rate specified in <xref id="IAS19_X0932" base="F16229705" href="IAS19_g83-86.dita#IAS19_g83-86/IAS19_g83-86_TI">paragraph 83</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
