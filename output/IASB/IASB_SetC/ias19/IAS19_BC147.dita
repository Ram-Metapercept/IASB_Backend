In general, according to <xref id="IAS19_X0979" base="F16452602" href="IAS19_88.dita#IAS19_88">paragraph 88</xref>, the measurement of the benefit obligation must reflect the best estimate of any future effect of such conditional indexation. However, some respondents noted that the strict separation of the measurement of plan assets and liabilities under IAS 19 results in a mismatch: the conditional indexation is included in the present value of the defined benefit obligation, but not in the measurement of the plan assets. Some argue that the effect of conditional indexation should not be included in the measurement of the liability until the underlying returns are included in the measurement of the plan assets.</p></body></paragraph>
