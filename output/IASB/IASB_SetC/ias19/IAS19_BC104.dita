If the minimum liability exceeded the obligation measured on the normal projected salary basis (with deferred recognition of some types of income and expense), the excess was recognised as an intangible asset (not exceeding the amount of any unamortised past service cost, with any further excess deducted directly from equity) and as an additional minimum liability.</p></body></paragraph>
