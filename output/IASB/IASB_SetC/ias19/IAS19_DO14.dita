In the previous version of IAS 19, actuarial gains and losses on plan assets were defined as experience adjustments, ie the effects of differences between the previous actuarial assumptions (the expected return on assets) and what actually occurred. However, <xref id="IAS19_X1161" base="F16231235" href="IAS19_BC86.dita#IAS19_BC86">paragraph BC86</xref> explains the nature of the remeasurements component as being a residual after determining the service cost and net interest components, and simply restates the definition of remeasurements in <xref id="IAS19_X1162" base="F16231236" href="IAS19_7.dita#IAS19_7">paragraph 7</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
