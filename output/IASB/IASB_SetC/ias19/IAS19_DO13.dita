He agrees that determining the &#x2018;expected return on plan assets&#x2019; that is used by the previous version of IAS 19 requires judgement by management, but this does not mean that the &#x2018;expected return on plan assets&#x2019; is unreliable. In his view, estimating the &#x2018;expected return on plan assets&#x2019; requires the same degree of judgement as do other accounting estimates.</p></body></paragraph>
