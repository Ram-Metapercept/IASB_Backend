If no increase was assumed, this was an implicit assumption that no change will occur and it would be misleading to assume no change if an entity did expect a change. IAS 19 maintains the requirement in IAS 19 before its revision in 1998 that measurement should take account of estimated future salary increases. IASC also believed that increases in future medical costs can be estimated with sufficient reliability to justify incorporation of those estimated increases in the measurement of the obligation.</p></body></paragraph>
