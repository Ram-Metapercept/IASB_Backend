This is because there may be uncertainty in the terms of the plan about how surpluses will be used or deficits funded across the consolidated group. However, the Board concluded that entities within a group should always be able to make at least a consistent and <i>reasonable</i> allocation, for example on the basis of a percentage of pensionable pay.</p></body></paragraph>
