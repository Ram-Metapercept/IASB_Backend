In the Board&#x2019;s view, benefits that are economically the same should be measured similarly regardless of how the benefit formula describes them. Consequently, the 2010 ED proposed that expected future salary increases should be included in determining whether a benefit formula expressed in terms of current salary allocates a materially higher level of benefit in later years.</p></body></paragraph>
