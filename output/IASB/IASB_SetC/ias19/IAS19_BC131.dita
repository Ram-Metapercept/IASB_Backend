Some expressed the view that the most appropriate risk&#x2011;adjusted rate is given by the expected return on an appropriate portfolio of plan assets that would, over the long term, provide an effective hedge against such an obligation. An appropriate portfolio might include: </p><ol id="IAS19_L0152" base="F16151528" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IAS19_P1305" base="F16151529">fixed interest securities for obligations to former employees to the extent that the obligations are not linked, in form or in substance, to inflation;</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IAS19_P1306" base="F16151531">index&#x2011;linked securities for index&#x2011;linked obligations to former employees; and</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IAS19_P1307" base="F16151543">equity securities for benefit obligations towards current employees that are linked to final pay. This is based on the view that the long&#x2011;term performance of equity securities is correlated with general salary progression in the economy as a whole and hence with the final&#x2011;pay element of a benefit obligation.</p></li></ol><p id="IAS19_P1308" base="F16151544">It is important to note that the portfolio actually held need not necessarily be an appropriate portfolio in this sense. Indeed, in some countries, regulatory constraints may prevent plans from holding an appropriate portfolio. For example, in some countries, plans are required to hold a specified proportion of their assets in the form of fixed interest securities. Furthermore, if an appropriate portfolio is a valid reference point, it is equally valid for both funded and unfunded plans.</p></body></paragraph>
