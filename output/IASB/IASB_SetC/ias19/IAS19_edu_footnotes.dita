In the fact pattern described in the request, an entity sponsors a           post- employment benefit plan that is administered by a third party. The relevant terms           and conditions of the plan are as follows:</p>         <ol><li><li_value>a.</li_value><p>the entity has an obligation to pay fixed annual               contributions to the plan. The entity has determined that it will have no legal or               constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the plan does not hold               sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits relating to employee service in the               current and prior periods.</p></li><li><li_value>b.</li_value><p>the entity is entitled to a potential discount on its annual               contributions. The discount arises if the ratio of plan assets to plan liabilities               exceeds a set level. Thus, any discount might be affected by actuarial assumptions and               the return on plan assets.</p></li></ol>         <p>The request asked whether, applying IAS 19, the existence of a right to a potential           discount would result in a defined benefit plan classification.</p>         <p>Paragraph 8 of IAS 19 defines defined contribution plans as &#x2018;post-employment benefit           plans under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity (a fund) and           will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund           does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits relating to employee service           in the current and prior periods&#x2019;. Defined benefit plans are &#x2018;post-employment benefit           plans other than defined contribution plans&#x2019;.</p>         <p>Paragraphs 27&#x2013;30 of IAS 19 specify requirements relating to the classification of           post-employment benefit plans as either defined contribution plans or defined benefit           plans.</p>         <p>Paragraph 27 states that &#x2018;[p]ost-employment benefit plans are classified as either           defined contribution or defined benefit plans, depending on the economic substance of the           plan as derived from its principal terms and conditions&#x2019;. The Committee therefore noted           the importance of assessing all relevant terms and conditions of a post-employment benefit           plan, as well as any informal practices that might give rise to a constructive obligation,           in classifying the plan. That assessment would identify whether:</p>         <ol><li><li_value>a.</li_value><p>the entity&#x2019;s legal or constructive obligation towards               employees is limited to the amount that it agrees to contribute to the fund (a defined               contribution plan as described in paragraph 28); or</p></li><li><li_value>b.</li_value><p>the entity has an obligation to provide the agreed benefits               to current and former employees (a defined benefit plan as described in paragraph               30).</p></li></ol>         <p>The Committee noted that, in the fact pattern described in the request, assessing the           relevant terms and conditions of the plan would include, for example, assessing (a) the           manner and frequency in which annual contributions and any potential discount (including           the target ratio) are determined; and (b) whether the manner and frequency of determining           the contributions and any discount transfers actuarial risk and investment risk (as           described in IAS 19) to the entity.</p>         <p>The Committee observed that, to meet the definition of a defined contribution plan, an           entity must (a) have an obligation towards employees to pay fixed contributions into a           fund; and (b) not be obliged to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold           sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits relating to employee service in the current           or prior periods. For example, there should be no possibility that future contributions           could be set to cover shortfalls in funding employee benefits relating to employee service           in the current and prior periods.</p>         <p>The Committee also observed that paragraphs 28 and 30 of IAS 19 specify that, under           defined contribution plans, actuarial risk and investment risk fall in substance on the           employee whereas, under defined benefit plans, those risks fall in substance on the           entity. Paragraphs 28 and 30 describe (a) actuarial risk as the risk that benefits will           cost the entity more than expected or will be less than expected for the employee; and (b)           investment risk as the risk that assets invested will be insufficient to meet expected           benefits. Paragraph BC29 of IAS 19 explains that the definition of defined contribution           plans does not exclude the upside potential that the cost to the entity may be less than           expected.</p>         <p>Consequently, the Committee concluded that, applying IAS 19, the existence of a right to           a potential discount would not in itself result in classifying a post-employment benefit           plan as a defined benefit plan. Nonetheless, the Committee reiterated the importance of           assessing all relevant terms and conditions of a plan, as well as any informal practices           that might give rise to a constructive obligation, in classifying the plan. </p>         <p>The Committee noted that, applying paragraph 122 of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 1</ph>             <ph outputclass="standard_title">Presentation of Financial Statements</ph></ph>, an           entity would disclose the judgements that its management has made regarding the           classification of post-employment benefit plans, if those are part of the judgements that           had the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.</p>         <p>The Committee concluded that the requirements in IAS 19 provide an adequate basis for an           entity to determine the classification of a post-employment benefit plan as a defined           contribution plan or a defined benefit plan. Consequently, the Committee decided not to           add the matter to its standard-setting agenda.]</p>       </fn>       <fn base="IAS19_51" id="IAS19_FN0010">         <p outputclass="keep_with_next" id="IAS19_P1781">[IFRIC® <i>Update</i>, July 2011, Agenda           Decision, &#x2018;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS               19</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Employee Benefits</ph></ph>&#x2014;defined           contribution plans with vesting conditions&#x2019;</p>         <p>The Interpretations Committee received a request seeking clarification on the effect that           vesting conditions have on the accounting for defined contribution plans. The Committee           was asked whether contributions to such plans should be recognised as an expense in the           period for which they are paid or over the vesting period. In the examples given in the           submission, the employee&#x2019;s failure to meet a vesting condition could result in the refund           of contributions to, or reductions in future contributions by, the employer.</p>         <p>The Committee noted from the definition of a defined contribution plan in paragraph 8 of           IAS 19 and the explanation in paragraph BC5 of IAS 19 that vesting conditions do not           affect the classification of a plan as a defined contribution plan if the employer is not           required to make additional contributions to cover shortfalls because of these vesting           conditions. In addition, the Committee noted from the guidance in paragraph 50 of IAS 19           that accounting for defined contribution plans is based on accounting for the reporting           entity&#x2019;s obligation to pay contributions to the separate entity that runs the plan, but           not accounting for the obligation to the employees who benefit from the plan. As such, the           Committee noted that accounting for defined contribution plans under IAS 19 focuses on the           employer&#x2019;s obligation to make a contribution to the separate entity that runs the plan.           Consequently, paragraph 51 of IAS 19 requires, and paragraph IN5 of IAS 19 explains, that           each contribution to a defined contribution plan is to be recognised as an expense or           recognised as a liability (accrued expense) over the period of service that obliges the           employer to pay this contribution to the defined contribution plan. This period of service           is distinguished from the period of service that entitles an employee to receive the           benefit from the defined contribution plan (ie the vesting period), although both periods           may be coincident in some circumstances. Refunds are recognised as an asset and as income           when the entity/employer becomes entitled to the refunds, eg when the employee fails to           meet the vesting condition.</p>         <p>The Committee noted that there is no significant diversity in practice in respect of the           effect that vesting conditions have on the accounting for defined contribution           post&#x2011;employment benefit plans, nor does it expect significant diversity in practice to           emerge in the future. Consequently, the Committee decided not to add this issue to its           agenda.]</p>       </fn><fn base="IAS19_55" id="IAS19_FN0011">         <p outputclass="keep_with_next" id="IAS19_P1782">[IFRIC® <i>Update</i>, April 2002, Agenda           Decision, &#x2018;Employee benefits&#x2014;Undiscounted vested employee benefits&#x2019;</p>         <p>The IFRIC considered the possibility of issuing guidance on whether vested benefits           payable when an employee left service could be recognised at an undiscounted amount (ie           the amount that would be payable if all employees left the entity at the balance sheet           date). The IFRIC agreed that it would not issue an interpretation on this matter because           the answer is clear under IAS 19: the measurement of the liability for the vested benefits           must reflect the expected date of employees leaving service and be discounted to a present           value.]</p>       </fn><fn base="IAS19_70" id="IAS19_FN0013">         <p outputclass="keep_with_next" id="IAS19_P1784">[IFRIC® <i>Update</i>, September 2007,           Agenda Decision, &#x2018;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS               19</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Employee Benefits</ph></ph>&#x2014;Post&#x2011;employment           benefits&#x2014;Benefit allocation for defined benefit plans&#x2019;</p>         <p>IAS 19 requires entities to attribute the benefit in defined benefit plans to periods of           service in accordance with the benefit formula, unless the benefit formula would result in           a materially higher level of benefit allocated to future years. In that case, the entity           allocates the benefit on a straight&#x2011;line basis (paragraph 67 of IAS 19). The IFRIC had           previously considered whether entities should take into account expected increases in           salary in determining whether a benefit formula expressed in terms of current salary           allocates a materially higher level of benefit in later years.</p>         <p>The IFRIC considered this issue as part of its deliberations leading to Draft IFRIC           Interpretation D9 <i>Employee Benefits with a Promised Return on Contributions or Notional             Contributions</i>.

Consequently, the Interpretations Committee observed that the concept of high quality           should not change over time. Accordingly, a reduction in the number of HQCB should not           result in a change to the concept of high quality. The Interpretations Committee does not           expect that an entity&#x2019;s methods and techniques used for determining the discount rate so           as to reflect the yields on HQCB will change significantly from period to period.           Paragraphs 83 and 86 of IAS 19, respectively, contain requirements if the market in HQCB           is no longer deep or if the market remains deep overall, but there is an insufficient           number of HQCB beyond a certain maturity.</p>         <p outputclass="keep_with_next">The Interpretations Committee also noted that:</p>         <ol type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>a.</li_value>             <p id="IAS19_P1808">paragraphs 144 and 145 of IAS 19 (2011) require an entity to               disclose the significant actuarial assumptions used to determine the present value of               the defined benefit obligation and a sensitivity analysis for each significant               actuarial assumption;</p>           </li><li><li_value>b.</li_value>             <p id="IAS19_P1809">the discount rate is typically a significant actuarial assumption;               and</p>           </li><li><li_value>c.</li_value>             <p id="IAS19_P1810">an entity shall disclose the judgements that management has made in               the process of applying the entity's accounting policies and that have the most               significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements in accordance               with paragraph 122 of IAS 1 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Presentation of Financial Statements</ph></ph>;               typically the identification of the HQCB population used as a basis to determine the               discount rate requires the use of judgement, which may often have a significant effect               on the entity&#x2019;s financial statements.</p>           </li></ol>         <p id="IAS19_P1811">The Interpretations Committee discussed this issue in several meetings           and noted that issuing additional guidance on, or changing the requirements for, the           determination of the discount rate would be too broad for it to address in an efficient           manner.

The Interpretations Committee considers that an entity should take into account           the guidance in paragraphs 84 and 85 of IAS 19 (2011) in determining what corporate bonds           can be considered to be HQCB. Paragraphs 84 and 85 of IAS 19 (2011) state that the           discount rate:</p>         <ol type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>a.</li_value>             <p>reflects the time value of money but not the actuarial or investment risk;</p>           </li><li><li_value>b.</li_value>             <p>does not reflect the entity-specific credit risk;</p>           </li><li><li_value>c.</li_value>             <p>does not reflect the risk that future experience may differ from actuarial               assumptions; and</p>           </li><li><li_value>d.</li_value>             <p>reflects the currency and the estimated timing of benefit payments.</p>           </li></ol>         <p>The Interpretations Committee further noted that &#x2018;high quality&#x2019; as used in paragraph 83           of IAS 19 reflects an absolute concept of credit quality and not a concept of credit           quality that is relative to a given population of corporate bonds, which would be the           case, for example, if the paragraph used the term &#x2018;the highest quality&#x2019;. Consequently, the           Interpretations Committee observed that the concept of high quality should not change over           time. Accordingly, a reduction in the number of HQCB should not result in a change to the           concept of high quality. The Interpretations Committee does not expect that an entity&#x2019;s           methods and techniques used for determining the discount rate so as to reflect the yields           on HQCB will change significantly from period to period. Paragraphs 83 and 86 of IAS 19,           respectively, contain requirements if the market in HQCB is no longer deep or if the           market remains deep overall, but there is an insufficient number of HQCB beyond a certain           maturity.</p>         <p outputclass="keep_with_next">The Interpretations Committee also noted that:</p>         <ol type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>a.</li_value>             <p>paragraphs 144 and 145 of IAS 19 (2011) require an entity to disclose the significant               actuarial assumptions used to determine the present value of the defined benefit               obligation and a sensitivity analysis for each significant actuarial assumption;</p>           </li><li><li_value>b.</li_value>             <p>the discount rate is typically a significant actuarial assumption; and</p>           </li><li><li_value>c.</li_value>             <p>an entity shall disclose the judgements that management has made in the process of               applying the entity's accounting policies and that have the most significant               effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements in accordance with               paragraph 122 of IAS 1 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Presentation of Financial Statements</ph></ph>; typically the identification of               the HQCB population used as a basis to determine the discount rate requires the use of               judgement, which may often have a significant effect on the entity&#x2019;s financial               statements.</p>           </li></ol>         <p>The Interpretations Committee discussed this issue in several meetings and noted that           issuing additional guidance on, or changing the requirements for, the determination of the           discount rate would be too broad for it to address in an efficient manner.

The submitter asked whether the entity can use market           yields on bonds denominated in US dollars issued by the Ecuadorian government, or whether           instead the entity is required to use market yields on bonds denominated in US dollars           issued by a government in another market or country.</p>         <p outputclass="keep_with_next">The Committee observed, applying paragraph 83 of IAS 19,           that:</p>         <ol type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>a.</li_value>             <p id="IAS19_P1838">an entity with post-employment benefit obligations denominated in a               particular currency assesses the depth of the market in high quality corporate bonds               denominated in that currency.

An underlying concern in           the submission was whether the revisions to IAS 19 in 2011 that, for example, clarified           the treatment of risk-sharing features related to defined benefit obligations, affect the           accounting for contribution-based promises.</p>         <p>The Interpretations Committee noted that the 2011 amendments to IAS 19 clarified the           treatment of risk-sharing features (described in paragraph BC144 as features that share           the benefit of a surplus or the cost of a deficit between the employer and the plan           participants or benefit plans that provide benefits that are conditional to some extent on           whether there are sufficient assets in the plan to fund them). The Interpretations           Committee noted that the IASB did not intend to address elements specific to           contribution-based promises in the amendments. Accordingly, the Interpretations Committee           does not expect the 2011 amendments to cause changes to the accounting for           contribution-based promises unless such promises also include elements of risk sharing           arrangements between employees and employers. Finally, the Interpretations Committee noted           that the IASB expressed, in paragraph BC148 of the revised Standard, that addressing           concerns about the measurement of contribution-based promises and similar promises was           beyond the scope of the 2011 amendments.</p>         <p>On the basis of the analysis described above, the Interpretations Committee decided not           to add the issue to its agenda. It is, however, working towards proposals to address the           accounting for contribution-based promises.

ATZ plans are early           retirement programmes designed to create an incentive for employees within a certain age           group to smooth the transition from (full- or part-time) employment into retirement before           the employees&#x2019; legal retirement age. ATZ plans offer bonus payments to employees in           exchange for a 50 per cent reduction in working hours. Their employment is terminated at           the end of a required service period. The bonus payments are wholly conditional on the           completion of the required service period. If employment ends before the required service           is provided, the employees do not receive the bonus payments. ATZ plans typically operate           over a period of one to six years. Eligibility for the benefit would be on the basis of           the employee&#x2019;s age but would also typically include a past service requirement.</p>         <p outputclass="keep_with_next">IAS 19 (2011) was the result of revisions issued in 2011 to           IAS 19. These revisions, among other things, amended the guidance relating to termination           benefits. Paragraph 8 of IAS 19 (2011) defines termination benefits as &#x2018;employee benefits           provided in exchange for the termination of an employee&#x2019;s employment as a result of           either:</p>         <ol type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>             <p>an entity&#x2019;s decision to terminate an employee&#x2019;s employment before the normal               retirement date; or</p>           </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>             <p>an employee&#x2019;s decision to accept an offer of benefits in exchange for the termination               of employment.&#x2019;</p>           </li></ol>         <p outputclass="keep_with_next">The Committee observed that ATZ plans have attributes of           both required service and termination benefits. The Committee noted that the distinction           between benefits provided in exchange for services and termination benefits should be           based on:</p>         <ol type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>             <p>all the relevant facts and circumstances for each individual entity&#x2019;s offer of               benefits under the plan considered;</p>           </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>             <p>the indicators provided in paragraph 162 of IAS 19 (2011); and</p>           </li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value>             <p>the definitions of the different categories of employee benefits in IAS 19               (2011).</p>           </li></ol>         <p outputclass="keep_with_next">The Committee noted that, in the fact pattern described           above, consistently with paragraph 162(a) of IAS 19 (2011), the fact that the bonus           payments are wholly conditional upon completion of an employee service over a period           indicates that the benefits are in exchange for that service. They therefore do not meet           the definition of termination benefits.</p>         <p>On the basis of the analysis described above, the Committee decided not to add the issue           to its agenda.] </p>       </fn></bodydiv></body></topic>
