The Board concluded that extending that exemption would be contrary to its general approach of limiting exceptions. In the Board&#x2019;s view such an exemption would not be appropriate for all multi&#x2011;employer plans, such as when an entity becomes a dominant participant in a multi&#x2011;employer plan, perhaps because other participants leave the plan.</p></body></paragraph>
