An entity applies paragraph 99 when the effect of a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement on past service cost, or a gain or loss on a settlement, is material. In accordance with <xref base="F74060826" href="../ias08/IAS08_TOC.dita#IAS08_TOC0001" id="IAS19_X1019"><ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 8</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors</ph></ph></xref>, an entity need not apply the requirements in paragraph 99 when the effect of applying those requirements is immaterial. The amendments require an entity to use updated assumptions to determine current service cost and net interest for the period after a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement. Accordingly, when an entity assesses whether remeasuring its net defined benefit liability (asset) in accordance with paragraph 99 has a material effect, the entity considers not only the effect on past service cost, or a gain or loss on settlement, but also the effects of using updated assumptions for determining current service cost and net interest for the remainder of the annual reporting period after the plan amendment, curtailment or settlement.</p></body></paragraph>
