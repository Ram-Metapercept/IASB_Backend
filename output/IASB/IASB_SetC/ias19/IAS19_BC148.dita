The Board also considered other changes to the measurement approach, such as using option pricing techniques to capture the effect of the conditional indexation in a manner consistent with the fair value of the plan assets. However, the Board rejected those alternatives because they would require changing the fundamental measurement of the defined benefit obligation. The Board noted that concerns regarding measurement of benefits with conditional indexation are similar to concerns regarding the measurement of contribution&#x2011;based promises discussed in its 2008 discussion paper. Addressing these concerns was beyond the scope of the amendments made in 2011.</p></body></paragraph>
