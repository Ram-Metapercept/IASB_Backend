In principle, the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) should apply to separate or individual financial statements in the same way as they apply to any other financial statements. Following that principle would mean amending IAS 19 to allow group entities that participate in a plan that meets the definition of a multi&#x2011;employer plan, except that the participants are under common control, to be treated as participants in a multi&#x2011;employer plan in their separate or individual financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
