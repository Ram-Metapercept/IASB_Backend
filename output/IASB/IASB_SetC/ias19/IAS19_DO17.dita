This would mean that the expected return on plan assets is recognised in profit or loss and the difference between the expected return on plan assets and the actual return on plan assets is recognised in other comprehensive income. As stated in <xref id="IAS19_X1165" base="F16231290" href="IAS19_DO15.dita#IAS19_DO15">paragraph DO15</xref>, in Mr Yamada&#x2019;s view, this difference gives better information than the revised remeasurement component.</p></body></paragraph>
