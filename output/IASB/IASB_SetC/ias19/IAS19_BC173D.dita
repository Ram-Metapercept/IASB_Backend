The Board decided that this is appropriate because in situations in which the application of paragraph 99 would have a material effect on financial statements, the amendments would result in providing more relevant information for users of financial statements, in keeping with the objective of the amendments (see <xref id="IAS19_X1021" base="F74060857" href="IAS19_BC173B.dita#IAS19_BC173B">paragraph BC173B</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
