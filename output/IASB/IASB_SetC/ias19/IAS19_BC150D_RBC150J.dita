In ED/2013/4 the IASB proposed that some contributions         from employees or third parties may be excluded from being attributed to periods of service as         a negative benefit. Instead, those contributions could be recognised as a reduction in the         service cost in the period in which they are payable if, and only if, they are linked solely         to the employee&#x2019;s service rendered in that period. An example of such a situation would         be contributions based on an employee&#x2019;s salary at a fixed percentage that does not         depend on the number of years of service by the employee to the employer. On the other hand,         if an employee is required to contribute a higher percentage of salary in later years of         service, then the contributions are not linked solely to the employee&#x2019;s service that is         rendered in the period in which the contributions are payable.</p></variants></body></paragraph>
