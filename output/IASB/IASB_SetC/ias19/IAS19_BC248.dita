The Board did not agree with that view. The amount required to withdraw from a plan faithfully represents the obligation, whether that amount is determined on the same basis as for another plan or on a different basis. If the amounts are determined on the basis of different underlying requirements, the actual amounts required to withdraw will differ.</p></body></paragraph>
