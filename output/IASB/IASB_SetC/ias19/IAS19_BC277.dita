Topic 420 requires an entity to recognise a &#x2018;stay bonus&#x2019; over the period of the employees&#x2019; service and to recognise other termination benefits when the entity has a plan of termination that meets specified criteria. The amendments made in 2011 distinguish benefits provided in exchange for service and benefits provided in exchange for the termination of employment. A &#x2018;stay bonus&#x2019; would not be classified as a termination benefit under IAS 19 because it is provided in exchange for service and, therefore, would be attributed to periods of service in accordance with <xref id="IAS19_X1145" base="F16231140" href="IAS19_70.dita#IAS19_70">paragraph 70</xref> of IAS 19.</p></body></paragraph>
