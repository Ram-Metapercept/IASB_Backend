However, because the amendments made in 2011 require immediate recognition of unvested past service costs, there is no longer any reason for the distinction between past service cost and the second part of the definition of curtailments. Accordingly, the Board removed the second part of that definition. Consequently, past service cost will include amounts attributed to past service resulting from any plan amendment and would be recognised immediately.</p></body></paragraph>
