Respondents to the discussion paper expressed the view that the disclosures in IAS 19 were insufficient to inform users about the potential effect on the amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows associated with an entity&#x2019;s participation in multi&#x2011;employer defined benefit plans. Accordingly, the 2010 ED proposed additional disclosures about participation in a multi&#x2011;employer plan and respondents generally welcomed those proposals.</p></body></paragraph>
