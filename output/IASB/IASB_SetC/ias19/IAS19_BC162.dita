This distinguishes the closure of a plan to a significant number of employees (which is closer to a plan amendment) and an increase in estimated employee turnover (which is closer to a change in actuarial assumption). Thus, if a reduction in the number of employees is judged significant, then an entity accounts for it in the same way as for a plan amendment, and if not significant an entity will have to determine whether it is a change in actuarial assumption or a plan amendment. Because IAS 19 now treats plan amendments and curtailments in the same way, it now treats gains or losses on a curtailment as one form of past service cost.</p></body></paragraph>
