Therefore, recognising unvested past service cost immediately is consistent with the recognition of unvested current service cost that IAS 19 treats as an obligation in <xref base="F16230029" href="IAS19_72.dita#IAS19_72" id="IAS19_X1008">paragraph 72</xref>. The Board noted that recognising unvested past service cost immediately would not be consistent with <xref base="F16230030" href="../ifrs02/IFRS02_TOC.dita#IFRS02_TOC0001" id="IAS19_X1009">IFRS 2</xref>. However, in the Board&#x2019;s view, internal consistency within IAS 19 is more desirable than consistency with <xref base="F16230031" href="../ifrs02/IFRS02_TOC.dita#IFRS02_TOC0001" id="IAS19_X1010">IFRS 2</xref>.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p base="F16151779" id="IAS19_P1432">The Board acknowledged that recognising unvested past service cost immediately may introduce an opportunity for accounting arbitrage by selection of the benefit formula, but recognising unvested past service cost over the vesting period may also be open to accounting arbitrage. If an entity recognised unvested past service cost over the vesting period, an entity could change how much of the total expense is recognised by changing the amount subject to vesting conditions and the vesting period. Any approach to attributing unvested benefits to periods of service is arbitrary. However, recognising unvested past service cost immediately is more consistent with <xref base="F16230032" href="IAS19_72.dita#IAS19_72" id="IAS19_X1011">paragraph 72</xref> and the recognition of unvested current service cost.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
