In addition, it is often difficult to attribute subsequent expenditure directly to a particular intangible asset rather than to the business as a whole. Therefore, only rarely will subsequent expenditure&#x2014;expenditure incurred after the initial recognition of a purchased intangible asset or after completion of an internally generated intangible asset&#x2014;be recognised in the carrying amount of an asset.<xref keyref="footnotes/SIC32_FN0004" type="fn"/></u></p></body></paragraph>
