In SIC&#x2011;32, that document replaced a reference in paragraph 5 to the <i>Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements</i> adopted by the Board in 2001 (<i>Framework</i>) with a reference to the 2018 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph>. The Board does not expect that replacement to have a significant effect on the application of the Interpretation. Paragraph 5 describes the accounting for expenditure excluded from the scope of the Interpretation. That paragraph also states that this type of expenditure&#x2014;expenditure on an Internet service provider hosting the entity&#x2019;s web site&#x2014;is recognised as an expense, so the amendment will not affect the accounting treatment.</p></body></paragraph>
