If the entity will continue to operate in the future, it treats the costs of doing so as future costs. For these future costs, <xref href="../ias37/IAS37_18.dita" id="IFRIC06_X0026">paragraph 18 of IAS 37</xref> emphasises that &#x2018;Financial statements deal with the financial position of an entity at the end of its reporting period and not its possible position in the future. Therefore, no provision is recognised for costs that need to be incurred to operate in the future.&#x2019;</p></body></paragraph>
