Allocating waste management costs on the basis of market share would then be a matter of measurement rather than recognition. Supporters of this argument emphasise the definition of a constructive obligation in <xref id="IFRIC06_X0027" base="F15826775" href="../ias37/IAS37_g10-13.dita#IAS37_g10-13/IAS37_g10-13_TI">paragraph 10 of IAS 37</xref> and point out that in determining whether past actions of an entity give rise to an obligation it is necessary to consider whether a change in practice is a realistic alternative. These respondents believed that when it would be necessary for an entity to take some unrealistic action in order to avoid the obligation then a constructive obligation exists and should be accounted for.</p></body></paragraph>
