Consistent with its conclusions in IFRSs 4 and 6, the IASB decided to permit changes in accounting policies for regulatory deferral account balances if they make the financial statements more relevant and no less reliable, or more reliable and no less relevant, judged in accordance with the criteria in IAS 8.</p></body></paragraph>
