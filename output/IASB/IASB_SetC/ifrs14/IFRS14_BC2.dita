Some national accounting standard-setting bodies permit or require such balances to be recognised as assets and liabilities under some circumstances, depending on the type of rate regulation in force. In such cases, these regulatory deferral account balances are often referred to as &#x2018;regulatory assets&#x2019; and &#x2018;regulatory liabilities&#x2019;. However, as explained in this Basis for Conclusions (see <xref id="IFRS14_X0318" base="F33215856" href="IFRS14_BC11.dita#IFRS14_BC11">paragraphs BC11&#x2013;BC12</xref> and <xref id="IFRS14_X0319" base="F33215857" href="IFRS14_BC21.dita#IFRS14_BC21">BC21</xref>), the term &#x2018;regulatory deferral account balances&#x2019; has been chosen as a neutral descriptor for these items for the purpose of this Standard.</p></body></paragraph>
