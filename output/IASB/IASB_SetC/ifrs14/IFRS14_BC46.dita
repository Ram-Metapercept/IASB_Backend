The IASB noted that a first-time adopter of IFRS may apply the deemed cost exemption in paragraph D8B of IFRS 1, which allows adopters to use their previous GAAP carrying amounts at the date of transition to IFRS. This exemption provides relief for first-time adopters that would otherwise be required to separate out the regulatory component of the carrying amount of sometimes very large and old items of property, plant and equipment or intangible assets at the date of transition to IFRS, which may be impracticable. The IASB has made a consequential amendment to the scope of the IFRS 1 exemption to make it consistent with the scope of this Standard. Consequently, entities that apply this Standard will only need to isolate the regulatory deferral account amounts for those items on a prospective basis from the date of transition to IFRS. The IASB also noted that the information required for separate presentation on an ongoing basis is normally available in any case, due to the information requirements of rate regulators.</p></body></paragraph>
