This has led to an industry-specific &#x2018;carve-out&#x2019; from the application of IFRS in at least one jurisdiction that has otherwise adopted IFRS, to allow rate-regulated entities to continue to use local GAAP (or, in some cases, US GAAP). In addition, there are examples of &#x2018;carve-ins&#x2019; being created that introduce specific guidance for rate-regulated activities that overlies IFRS requirements as issued by the IASB. However, the interaction of such guidance when it is in conflict with the requirements of IFRS can create diversity of application in practice.</p></body></paragraph>
