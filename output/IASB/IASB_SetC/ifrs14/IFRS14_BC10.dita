In addition, the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting</ph></ph> (the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">&#x2018;Conceptual Framework&#x2019;</ph></ph>)<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS14_FN0008" type="fn"/> is currently being reviewed and updated. The outcome of the Rate-regulated Activities project will be influenced by the outcome of the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> project. The initial objective is to develop a Discussion Paper for each of these projects, which the IASB hopes will provide a basis for developing guidance in the long term. It also decided, in December 2012, to develop an interim Standard on the accounting for regulatory deferral accounts that would apply until the completion of the comprehensive project. This Standard is the result of that decision.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
