The rates charged for goods or services in the current period may be intended to recover a combination of past costs, current costs and, in some cases, anticipated future costs. Although the rate regulator may specify the period over which the recovery of the regulatory deferral account balances is intended, judgement may be needed to identify the costs that the revenue billed in a period recovers. This means that detailed scheduling of the timing of recovery or reversal of each regulatory deferral account debit or credit balance may be needed for the purpose of identifying which amounts should be classed as current or for determining which amounts would be recovered or reversed in the same period for the purposes of offsetting. Consequently, the IASB has decided that regulatory deferral account balances should not be presented as current or non-current and that debit and credit balances should not be offset in the statement of financial position. Instead, this Standard requires information about the period(s) over which regulatory deferral account balances are expected to be recovered or reversed to be disclosed. An entity is not, however, prohibited from identifying current and non-current amounts within the information disclosed if the relevant information is available.</p></body></paragraph>
