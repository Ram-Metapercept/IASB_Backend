In 1982, the US national standard-setter, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS 71 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation</ph></ph>.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS14_FN0003" type="fn"/> SFAS 71 formalised many of those principles. In the absence of specific national guidance, practice in many other jurisdictions followed SFAS 71. In the financial statements of rate-regulated entities that apply such guidance, regulatory deferral account balances are often incorporated into the carrying amount of items such as property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, or are recognised as separate items in the financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
