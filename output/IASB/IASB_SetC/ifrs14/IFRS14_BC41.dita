Proponents of the first alternative think that regulatory deferral account balances that would be recognised as a result of this Standard do not have the same characteristics as assets and liabilities that would be recognised in accordance with other Standards. Consequently, proponents of this alternative think that all amounts that qualify for recognition as regulatory deferral account balances should be presented separately from the assets and liabilities that are recognised in accordance with other Standards, instead of being included within the carrying amount of the item of property, plant and equipment or other asset.</p></body></paragraph>
