Some users have commented that information related to the impact that rate regulation has on the amount, timing and certainty of returns and cash flows is important. The IASB think that the segregated presentation and related disclosures required by this Standard will highlight more clearly this impact. As noted in <xref id="IFRS14_X0389" base="F33233359" href="IFRS14_BC66.dita#IFRS14_BC66">paragraph BC66</xref>, the requirements should have little or no impact on the net assets or the net profit reported in the financial statements of those entities within the scope of this Standard. Consequently, there is expected to be little disruption to the information available for trend analyses. Although the changes to the presentation of the amounts may cause some initial costs to be incurred, the IASB thinks that the added transparency introduced by this Standard will provide users with clearer and more comparable information.</p></body></paragraph>
