In addition, an understanding of each class of regulatory deferral account is considered important because that can provide information about the nature of the rate regulation and the potential timing of related cash flows. Consequently, this Standard requires the disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information for each type of an entity&#x2019;s rate-regulated activities and each class of regulatory deferral account balance, because this will provide information that is more useful in assessing the impact of different rate-regulatory environments.</p></body></paragraph>
