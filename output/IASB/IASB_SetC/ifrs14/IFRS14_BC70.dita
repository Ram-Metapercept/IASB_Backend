Although many of these entities are understood to use similar policies for the recognition and measurement of these balances, they use different frameworks of accounting for the preparation and presentation of the financial statements as a whole. The IASB thinks that reducing the barriers for these entities to adopt IFRS will improve the comparability of the financial statements of rate-regulated entities across jurisdictions.</p></body></paragraph>
