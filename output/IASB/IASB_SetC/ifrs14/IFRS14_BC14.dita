This is understood to provide a reasonable level of comparability for regulatory deferral account balances across jurisdictions. However, different approaches to accommodating existing practice for such balances have reduced comparability for users of financial statements in these jurisdictions, because the rest of the items in the financial statements are now accounted for using different accounting frameworks (for example, IFRS, US GAAP or local GAAP), depending on which approach has been adopted. In some cases, the development of these carve-in or carve-out options has been in direct response to the publication of the 2009 ED.</p></body></paragraph>
