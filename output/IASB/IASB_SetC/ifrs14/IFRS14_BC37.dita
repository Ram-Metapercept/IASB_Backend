The IASB thinks that, except for IFRS 1, other Standards should not be subject to consequential amendments relating only to this Standard because its application is restricted to a limited population of entities. In addition, it is intended to be applicable only as a short-term interim solution until the comprehensive Rate-regulated Activities project is completed.</p></body></paragraph>
