They suggest that rate regulation creates special conditions that support the recognition of regulatory deferral account balances, even when those balances consist of deferred costs that other Standards require to be recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. The 2009 ED, which proposed that regulatory deferral account balances should be recognised when arising from activities that are subject to a specific type of rate regulation (referred to in the 2009 ED as &#x201C;cost-of-service rate regulation&#x201D;), raised expectations that the IASB had agreed that there was merit to the arguments used to support recognition of such balances as assets and liabilities.</p></body></paragraph>
