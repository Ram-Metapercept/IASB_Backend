However, the IASB observed that the information is often disclosed in various places throughout the financial statements in a way that can make it difficult for a user to appreciate the overall effect that rate regulation has had on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. Consequently, this Standard requires that entities meet the disclosure requirements by providing a table, containing aggregated information, and showing a reconciliation of the movements in the carrying amounts in the statement of financial position of the various categories of regulatory items. This table will be required unless another format is more appropriate. The IASB noted that such a table, presenting information in a structured manner, would assist financial statement users in understanding how the entity&#x2019;s reported financial position and comprehensive income have been affected by rate regulation.</p></body></paragraph>
