Consequently, almost all rate-regulated entities around the world that previously recognised regulatory deferral account balances in their financial statements in accordance with their previous GAAP did not continue to recognise such balances but instead, derecognised them when they first adopted IFRS. In the view of Messrs Edelmann, Gomes and Zhang, to now permit an unknown population of rate-regulated entities to recognise these balances when adopting IFRS will introduce inconsistent accounting treatment into IFRS reporting and will reduce existing comparability.</p></body></paragraph>
