The IASB usually intends to allow a minimum of one year between the date when wholly new Standards or major amendments to Standards are issued and the date when implementation is required. Consequently, the IASB has set 1 January 2016 as the effective date for this Standard. Earlier application is permitted to make the benefits outlined in <xref id="IFRS14_X0363" base="F33229484" href="IFRS14_BC20.dita#IFRS14_BC20">paragraph BC20</xref> available at the earliest opportunity.</p></body></paragraph>
