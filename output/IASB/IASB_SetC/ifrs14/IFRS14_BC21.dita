Consequently, regulatory deferral account balances are not described as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities in this Standard because the IASB has yet to decide whether they meet the definitions of assets or liabilities in the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph>. The separation of these balances from the amounts that are recognised as assets and liabilities in accordance with other Standards is designed to maintain the integrity of the application of existing Standards.</p></body></paragraph>
