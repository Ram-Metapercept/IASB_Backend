The IASB acknowledges that the nature and extent of rate regulation can have a significant impact on the amount and timing of revenue and cash flows of a rate-regulated entity. Hence, the IASB concluded that such disclosures should be part of the financial statements and they could be given either in the financial statements or incorporated by cross-reference from the financial statements to some other statement that is available to users of the financial statements on the same terms as the financial statements and at the same time. This approach is intended to reduce duplication of information and is consistent with some types of risk disclosure required by <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 7</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Financial Instruments: Disclosures</ph></ph>.</p></body></paragraph>
