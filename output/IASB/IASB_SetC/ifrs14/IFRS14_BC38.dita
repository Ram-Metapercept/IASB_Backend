Consequently, a first-time adopter will initially apply this Standard at the same time as it applies IFRS 1. Paragraph D8B of IFRS 1 provides an exemption to allow first-time adopters to use, as the deemed cost at the date of transition to IFRS, the previous GAAP carrying amount of items of property, plant and equipment or intangible assets that are used, or were previously used, in operations subject to rate regulation. For the purposes of that exemption, paragraph D8B defined operations that are subject to rate regulation in the context of a cost-plus or cost-of-service type of rate regulation. The IASB has decided to make a consequential amendment to paragraph D8B of IFRS 1 to make the definition of rate regulation used in that paragraph consistent with the definition used in this Standard. This will ensure that a first-time adopter that applies this Standard is not prohibited from using the exemptions available to other first-time adopters in IFRS 1.</p></body></paragraph>
