Rate regulators may require a regulated entity to maintain its accounts in a form that permits the rate regulator to obtain the information that is needed for regulatory purposes. Rate regulators&#x2019; actions are based on many considerations. This Standard neither limits nor endorses a rate regulator&#x2019;s actions.</p></body></paragraph>
