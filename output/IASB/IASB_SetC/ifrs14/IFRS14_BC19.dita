In order to improve comparability between IFRS preparers that are subject to rate regulation but that do not recognise regulatory deferral account balances and entities that are permitted to recognise such balances in accordance with this Standard, the IASB decided to require segregated presentation of these balances. The IASB thinks that the resulting presentation and disclosure requirements in this Standard will help to minimise the impact of introducing this inconsistency, and that the benefits to users and preparers of financial statements outweigh the costs.</p></body></paragraph>
