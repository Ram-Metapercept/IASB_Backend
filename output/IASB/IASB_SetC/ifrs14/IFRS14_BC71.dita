This will provide greater comparability across those entities within the scope of this Standard. This will, as a result, assist users of financial statements to understand more clearly the impact of recognising regulatory deferral account balances, and will allow direct comparisons not only against those entities that will be permitted to recognise these balances, but also against entities that do not recognise them.</p></body></paragraph>
