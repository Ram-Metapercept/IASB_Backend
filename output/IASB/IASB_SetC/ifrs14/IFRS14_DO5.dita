Many of those members warned against setting a precedent of implementing a policy of adopting an interim solution whenever a major standard-setting project is activated. Messrs Edelmann, Gomes and Zhang are concerned that developing an interim solution in this situation might create uncertainty as to what the IASB&#x2019;s approach might be when major projects are being researched in the future.</p></body></paragraph>
