However, the IASB acknowledges that the separate presentation of regulatory deferral account balances is likely to result in changes to most existing presentation policies. Existing policies of entities within the scope of this Standard usually require or permit certain regulatory deferral account balances to be included within the carrying amount of items of property, plant and equipment and other assets. The separate presentation required by this Standard may add some cost on an ongoing basis, because preparers would need to track some of the differences between the regulatory amounts and those reported in the financial statements in more detail than is currently required.</p></body></paragraph>
