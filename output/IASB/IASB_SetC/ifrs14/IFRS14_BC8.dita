It also considered the comments that had been received on the Interpretations Committee&#x2019;s tentative agenda decisions. Those comments pointed out that although divergence in IFRS practice did not exist, several jurisdictions whose local accounting principles permitted or required the recognition of regulatory deferral account balances would be adopting IFRS in the near future. This would increase pressure for definitive guidance on the recognition of regulatory deferral account balances as assets or liabilities.</p></body></paragraph>
