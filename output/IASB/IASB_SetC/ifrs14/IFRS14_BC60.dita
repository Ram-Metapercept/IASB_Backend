In particular, they requested that it should be made clear that separate line items for regulatory deferral account balances and movements therein should also be included in a condensed set of financial statements. However, the IASB did not agree that additional guidance is necessary. Paragraph 10 of IAS 34 requires that condensed financial statements &#x201C;shall include, at a minimum, each of the headings and subtotals that were included in its most recent annual financial statements and the selected explanatory notes as required by this Standard.&#x201D; In addition, paragraphs 15&#x2013;15A of IAS 34 require that an entity shall include an explanation of events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in the financial position and performance of the entity.</p></body></paragraph>
