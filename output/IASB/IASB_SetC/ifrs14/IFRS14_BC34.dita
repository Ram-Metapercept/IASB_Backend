<paragraph id="IFRS14_BC34" base="F29578146"><paranum>BC34</paranum><prolog><data name="standard_number" value="IFRSÂ 14"/><data name="paranum" value="BC34"/></prolog><body><p id="IFRS14_P1099">As previously noted, the IASB has started the research phase of a comprehensive project to investigate how IFRS financial statements might reflect the effects of rate regulation (see <xref id="IFRS14_X0338" base="F33217430" href="IFRS14_BC10.dita#IFRS14_BC10">paragraph BC10</xref>). Until that project is completed, the IASB wishes to minimise disruption to information used for trend analyses of IFRS financial statements and thus the limitation on changes in accounting policy is intended to be restrictive. The established practice in IFRS has been that almost all rate-regulated entities do not recognise regulatory deferral account balances in IFRS financial statements. Consequently, the IASB thinks that changing an accounting policy to start to recognise such balances, or to recognise a wider range of such balances by modifying a previous GAAP policy, when that changed policy might need to change again following the completion of the Rate-regulated Activities project, would not make the financial statements more reliable. The scope of this Standard and the restriction on changes in accounting policies in paragraphs 13&#x2013;15, therefore, prohibit entities that currently do not recognise regulatory deferral account balances from starting to do so.</p></body></paragraph>
