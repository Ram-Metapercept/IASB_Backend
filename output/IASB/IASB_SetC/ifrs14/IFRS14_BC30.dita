As noted in <xref id="IFRS14_X0331" base="F33215986" href="IFRS14_BC6.dita#IFRS14_BC6">paragraph BC6</xref>, the Interpretations Committee concluded that the recognition criteria in SFAS 71 (now incorporated into Topic 980) were not fully consistent with the recognition criteria in IFRS. This is because some regulatory deferral account balances are specifically prohibited from being recognised as assets and liabilities by other Standards. It is this conflict with the sources listed in paragraph 11 of IAS 8 that has prevented almost all existing IFRS preparers from recognising regulatory deferral account balances. Consequently, the IASB has decided that entities within the scope of this Standard should be granted a temporary exemption from paragraph 11 of IAS 8 in order to overcome the restriction on the use of the sources of accounting guidance referred to in paragraph 12 of IAS 8.</p></body></paragraph>
