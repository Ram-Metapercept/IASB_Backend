This exemption applies to first-time adopters of IFRS that hold items of property, plant and equipment or intangible assets that are, or were previously, used in operations subject to rate regulation. It allows those first-time adopters to use the previous GAAP carrying amount of such an item at the date of transition to IFRS as deemed cost. Consequently, the additional administrative burden of tracking changes need only apply on a prospective basis for differences arising after the date of transition.</p></body></paragraph>
