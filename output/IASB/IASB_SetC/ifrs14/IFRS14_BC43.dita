For the purpose of this Standard, the IASB has decided to require the first alternative. This decision does not change the relief available to first-time adopters using the deemed cost exemption provided by paragraph D8B of IFRS 1 (see <xref id="IFRS14_X0345" base="F33217496" href="IFRS14_BC38.dita#IFRS14_BC38">paragraph BC38</xref>). This is consistent with the IASB&#x2019;s decision not to introduce any changes to the accounting for assets and liabilities that are already addressed in other Standards (see <xref id="IFRS14_X0346" base="F33217497" href="IFRS14_BC26.dita#IFRS14_BC26">paragraph BC26</xref>). Some IASB members think that this separate presentation is essential until the consideration of the more fundamental issues about accounting for rate-regulated activities is completed through the comprehensive project.</p></body></paragraph>
