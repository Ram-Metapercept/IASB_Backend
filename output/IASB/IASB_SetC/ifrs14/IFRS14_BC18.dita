The related presentation and disclosure requirements should help to reduce the disruption to information available for trend analyses for these entities on transition to IFRS, until the IASB can consider these issues in its comprehensive project. This would enable rate-regulated entities to overcome the barrier noted in <xref id="IFRS14_X0322" base="F33215941" href="IFRS14_BC13.dita#IFRS14_BC13">paragraph BC13</xref> and, consequently, to make the transition to IFRS.</p></body></paragraph>
