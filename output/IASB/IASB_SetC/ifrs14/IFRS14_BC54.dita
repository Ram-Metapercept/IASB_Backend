First-time adopters of IFRS can use the deemed cost exemption for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets that is already available in IFRS 1 that allows first-time adopters to use their previous GAAP carrying amounts at the date of transition to IFRS. Consequently, they will only need to change their presentation policies for these items to isolate the regulatory deferral account amounts on a prospective basis from the date of transition to IFRS.</p></body></paragraph>
