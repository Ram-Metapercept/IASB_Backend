In particular, it would enable users to more directly compare the property, plant and equipment or intangible assets of comparable rate-regulated entities (in addition to comparing them to those of non-rate-regulated entities), regardless of whether they recognise regulatory deferral account balances in their financial statements. This would also result in more consistent application of IFRS for all other transactions or activities, irrespective of whether an entity has rate-regulated activities and the type of rate-regulatory environment that the entity is subject to.</p></body></paragraph>
