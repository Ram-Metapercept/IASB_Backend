Consistent with its conclusions in those Standards, the IASB concluded that defining national GAAP would have posed problems. Further definitional problems could have arisen because some entities do not apply the national GAAP of their own country. For example, some non-US entities with rate-regulated activities apply US GAAP (Topic 980). Moreover, it is unusual and, arguably, beyond the IASB's mandate to impose requirements set by another body.</p>     </variant></body></paragraph>
