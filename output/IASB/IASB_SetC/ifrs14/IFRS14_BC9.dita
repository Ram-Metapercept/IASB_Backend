The responses to the 2009 ED raised complex and fundamental issues at a conceptual level. In September 2010, the IASB decided that the complex technical issues could not be resolved quickly, and suspended the project until it had considered whether to include rate-regulated activities in its future agenda. The 2011 Agenda Consultation asked stakeholders to provide their views as to which projects the IASB should give priority.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS14_FN0006" type="fn"/> The responses to this consultation, received through comment letters and other outreach activities, persuaded the IASB to prioritise addressing the unresolved issues related to rate-regulated activities.</p></body></paragraph>
