They believe that further inconsistency might be introduced by entities continuing to apply existing practices that might not be comparable with other entities that have different existing practices. In their view, isolating the impact of recognising regulatory deferral account balances by presenting them separately is not sufficient to eliminate the effect of this inconsistency. Messrs Edelmann, Gomes and Zhang are also concerned that entities might encounter operational difficulties in applying other general Standards to regulatory deferral account balances because there is uncertainty as to whether these balances are assets and liabilities, and there is no single clear and consistent recognition and measurement policy for them. This in turn might create additional diversity and further reduce comparability in practice.</p></body></paragraph>
