In some cases, an entity may incur costs several months or even years before the rate regulator formally approves them. The IASB concluded that, in such cases, judgement is required to determine whether the costs can be considered recoverable. Consequently, the IASB decided not to develop specific recognition or impairment requirements for these circumstances, but instead decided that an entity should continue to apply its previous GAAP accounting policies for the recognition and measurement of such amounts.</p></body></paragraph>
