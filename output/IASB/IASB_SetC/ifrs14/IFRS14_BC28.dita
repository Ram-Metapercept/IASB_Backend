Some IASB members are concerned that entities that will recognise regulatory deferral account balances in accordance with this Standard could give the appearance of being compliant with IFRS while being inconsistent with the stated objectives of the IASB, ie to provide users of financial statements with financial information that is transparent, comparable and of high quality. The IASB did not consider the exemption from parts of IAS 8 lightly, but introduced this interim step to lower a significant barrier to adopting IFRS for some jurisdictions, pending the completion of the comprehensive Rate-regulated Activities project. This step is also intended to minimise disruption, both for users (for example, a lack of continuity of information available for trend analyses) and preparers (for example, extensive system changes) when entities in these jurisdictions make the transition to IFRS.</p></body></paragraph>
