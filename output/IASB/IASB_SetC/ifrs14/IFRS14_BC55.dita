Some respondents to the Exposure Draft <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Regulatory Deferral Accounts</ph></ph>, which was published in April 2013 (the &#x2018;2013 ED&#x2019;), were concerned that this term resulted in the definition being too broad. Those respondents assumed that the intention of including the entity&#x2019;s own governing body was to (appropriately) capture those cases in which an entity conducts previously state-run monopolistic activities and is consequently delegated regulatory powers by the government. However, the respondents were concerned that the scope could be applied, by analogy, to other commercial entities having monopolistic features. This concern was raised within the context of entities that, in the absence of an external regulator, self-regulate (for example, by formally agreeing this with investors through the articles of association or other contractual arrangement). Entities may do this to avoid potential government intervention if they might otherwise be perceived to be abusing their strong market position.<linebreak/></p></body></paragraph>
