However, the Board decided that a practice statement would provide useful guidance for entities, and its flexible application would benefit entities in jurisdictions that have local requirements or regulations. Furthermore, the Board believes that a practice statement might encourage entities that are not accustomed to presenting management commentary to provide it for users. The existence of a practice statement might also encourage jurisdictions to adopt it as their own.</p></body></paragraph>
