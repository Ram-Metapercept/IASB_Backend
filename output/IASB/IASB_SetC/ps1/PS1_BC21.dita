While the Board concluded that preparers should not be required to include a formal confirmation that they have complied with the Practice Statement, because the Statement is not binding, it did agree that it would be helpful if preparers included in management commentary an explanation of the extent to which the Practice Statement has been followed. The Board also concluded that it would be misleading if preparers were to assert compliance with the Practice Statement if they did not comply with the Practice Statement in its entirety.</p></body></paragraph>
