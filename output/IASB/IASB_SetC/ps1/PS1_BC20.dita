The Board observed that providing management commentary without (at minimum) identifying the related financial statements might be misleading for users. Consequently, the Board decided that when an entity presents management commentary that relates to IFRS financial statements, it should either make the financial statements available with the commentary or identify the financial statements to which the commentary relates. The Board noted that because the Practice Statement does not require entities to prepare management commentary, IFRS financial statements can be made available for use without a corresponding management commentary.</p></body></paragraph>
