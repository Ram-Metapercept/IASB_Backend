Financial statements prepared for that purpose meet the common needs of most users. However, financial statements do not provide all the information that users need to make economic decisions because the financial statements largely portray the financial effects of past events and do not provide non&#x2011;financial measures of performance or a discussion of future prospects and plans.</p></body></paragraph>
