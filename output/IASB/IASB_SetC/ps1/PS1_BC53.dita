IFRS 7 permits management to provide required risk disclosures either in the financial statements or in management commentary, if the disclosure in management commentary is cross&#x2011;referenced in the financial statements and management commentary is provided at the same time and under the same terms as the financial statements. However, IFRS 7 and the Practice Statement do not address auditing matters related to the location of those disclosures.</p></body></paragraph>
