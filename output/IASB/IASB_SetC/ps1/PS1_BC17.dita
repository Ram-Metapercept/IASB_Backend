Furthermore, non&#x2011;compliance with the Practice Statement does not prevent the entity&#x2019;s financial statements from complying with IFRSs, if they otherwise do so. Additionally, the entity&#x2019;s financial statements may comply with IFRSs if an entity has not provided management commentary during a particular financial year.</p></body></paragraph>
