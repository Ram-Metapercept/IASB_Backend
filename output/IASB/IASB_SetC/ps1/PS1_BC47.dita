The types of activities that are critical to an entity are specific to that entity. As a consequence, regulators have tended to identify the elements that reflect the type of content that they expect to see in management commentary rather than defining the elements themselves. The Board decided that following a similar approach would generate more meaningful disclosures, because entities can discuss those matters most relevant to their individual circumstances. Some Board members requested that the Practice Statement should include a detailed list of items (eg critical accounting estimates), even though they recognise that the elements and the framework would lead to discussion of those items. However, the Board wishes to avoid a checklist&#x2011;compliance mentality, which might result from specifying a detailed list.</p></body></paragraph>
