However, the Board decided not to include such detailed guidance because there is a risk that undue emphasis could be placed on the application guidance or illustrative examples. Furthermore, the Board observed that such guidance or examples could be misinterpreted and thus reduce the flexibility in applying the framework. Many respondents to the exposure draft supported the Board&#x2019;s decision not to include detailed application guidance or illustrative examples.</p></body></paragraph>
