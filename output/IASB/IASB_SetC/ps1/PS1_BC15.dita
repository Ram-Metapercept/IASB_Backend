It may also be useful for entities that are already accustomed to presenting reports setting out commentary by management because of local requirements or regulations imposed by the public exchanges on which their securities are listed, provided the Practice Statement does not contradict those requirements or regulations. Thus, the Board decided that the Practice Statement could be applied by entities that present management commentary that relates to financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs.</p></body></paragraph>
