As a result, the Board noted that management may need to consider the extent to which commenting on issues relevant to a wider user group may be appropriate given the degree of those issues&#x2019; influence on the performance of the entity and its value. The Board also noted that management commentary should not, however, be seen as a replacement for other forms of reporting addressed to a wider stakeholder group.</p></body></paragraph>
