In this example, management could supplement and complement the disclosure in the financial statements by providing a narrative explanation of the nature of the deficit and the conditions and events that led to the deficit (eg poor returns on plan assets or the demographics of those covered by the plan). Furthermore, management could provide helpful information related to the plan that is not otherwise disclosed in the financial statements, but is important to the management of the plan (eg changing investment managers or focusing on specific investment opportunities).</p></body></paragraph>
