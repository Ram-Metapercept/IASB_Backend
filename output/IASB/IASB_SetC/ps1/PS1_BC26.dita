This is consistent with the objectives stated in regulations and guidance in many jurisdictions. For example, guidance issued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in December 2003 states that the purpose of Management&#x2019;s Discussion and Analysis (MD&amp;A) is &#x2018;not complicated&#x2019;. It is to provide users with information &#x2018;necessary to an understanding of [a company&#x2019;s] financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations&#x2019; (SEC, Regulation S&#x2013;K, Item 303).</p></body></paragraph>
