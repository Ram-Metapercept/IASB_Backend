However, the Board also observed that, before those requirements were amended, the requirements in paragraph 57A could be misread to imply that paragraph 57A applied only in the circumstances described in <xref id="IAS12_X0667" base="F74058531" href="IAS12_52A.dita#IAS12_52A">paragraph 52A</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
