In such cases, an entity       would recognise any difference in profit or loss (see <xref href="IAS12_22.dita">paragraph         22(b) </xref>of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number"><xref href="IAS12_TOC0001.dita">IAS 12</xref></ph></ph>). For example, an entity would       recognise an income tax loss if, on initial recognition, it recognises a deferred tax       liability but is unable to recognise an equal and offsetting deferred tax asset. The Board       concluded that this accounting appropriately reflects the entity&#x2019;s expectation that it will be       unable to benefit fully from the tax deductions available when it settles the liability, but       that it is nonetheless required to make future tax payments as it recovers the asset. As       explained in paragraph <xref href="IAS12_BC85.dita">BC85(a)</xref>, applying the recognition       exemption to the deferred tax liability only because an entity is unable to recognise a       corresponding deferred tax asset would be inconsistent with how the recognition exemption is       applied in other situations.</p></body></paragraph>
