For example, a significant part of the assets of a profitable manufacturing entity is property, plant and equipment and inventories. Property, plant and equipment may be measured using the cost model (paragraph 30 of IAS 16 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Property, Plant and Equipment)</ph></ph> and inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value (paragraph 9 of IAS 2 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Inventories</ph></ph>). If such an entity expects to generate future taxable profit, it may be inconsistent to assume that it will only recover these assets for their carrying amount. This is because a significant part of the manufacturing entity&#x2019;s probable future taxable profit results from using those assets to generate taxable profit in excess of their carrying amount.</p></body></paragraph>
