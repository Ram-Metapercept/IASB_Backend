The Board initially proposed in the exposure draft that the presumption of recovery through sale is not appropriate when the entity has clear evidence that it will consume the asset&#x2019;s economic benefits throughout its economic life. The Board set a criterion that refers to consumption of the asset&#x2019;s economic benefits, rather than to the recovery of the carrying amount, because the Board understands that there is diverse practice regarding the meaning of the recovery of the carrying amount through use or through sale.</p></body></paragraph>
