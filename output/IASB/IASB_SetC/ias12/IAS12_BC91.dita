The amendments apply to any such equal taxable and       deductible temporary differences that arise. In addition, making advance lease payments or       paying initial direct costs could result in additional taxable temporary differences       associated with the lease asset, to which an entity would apply the applicable requirements in         <xref href="IAS12_TOC0001.dita">IAS 12</xref>. In response to requests to do so, the Board       included an example illustrating the accounting for deferred tax on advance lease payments and       initial direct costs.</p></body></paragraph>
