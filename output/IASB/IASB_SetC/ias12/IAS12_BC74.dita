On       initial recognition of the lease asset and lease liability, an entity assesses whether       temporary differences arise in determining whether to recognise deferred tax. In making this       assessment, an entity determines the tax bases of the lease asset and lease liability by       identifying the amounts attributable to them for tax purposes. In some jurisdictions, an       entity may receive tax deductions for lease payments when it makes such payments. In such       situations, the entity determines whether those tax deductions are attributable to:</p><ol type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value><p>the lease asset (and interest expense)&#x2014;because the deductions relate to the expenses arising from the lease (that is, depreciation and interest expense); or</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value><p>the lease liability (and interest expense)&#x2014;because the deductions relate to the repayment of the lease liability and interest expense.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
