However, this amendment allows the change in opening equity of the earliest comparative period presented that arises upon the first application of the amendment to be recognised in opening retained earnings (or in another component of equity, as appropriate), without the need to allocate the change between opening retained earnings and other components of equity. This is to avoid undue cost and effort.</p></body></paragraph>
