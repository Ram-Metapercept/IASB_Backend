As noted in paragraph BC86, an entity would recognise any difference in profit or loss. The Board concluded that the expected benefits of applying the recognition exemption in these situations would not outweigh the costs because: </p><ol type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value><p>applying the recognition exemption in these situations would be complex because the recognition exemption would apply to only a small portion of the resulting deferred tax; and </p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value><p>these situations are expected to arise only in a limited number of jurisdictions and the net effect of applying different tax rates will often be immaterial.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
