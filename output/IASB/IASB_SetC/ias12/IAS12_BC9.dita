In contrast, for investment property that is measured using the cost model in IAS 40, the Board believes that the estimates required for depreciation establish the expected manner of recovery because there is a general presumption that an asset&#x2019;s carrying amount is recovered through use to the extent of the amount subject to depreciation and through sale to the extent of the residual value.</p></body></paragraph>
