In particular, the Board was asked whether the requirements in <xref id="IAS12_X0661" base="F74058483" href="IAS12_57A.dita#IAS12_57A/IAS12_57A_V1">paragraph 57A</xref> (paragraph 52B before the amendments were made) apply only in the circumstances described in <xref id="IAS12_X0662" base="F74058484" href="IAS12_52A.dita#IAS12_52A">paragraph 52A</xref> (for example, when there are different tax rates for distributed and undistributed profits), or whether those requirements apply as long as payments on financial instruments classified as equity are distributions of profit.</p></body></paragraph>
