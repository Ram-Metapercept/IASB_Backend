If temporary differences arise on initial       recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and       affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit, an entity would, in the absence of the       exemption, recognise the resulting deferred tax liability or asset and adjust the carrying       amount of the asset or liability by the same amount. Such adjustments would make the financial       statements less transparent and IAS 12, therefore, prohibits the recognition of deferred tax       in these circumstances.</p></body></paragraph>
