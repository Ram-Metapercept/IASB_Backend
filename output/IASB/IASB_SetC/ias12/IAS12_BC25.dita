The Board observed that <xref id="IAS12_X0638" base="F16220585" href="IAS12_47.dita#IAS12_47">paragraph 47</xref> of IAS 12 requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled on the basis of tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. This requirement applies even when the presumption of recovery through sale is used. For clarification, the Board adjusted the <xref id="IAS12_X0639" base="F16220586" href="IAS12_51C.dita#IAS12_51C/IAS12_TAB0010">illustrative example following paragraph 51C</xref> to reflect the requirement in <xref id="IAS12_X0640" base="F16220587" href="IAS12_47.dita#IAS12_47">paragraph 47</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
