This is because the purpose of the exception is to enable preparers to measure deferred taxes in these circumstances in the least subjective manner and in so doing enhance the comparability                     of financial information about deferred taxes for the benefit of users                     of financial statements. It is also expected to result in an overall reduction of the administrative burden for entities that have previously had to consider the tax consequence of both use and sale of an investment property when measuring deferred taxes.</p></body></paragraph>
