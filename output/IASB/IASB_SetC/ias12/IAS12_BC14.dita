They stated that many items of property, plant and equipment are recovered through use rather than through sale, and that this is consistent with the definition of property, plant and equipment in IAS 16. In addition, many respondents disagreed with the presumption of recovery through sale when the underlying assets are intangible assets for similar reasons. They also warned of unintended consequences that could arise because of the varying nature of intangible assets. Many respondents suggested limiting the scope of the exception to investment properties measured using the fair value model in <xref base="F16220341" href="../ias40/IAS40_TOC0001.dita#IAS40_TOC0001" id="IAS12_X0626">IAS 40</xref>. Having considered those comments, the Board adopted that suggestion. </p></body></paragraph>
