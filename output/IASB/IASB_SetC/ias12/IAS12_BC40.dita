Sometimes, tax law does not explicitly address whether the collection of the principal has tax consequences. Consequently, proponents of this view thought that a difference between the carrying amount of the debt instrument in the statement of financial position and its higher tax base does not give rise to a deductible temporary difference, if this difference results from a loss that they expect will not be realised for tax purposes.</p></body></paragraph>
