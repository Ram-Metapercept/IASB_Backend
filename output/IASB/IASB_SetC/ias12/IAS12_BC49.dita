The carrying amount of an asset does not limit the estimation of probable future taxable profit. In its estimate of probable future taxable profit, an entity includes the probable inflow of taxable economic benefits that results from recovering an asset. This probable inflow of taxable economic benefits may exceed the carrying amount of the asset.</p></body></paragraph>
