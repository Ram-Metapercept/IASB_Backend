This is the case in the example illustrating paragraph 26(d) of IAS 12. Interest is paid at the contractual rate each year, and on maturity of the debt instrument the issuer pays the principal of CU1,000. In this example, if the investor continues to hold the debt instrument, the investor only pays taxes on the interest income. The collection of the principal does not trigger any tax payments.</p></body></paragraph>
