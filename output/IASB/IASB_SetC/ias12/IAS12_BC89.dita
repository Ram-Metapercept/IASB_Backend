The Board decided not to       provide such application guidance because the expected benefits of doing so would not outweigh       the costs. The Board concluded that providing such guidance:</p><ol type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value><p>was unnecessary to achieve the objective of the amendments&#x2014;the amendments will result in entities recognising deferred tax for temporary differences that arise on leases (either on initial recognition or subsequently) regardless of whether tax deductions are attributable to the lease asset or lease liability; and </p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value><p>could cause unintended consequences&#x2014;any such guidance could affect how entities, in other situations, consider the applicable tax laws in determining the tax base of assets and liabilities.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
