In many cases, however, an entity expects to rent out investment property to earn rental income and then sell it to gain from capital appreciation at some point in the future. Without specific plans for disposal of the investment property, it is difficult and subjective to estimate how much of the carrying amount of the investment property will be recovered through cash flows from rental income and how much of it will be recovered through cash flows from selling the asset.</p></body></paragraph>
