It reworded the rebuttable presumption so that clear evidence would no longer be required to rebut the presumption.  The Board also did not pursue the proposed disclosure requirement regarding the fact of, and reason for, the rebuttal.  After those changes, the Board believes that the amendments will not be onerous for entities that have previously been able to establish without difficulty how they expect to recover investment property carried at fair value.</p></body></paragraph>
