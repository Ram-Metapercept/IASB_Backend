The Board decided that it would not be appropriate to limit the estimate of probable future taxable profit to the carrying amount of related assets only for assets to which temporary differences are related, because there is no basis for a different assessment that would depend on whether a deductible temporary difference is related to an asset or not.</p></body></paragraph>
