However, if tax law offsets specific types of losses only against a particular type, or types, of income (for example, if tax law limits the offset of capital losses to capital gains), an entity assesses a deductible temporary difference in combination with other deductible temporary differences of that type(s), but separately from other deductible temporary differences. Segregating deductible temporary differences in accordance with tax law and assessing them on such a basis is necessary to determine whether taxable profits are sufficient to utilise deductible temporary differences. The Board has added paragraph 27A to IAS 12 to clarify this.</p></body></paragraph>
