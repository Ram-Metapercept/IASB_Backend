The Board concluded that:</p><ol type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value><p>applying the recognition exemption to a deferred tax liability only because an entity is unable to recognise a corresponding deferred tax asset applying the recoverability requirement would be inconsistent with how the recognition exemption is applied in other situations.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value><p>removing the capping proposal would significantly reduce the           complexity of applying the amendments while still achieving their objective (see <xref href="IAS12_BC92.dita">BC92(a)</xref>). In particular, by removing the capping proposal,           the Board would:</p><ol type="lower-roman"><li><li_value>(i)</li_value><p>not require an entity to assess the recoverability               requirement on initial recognition of each applicable transaction to determine the               extent to which a deferred tax liability can be recognised. </p></li><li><li_value>(ii)</li_value><p>simplify the accounting when, on initial recognition,               deferred tax assets are not recognised in full. In such cases, had the capping               proposal been retained in the amendments, entities would have been required to track               separately the portions of temporary differences to which the recognition exemption               was applied.</p></li></ol></li></ol></body></paragraph>
