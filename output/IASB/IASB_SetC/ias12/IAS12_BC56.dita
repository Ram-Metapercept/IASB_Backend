Consequently, taxable profit used for assessing the utilisation of deductible temporary differences is different from taxable profit on which income taxes are payable, as defined in paragraph 5 of IAS 12. If those deductions were not excluded, then they would be counted twice. The Board has amended paragraph 29(a) to clarify this.</p></body></paragraph>
