An entity should not inappropriately assume that an asset will be recovered for more than its carrying amount. The Board thought that this is particularly important when the asset is measured at fair value. In response to that concern, the Board noted that entities will need to have sufficient evidence on which to base their estimate of probable future taxable profit, including when that estimate involves the recovery of an asset for more than its carrying amount. For example, in the case of a fixed-rate debt instrument measured at fair value, the entity may judge that the contractual nature of future cash flows, as well as the assessment of the likelihood that those contractual cash flows will be received, adequately supports the conclusion that it is probable that it will recover the fixed-rate debt instrument for more than its carrying amount, if the expected cash flows exceed the debt instrument&#x2019;s carrying amount. The Board thought that such an example could enhance understanding and reduce the risk of arbitrary estimates of future taxable profit.</p></body></paragraph>
