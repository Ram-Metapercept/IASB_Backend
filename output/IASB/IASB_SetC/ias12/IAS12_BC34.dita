For example, it could be difficult to restate goodwill and recalculate previous impairment reassessments if some information is not available and an entity is unable to separate the effects of hindsight. However, the Board reasoned that the amendments apply only to specific circumstances. Moreover, <xref base="F16220721" href="../ias08/IAS08_TOC.dita#IAS08_TOC0001" id="IAS12_X0656">IAS 8</xref> provides sufficient guidance to deal with cases when it might be impracticable to reassess impairment of goodwill or recoverability of deferred tax assets. </p></body></paragraph>
