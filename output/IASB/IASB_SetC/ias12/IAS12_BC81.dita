Specifically, an entity could recognise a       deferred tax asset and liability of different amounts if it is unable to recognise the       deferred tax asset in full (see <xref href="IAS12_gBC82-BC87.dita">paragraphs       BC82&#x2013;BC87</xref>), or if different tax rates apply to the measurement of each temporary       difference (see <xref href="IAS12_BC88.dita">paragraph BC88</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
