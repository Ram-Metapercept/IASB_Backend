Many also said that the proposed exception would solve the double&#x2011;counting problem partially but not completely. The Board noted that the aim of the exception was neither to link the accounting policy with measurement of deferred taxes (see <xref id="IAS12_X0631" base="F16220503" href="IAS12_BC7.dita#IAS12_BC7">paragraph BC7</xref>), nor to remove completely the double&#x2011;counting of tax effects (see <xref id="IAS12_X0632" base="F16220502" href="IAS12_BC15.dita#IAS12_BC15">paragraph BC15</xref>). The aim of this exception is to provide a practical approach when determination of the expected manner of recovery is difficult and subjective.</p></body></paragraph>
