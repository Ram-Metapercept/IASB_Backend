The Board could have achieved a similar result in some cases by providing application guidance on how to apply the underlying principle to investment property. However, the Board chose an exception because it is simple, straightforward and can avoid unintended consequences by a strict definition of its scope. In fact, this exception is very similar to application guidance. However, it is technically an exception because, in some cases, the asset&#x2019;s carrying amount is assumed to be recovered entirely through sale even though an entity expects it to be recovered partly through sale and partly through use.</p></body></paragraph>
