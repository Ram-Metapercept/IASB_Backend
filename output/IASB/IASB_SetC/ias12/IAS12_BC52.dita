Some other respondents were concerned that any guidance would give the false impression that future taxable profit should be estimated on an individual asset basis. The Board noted that the principle that the estimate of probable future taxable profit includes an expected recovery of assets for more than their carrying amounts is not limited to any specific type or class of assets.</p></body></paragraph>
