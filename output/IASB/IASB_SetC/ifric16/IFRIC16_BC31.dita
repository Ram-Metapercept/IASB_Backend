As illustrated in <xref id="IFRIC16_X0123" base="F15826937" href="IFRIC16_AG5.dita#IFRIC16_AG5">paragraph AG5</xref> of the application guidance, these conclusions make it possible for an entity to designate a hedged risk that is not apparent in the currencies of the hedged item or the foreign operation. This possibility is unique to hedges of net investments. Consequently, the IFRIC specified that the conclusions in the Interpretation should not be applied by analogy to other types of hedge accounting.</p></body></paragraph>
