The immediate parent entity is exposed to changes in the exchange rate of its directly held foreign operation&#x2019;s functional currency. However, indirectly every entity up the chain of entities to the ultimate parent entity is also exposed to changes in the exchange rate of the foreign operation&#x2019;s functional currency.</p></body></paragraph>
