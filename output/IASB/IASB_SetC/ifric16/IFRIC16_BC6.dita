The submission noted that consolidation can be completed by either the direct method or the step&#x2011;by&#x2011;step method. In the direct method of consolidation, each entity within a group is consolidated directly into the ultimate parent entity&#x2019;s presentation currency when preparing the consolidated financial statements. In the step&#x2011;by&#x2011;step method, each intermediate parent entity prepares consolidated financial statements, which are then consolidated into its parent entity until the ultimate parent entity has prepared consolidated financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
