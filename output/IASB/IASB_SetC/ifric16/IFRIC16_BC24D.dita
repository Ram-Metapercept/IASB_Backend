The Board noted that paragraphs AG13&#x2013;AG15 of IFRIC 16 illustrate that a non&#x2011;derivative instrument held by the foreign operation does not need to be considered to be part of the parent&#x2019;s net investment. As a result, even if it is denominated in the foreign operation&#x2019;s functional currency a non&#x2011;derivative instrument could still affect the profit or loss of the consolidated group. Consequently, although it could be argued that the amendment was not required to permit non&#x2011;derivative instruments to be designated as hedges, the Board decided that the proposal should not be changed.</p></body></paragraph>
