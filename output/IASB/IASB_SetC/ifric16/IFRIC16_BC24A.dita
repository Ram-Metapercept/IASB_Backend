The restriction was included in draft Interpretation D22 (from which IFRIC 16 was developed) and attracted little comment from respondents. As originally explained in paragraph BC24, the IFRIC concluded, as part of its redeliberations, that the restriction was appropriate because the foreign exchange differences between the parent&#x2019;s functional currency and both the hedging instrument and the functional currency of the net investment would automatically be included in the group&#x2019;s foreign currency translation reserve as part of the consolidation process.</p></body></paragraph>
