This comment was intended to remind entities that <xref base="F15826850" href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001" id="IFRIC16_X0108">IAS 39</xref> does not permit multiple hedges of the same risk. Some respondents asked the IFRIC to clarify the situations in which the IFRIC considered that the same risk was being hedged more than once. In particular, the IFRIC was asked whether the same risk could be hedged by different entities within a group as long as the amount of risk being hedged was not duplicated.</p></body></paragraph>
