Changes in foreign currency rates affect the value of the entire <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">net investment</ph></ph> in a foreign operation, not only the portion <xref base="F15826939" href="../ias21/IAS21_TOC.dita#IAS21_TOC0001" id="IFRIC16_X0125">IAS 21</xref> requires to be recognised in profit or loss in the absence of hedge accounting but also the portion recognised in other comprehensive income in the parent&#x2019;s consolidated financial statements. As noted in <xref base="F15826940" href="IFRIC16_BC25.dita#IFRIC16_BC25" id="IFRIC16_X0126">paragraph BC25</xref>, it is the total change in the hedging instrument as result of a change in the foreign currency rate with respect to the parent entity against whose functional currency the hedged risk is measured that is relevant, not the component of comprehensive income in which it is recognised.</p></body></paragraph>
