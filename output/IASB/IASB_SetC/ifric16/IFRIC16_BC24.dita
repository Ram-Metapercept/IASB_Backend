In this circumstance, hedge accounting is unnecessary. The foreign exchange differences between the parent&#x2019;s functional currency and both the hedging instrument and the functional currency of the net investment will automatically be included in the group&#x2019;s foreign currency translation reserve as part of the consolidation process. The balance of the discussion in this Basis for Conclusions does not repeat this restriction.</line-through><xref keyref="footnotes/IFRIC16_FN0004" type="fn"/></p></body></paragraph>
