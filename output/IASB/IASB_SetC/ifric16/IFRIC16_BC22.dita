This guidance was moved to <xref base="F15826854" href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001" id="IFRIC16_X0112">IAS 39</xref> to ensure that the hedge accounting guidance included in <xref base="F15826856" href="../ias39/IAS39_88.dita#IAS39_88" id="IFRIC16_X0113">paragraph 88 of IAS 39</xref> would also apply to the hedges of net investments in foreign operations.</p></body></paragraph>
