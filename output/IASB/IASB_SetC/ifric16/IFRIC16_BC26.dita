The answer to Question F.2.14 concludes:</p> <lq> <p id="IFRIC16_P0152" base="F77653125">IAS 39 does not require that the operating unit that is exposed to the risk being hedged be a party to the hedging instrument.</p></lq> <p id="IFRIC16_P0153" base="F77653126">This was the only basis for the IFRIC&#x2019;s conclusion regarding which entity could hold the hedging instrument provided in the draft Interpretation. Some respondents argued that the Interpretation should not refer to implementation guidance as the sole basis for an important conclusion.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRIC16_FN0005" type="fn"/></p></variant></body></paragraph>
