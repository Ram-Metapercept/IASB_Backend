However, the IFRIC noted that <xref base="F15827016" href="../ias21/IAS21_TOC.dita#IAS21_TOC0001" id="IFRIC16_X0132">IAS 21</xref> does not require an entity to use this method or to make adjustments to produce the same result. The IFRIC also noted that a parent entity is not precluded from determining the amount of the foreign currency translation reserve in respect of a foreign operation it has disposed of as if the direct method of consolidation had been used in order to reclassify the appropriate amount to profit or loss. However, it also noted that making such an adjustment on the disposal of a foreign operation is an accounting policy choice and should be followed consistently for the disposal of all net investments.</p></body></paragraph>
