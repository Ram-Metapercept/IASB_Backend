Therefore, the IFRIC concluded that when a foreign operation that was hedged is disposed of, the amount reclassified to profit or loss from the foreign currency translation reserve in respect of the hedging instrument in the consolidated financial statements of the parent should be the amount that <xref base="F15827015" href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001" id="IFRIC16_X0131">IAS 39</xref> requires to be identified.</p></body></paragraph>
