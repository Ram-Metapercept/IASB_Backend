One reason for this may be that the cost of annuities available on the market is expected to be significantly higher than that implied by the <xref id="IFRIC14_X0081" base="F49287172" href="../ias19/IAS19_TOC0001.dita#IAS19_TOC0001">IAS 19</xref> basis. Other costs include the legal and other professional fees expected to be incurred during the winding&#x2011;up process. Accordingly, a plan with an apparent surplus may not be able to recover any of that surplus on wind&#x2011;up.</p></body></paragraph>
