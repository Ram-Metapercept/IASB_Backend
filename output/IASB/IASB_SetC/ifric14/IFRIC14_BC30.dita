However, the IFRIC decided that, just as the future service cost was determined on the basis of the situation existing at the <u>end of the reporting period</u> <line-through>balance sheet date</line-through>, so should the effect of a minimum funding requirement. The IFRIC concluded that when determining the amount of an asset that might be available as a reduction in future contributions, an entity should not consider whether the minimum funding requirement might change in the future. The respondents to D19 were largely supportive of these conclusions.</p></body></paragraph>
