However, to the extent that the future minimum funding requirement contributions exceeded future service costs, the original version of IFRIC 14 did not permit entities to consider those economic benefits in measuring a defined benefit asset. After issuing IFRIC 14, the Board reviewed the treatment of such prepayments. The Board concluded that such a prepayment provides an economic benefit to the entity by relieving the entity of an obligation to pay future minimum funding requirement contributions that exceed future service cost. Therefore, considering those economic benefits in measuring a defined benefit asset would convey more useful information to users of financial statements. In May 2009 the Board published that conclusion in an exposure draft <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement</ph></ph>. After considering the responses to that exposure draft, the Board amended IFRIC 14 by issuing <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement</ph></ph> in November 2009.</p></body></paragraph>
