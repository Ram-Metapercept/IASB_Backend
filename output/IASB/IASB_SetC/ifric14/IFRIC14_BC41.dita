As a consequence of that amendment, the Board deleted paragraphs 25 and 26, amended paragraphs 1, 6, 17, 24 and amended Examples 1&#x2013;4 in the illustrative examples accompanying IFRIC 14. As a result of those changes paragraphs BC36 and BC37 of this Basis for Conclusions were deleted and paragraph BC5 was amended. Lastly, cross&#x2011;references to IAS 19 were updated.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
