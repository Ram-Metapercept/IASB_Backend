The IFRIC noted that assumptions are needed in respect of the size of the future workforce and future benefits provided by the plan. The IFRIC decided that the future service cost should be based on the situation that exists at the <u>end of the reporting period</u> <line-through>balance sheet date</line-through> determined in accordance with IAS 19. Therefore, increases in the size of the workforce or the benefits provided by the plan should not be anticipated. Decreases in the size of the workforce or the benefits should be included in the assumptions for the future service cost at the same time as they are treated as curtailments in accordance with <xref id="IFRIC14_X0086" base="F49287176" href="../ias19/IAS19_TOC0001.dita#IAS19_TOC0001">IAS 19</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
