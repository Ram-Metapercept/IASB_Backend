An entity shall estimate cash flows by considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment, extension, call and similar options) through the expected life of that financial instrument. The cash flows that are considered shall include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms. There is a presumption that the expected life of a financial instrument can be estimated reliably. However, in those rare cases when it is not possible to reliably estimate the expected life of a financial instrument, the entity shall use the remaining contractual term of the financial instrument.</p>   </glossdef><related-links><linklist id="GLOSSARY_P0174"><link href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_APPA.dita" id="GLOSSARY_X0082" scope="local"><linktext>IFRSÂ 9.A</linktext></link></linklist></related-links></glossentry>
