An interest in another entity can be evidenced by, but is not limited to, the holding of equity or debt instruments as well as other forms of involvement such as the provision of funding, liquidity support, credit enhancement and guarantees. It includes the means by which an entity has control or joint control of, or significant influence over, another entity. An entity does not necessarily have an interest in another entity solely because of a typical customer supplier relationship.</p> <p base="F16237122" id="GLOSSARY_P0601">Paragraphs B7&#x2013;B9 of IFRS 12 provide further information about interests in other entities.</p> <p base="F16237123" id="GLOSSARY_P0602">Paragraphs B55&#x2013;B57 of IFRS 10 explain variability of returns.</p></glossdef><related-links><linklist id="GLOSSARY_P0603"><link base="F77682903" href="../ifrs12/IFRS12_APPA.dita#IFRS12_APPA/IFRS12_APPA_TI" id="GLOSSARY_X0348"><linktext>IFRS 12.A</linktext></link></linklist></related-links></glossentry>
