A neutral depiction is not slanted, weighted, emphasised, de&#x2011;emphasised       or otherwise manipulated to increase the probability that financial information will be       received favourably or unfavourably by users. Neutral information does not mean information       with no purpose or no influence on behaviour. On the contrary, relevant financial information       is, by definition, capable of making a difference in users&#x2019; decisions.</p></body></paragraph>
