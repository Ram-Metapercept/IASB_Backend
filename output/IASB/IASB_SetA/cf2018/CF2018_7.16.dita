That statement contains a total for profit or loss that provides a highly summarised depiction of the entity&#x2019;s financial performance for the period. Many users of financial statements incorporate that total in their analysis either as a starting point for that analysis or as the main indicator of the entity&#x2019;s financial performance for the period. Nevertheless, understanding an entity&#x2019;s financial performance for the period requires an analysis of all recognised income and expenses&#x2014;including income and expenses included in other comprehensive income&#x2014;as well as an analysis of other information included in the financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
