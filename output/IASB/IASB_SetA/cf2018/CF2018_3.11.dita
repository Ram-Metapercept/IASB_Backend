If a reporting entity comprises both the parent and its subsidiaries, the reporting entity&#x2019;s financial statements are referred to as &#x2018;consolidated financial statements&#x2019; (see paragraphs 3.15&#x2013;3.16). If a reporting entity is the parent alone, the reporting entity&#x2019;s financial statements are referred to as &#x2018;unconsolidated financial statements&#x2019; (see paragraphs 3.17&#x2013;3.18).</p></body></paragraph>
