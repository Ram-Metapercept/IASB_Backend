This requires the selection of a measurement basis. A measurement basis is an identified feature&#x2014;for example, historical cost, fair value or fulfilment value&#x2014;of an item being measured. Applying a measurement basis to an asset or liability creates a measure for that asset or liability and for related income and expenses.</p></body></paragraph>
