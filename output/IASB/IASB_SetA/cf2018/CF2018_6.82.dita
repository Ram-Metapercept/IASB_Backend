For example, it may be necessary to recognise other assets, other liabilities, contributions from holders of equity claims or distributions to holders of equity claims to faithfully represent the substance of the effect of the transaction or other event on the entity&#x2019;s financial position (see paragraphs 4.59&#x2013;4.62) and any related effect on the entity&#x2019;s financial performance.</p></body></paragraph>
