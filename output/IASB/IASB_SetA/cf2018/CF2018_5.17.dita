Whether that is the case may depend on a variety of factors. For example: </p><ol id="CF2018_L0039" base="F72785965" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="CF2018_P0311" base="F72785966">if an asset is acquired or a liability is incurred in an exchange transaction on market terms, its cost generally reflects the probability of an inflow or outflow of economic benefits. Thus, that cost may be relevant information, and is generally readily available. Furthermore, not recognising the asset or liability would result in the recognition of expenses or income at the time of the exchange, which might not be a faithful representation of the transaction (see paragraph 5.25(a)).</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="CF2018_P0312" base="F72785969">if an asset or liability arises from an event that is not an exchange transaction, recognition of the asset or liability typically results in recognition of income or expenses. If there is only a low probability that the asset or liability will result in an inflow or outflow of economic benefits, users of financial statements might not regard the recognition of the asset and income, or the liability and expenses, as providing relevant information.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
