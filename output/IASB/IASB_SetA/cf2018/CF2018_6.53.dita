Depending on the characteristics of the asset or liability being measured and on the nature of the entity&#x2019;s business activities, information reflecting those changes may not always provide predictive value or confirmatory value to users of financial statements. This may be the case when the entity&#x2019;s business activities do not involve selling the asset or transferring the liability, for example, if the entity holds assets solely for use or solely for collecting contractual cash flows or if the entity is to fulfil liabilities itself.</p></body></paragraph>
