For example, if another party is seeking compensation for an entity&#x2019;s alleged act of wrongdoing, it might be uncertain whether the act occurred, whether the entity committed it or how the law applies. Until that existence uncertainty is resolved&#x2014;for example, by a court ruling&#x2014;it is uncertain whether the entity has an obligation to the party seeking compensation and, consequently, whether a liability exists. (Paragraph 5.14 discusses recognition of liabilities whose existence is uncertain.)</p></body></paragraph>
