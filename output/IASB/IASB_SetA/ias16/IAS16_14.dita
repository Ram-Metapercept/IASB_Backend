When each major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the <xref base="SL144210" href="IAS16_6.dita#IAS16_6/IAS16_P0033">carrying amount<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0026"/></ph></xref> of the item of property, plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria  are satisfied. Any remaining carrying amount of the cost of the previous inspection (as distinct from physical parts) is derecognised. This occurs regardless of whether the cost of the previous inspection was identified in the transaction in which the item was acquired or constructed. If necessary, the estimated cost of a future similar inspection may be used as an indication of what the cost of the existing inspection component was when the item was acquired or constructed.</p></body></paragraph>
