However, other factors, such as technical or commercial obsolescence and wear and tear while an asset remains idle, often result in the diminution of the economic benefits that might have been obtained from the asset. Consequently, all the following factors are considered in determining the <xref base="SL144225" href="IAS16_6.dita#IAS16_6/IAS16_P0049">useful life<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0380"/></ph></xref> of an asset: </p>       <ol id="IAS16_L0019" base="SL32099715" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>           <p id="IAS16_P0208" base="SL32099717">expected usage of the asset.
