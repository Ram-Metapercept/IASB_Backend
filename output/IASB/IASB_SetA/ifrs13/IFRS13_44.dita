The issuer of a liability issued with an inseparable third&#x2011;party credit enhancement  that is accounted for separately from the liability shall not include the effect of the credit enhancement (eg a third&#x2011;party guarantee of debt) in the fair value measurement of the liability. If the credit enhancement is accounted for separately from the liability, the issuer would take into account its own credit standing and not that of the third party guarantor when measuring the fair value of the liability. </p></body></paragraph>
