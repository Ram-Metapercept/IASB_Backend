Three widely used valuation techniques are the market approach, the <i>cost approach</i> and the income approach. The main aspects of those approaches are summarised in paragraphs B5&#x2013;B11. An entity shall use valuation techniques consistent with one or more of those approaches to measure fair value.</p></body></paragraph>
