In such circumstances it is not appropriate to conclude that all transactions in that market are not orderly (ie forced liquidations or distress sales).  Circumstances that may indicate that a transaction is not orderly include the following:</p><ol id="IFRS13_L0052" base="F16132883" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS13_P0437" base="F16132884">There was not adequate exposure to the market for a period before the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets or liabilities under current market conditions.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS13_P0438" base="F16132886">There was a usual and customary marketing period, but the seller marketed the asset or liability to a single market participant. </p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS13_P0439" base="F16132888">The seller is in or near bankruptcy or receivership (ie the seller is distressed).</p></li><li><li_value>(d)</li_value> <p id="IFRS13_P0440" base="F16132890">The seller was required to sell to meet regulatory or legal requirements (ie the seller was forced).</p></li><li><li_value>(e)</li_value> <p id="IFRS13_P0441" base="F16132892">The transaction price is an outlier when compared with other recent transactions for the same or a similar asset or liability.</p></li></ol><p id="IFRS13_P0442" base="F16132893">An entity shall evaluate the circumstances to determine whether, on the weight of the evidence available, the transaction is orderly.</p></body></paragraph>
