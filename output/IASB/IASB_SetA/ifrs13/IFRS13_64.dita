Calibration ensures that the valuation technique reflects current market conditions, and it helps an entity to determine whether an adjustment  to the valuation technique is necessary (eg there might be a characteristic of the asset or liability  that is not captured by the valuation technique). After initial recognition, when measuring fair value using a valuation technique or techniques that use unobservable inputs, an entity shall ensure that those valuation techniques reflect observable market data (eg the price for a similar asset or liability) at the measurement date.</p></body></paragraph>
