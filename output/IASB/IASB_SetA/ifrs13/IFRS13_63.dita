In other cases, multiple valuation techniques  will be appropriate (eg that might be the case when valuing a cash&#x2011;generating unit). If multiple valuation techniques are used to measure fair value, the results (ie respective indications of fair value) shall be evaluated considering the reasonableness of the range of values indicated by those results. A fair value measurement is the point within that range that is most representative of fair value in the circumstances. </p></body></paragraph>
