<paragraph id="IFRS13_69" base="F16131969"><paranum>69</paranum><prolog><data name="standard_number" value="IFRSÂ 13"/><data name="paranum" value="69"/></prolog><body><p id="IFRS13_P0163">An entity shall select inputs that are consistent with the characteristics of the asset or liability that market participants would take into account in a transaction for the asset or liability (see paragraphs 11 and 12). In some cases those characteristics result in the application of an adjustment,  such as a premium or discount (eg a control premium or non&#x2011;controlling interest discount). However, a fair value measurement shall not incorporate a premium or discount that is inconsistent with the unit of account in the IFRS that requires or permits the fair value measurement (see paragraphs 13 and 14). Premiums or discounts that reflect size as a characteristic of the entity&#x2019;s holding (specifically, a blockage factor that adjusts the quoted price of an asset or a liability because the market&#x2019;s normal daily trading volume is not sufficient to absorb the quantity held by the entity, as described in paragraph 80) rather than as a characteristic of the asset or liability (eg a control premium when measuring the fair value of a controlling interest) are not permitted in a fair value measurement.  In all cases, if there is a quoted price in an active market (ie a <i>Level 1 input</i>) for an asset or a liability, an entity shall use that price without adjustment when measuring fair value, except as specified in paragraph 79. </p></body></paragraph>
