Using the contractual payment to be received for Asset A (CU800) and the one&#x2011;year market rate derived from Asset B (10.8 per cent), the fair value of Asset A is CU722 (CU800/1.108). Alternatively, in the absence of available market information for Asset B, the one&#x2011;year market rate could be derived from Asset C using the build&#x2011;up approach. In that case the two&#x2011;year market rate indicated by Asset C (11.2 per cent) would be adjusted to a one&#x2011;year market rate using the term structure of the risk&#x2011;free yield curve. Additional information and analysis might be required to determine whether the risk premiums for one&#x2011;year and two&#x2011;year assets are the same. If it is determined that the risk premiums for one&#x2011;year and two&#x2011;year assets are not the same, the two&#x2011;year market rate of return would be further adjusted for that effect.</p></body></paragraph>
