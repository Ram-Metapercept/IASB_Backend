Comparability is established by considering the nature of the cash flows (eg whether the cash flows are contractual or non&#x2011;contractual and are likely to respond similarly to changes in economic conditions), as well as other factors (eg credit standing, collateral, duration, restrictive covenants and liquidity). Alternatively, if a single comparable asset or liability does not fairly reflect the risk inherent in the cash flows of the asset or liability being measured, it may be possible to derive a discount rate using data for several comparable assets or liabilities in conjunction with the risk&#x2011;free yield curve (ie using a &#x2018;build&#x2011;up&#x2019; approach).</p></body></paragraph>
