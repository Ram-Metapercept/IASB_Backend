They include technical and administrative work prior to the commencement of physical construction, such as the activities associated with obtaining permits prior to the commencement of the physical construction. However, such activities exclude the holding of an asset when no production or development that changes the asset&#x2019;s condition is taking place. For example, <xref base="SL138203" href="../glossary/GLOSSARY_borrowingcosts.dita#GLOSSARY_DI0023/GLOSSARY_P0066">borrowing costs<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0023"/></ph></xref> incurred while land is under development are capitalised during the period in which activities related to the development are being undertaken. However, borrowing costs incurred while land acquired for building purposes is held without any associated development activity do not qualify for capitalisation.</p></body></paragraph>
