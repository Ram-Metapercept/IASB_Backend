Such a difficulty occurs, for example, when the financing activity of an entity is co&#x2011;ordinated centrally. Difficulties also arise when a group uses a range of debt instruments to borrow funds at varying rates of interest, and lends those funds on various bases to other entities in the group. Other complications arise through the use of loans denominated in or linked to foreign currencies, when the group operates in highly inflationary economies, and from fluctuations in exchange rates. As a result, the determination of the amount of <xref base="F3101210" href="IAS23_5.dita#IAS23_5/IAS23_P0019">borrowing costs<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0023"/></ph></xref> that are directly attributable to the acquisition of a qualifying asset is difficult and the exercise of judgement is required.</p></body></paragraph>
