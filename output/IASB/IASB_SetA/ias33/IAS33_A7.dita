In the calculation of diluted earnings per share, those options or warrants have a dilutive effect if (a) the average market price of the related <xref base="SL148104" href="IAS33_5.dita#IAS33_5/IAS33_P0023">ordinary shares<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0275"/></ph></xref> for the period  exceeds the exercise price or (b) the selling price of the instrument to be tendered is below that at which the instrument may be tendered under the option or warrant agreement and the resulting discount establishes an effective exercise price below the market price of the ordinary shares obtainable upon exercise. In the calculation of diluted earnings per share, those options or warrants are assumed to be exercised and the debt or other instruments are assumed to be tendered. If tendering cash is more advantageous to the option or warrant holder and the contract permits tendering cash, tendering of cash is assumed. Interest (net of tax) on any debt assumed to be tendered is added back as an adjustment to the numerator.</p></body></paragraph>
