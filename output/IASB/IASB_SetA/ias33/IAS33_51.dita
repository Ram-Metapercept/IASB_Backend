In such cases, any excess consideration referred to in <xref id="IAS33_X0161" base="A33-136" href="IAS33_17.dita#IAS33_17">paragraph 17</xref> is attributed to those shares that are redeemed or converted for the purpose of determining whether the remaining outstanding preference shares are dilutive. The shares redeemed or converted are considered separately from those shares that are not redeemed or converted.</p></body></paragraph>
