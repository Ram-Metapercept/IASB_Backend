However, when the overall effect is a share repurchase at <xref base="SL147212" href="../ias32/IAS32_11.dita#IAS32_11/IAS32_P0107">fair value<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0118"/></ph></xref>, the reduction in the number of ordinary shares outstanding is the result of a corresponding reduction in resources. An example is a share consolidation combined with a special dividend. The weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the period in which the combined transaction takes place is adjusted for the reduction in the number of ordinary shares from the date the special dividend is recognised.</p></body></paragraph>
