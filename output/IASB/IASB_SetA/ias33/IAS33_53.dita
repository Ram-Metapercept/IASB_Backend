In that case, the calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the number of ordinary shares that would be issued if the amount of earnings at the end of the reporting period were the amount of earnings at the end of the contingency period. Because earnings may change in a future period, the calculation of basic earnings per share does not include such <xref base="SL148101" href="IAS33_5.dita#IAS33_5/IAS33_P0020">contingently issuable ordinary shares<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0048"/></ph></xref> until the end of the contingency period because not all necessary conditions have been satisfied.</p></body></paragraph>
