Rather, the entity must consider all of the terms and conditions of the financial instrument in determining its classification as a financial liability or equity. Those terms and conditions include relevant local laws, regulations and the entity&#x2019;s governing charter in effect at the date of classification, but not expected future amendments to those laws, regulations or charter.</p></body></paragraph>
