Local law governing the operations of co&#x2011;operative banks state that at least 50 per cent of the entity&#x2019;s total &#x2018;outstanding liabilities&#x2019; (a term defined in the regulations to include members&#x2019; share accounts) has to be in the form of members&#x2019; paid&#x2011;in capital. The effect of the regulation is that if all of a co&#x2011;operative&#x2019;s outstanding liabilities are in the form of members&#x2019; shares, it is able to redeem them all. On 31 December 20X1 the entity has total outstanding liabilities of CU200,000, of which CU125,000 represent members&#x2019; share accounts. The terms of the members&#x2019; share accounts permit the holder to redeem them on demand and there are no limitations on redemption in the entity&#x2019;s charter.</p></body></paragraph>
