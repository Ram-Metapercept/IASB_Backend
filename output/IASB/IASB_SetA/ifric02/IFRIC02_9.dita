An unconditional prohibition may be partial, in that it prohibits redemption of members&#x2019; shares if redemption would cause the number of members&#x2019; shares or amount of paid&#x2011;in capital from members&#x2019; shares to fall below a specified level. Members&#x2019; shares in excess of the prohibition against redemption are liabilities, unless the entity has the unconditional right to refuse redemption as described in <xref id="IFRIC02_X0045" base="F6037739" href="IFRIC02_7.dita#IFRIC02_7">paragraph 7</xref> or the members&#x2019; shares have all the features and meet the conditions in <xref id="IFRIC02_X0046" base="F6037740" href="../ias32/IAS32_g16A-16B.dita#IAS32_g16A-16B/IAS32_g16A-16B_TI">paragraphs 16A and 16B</xref> or <xref id="IFRIC02_X0047" base="F6037741" href="../ias32/IAS32_g16C-16D.dita#IAS32_g16C-16D/IAS32_g16C-16D_TI">paragraphs 16C and 16D of IAS 32</xref>. In some cases, the number of shares or the amount of paid&#x2011;in capital subject to a redemption prohibition may change from time to time. Such a change in the redemption prohibition leads to a transfer between financial liabilities and equity.</p></body></paragraph>
