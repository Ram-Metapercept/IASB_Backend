The co-operative entity measures this financial liability at fair value at initial recognition. Because these shares are redeemable on demand, the co-operative entity measures the fair value of such financial liabilities in accordance with <xref id="IFRIC02_X0080" base="F34423577" href="../ifrs13/IFRS13_47.dita#IFRS13_47">paragraph 47 of IFRS 13</xref>: &#x2018;The fair value of a financial liability with a demand feature (eg a demand deposit) is not less than the amount payable on demand &#x2026;&#x2019;.
