The payment of funded benefits when they fall due depends not only on the financial position and the investment performance of the fund but also on an entity&#x2019;s ability, and willingness, to make good any shortfall in the fund&#x2019;s assets. Therefore, the entity is, in substance, underwriting the actuarial and investment risks associated with the plan. Consequently, the expense recognised for a defined benefit plan is not necessarily the amount of the contribution due for the period.</p></body></paragraph>
