A group administration plan is merely an aggregation of single employer plans combined to allow participating employers to pool their assets for investment purposes and reduce investment management and administration costs, but the claims of different employers are segregated for the sole benefit of their own employees. Group administration plans pose no particular accounting problems because information is readily available to treat them in the same way as any other single employer plan and because such plans do not expose the participating entities to actuarial risks associated with the current and former employees of other entities. The definitions in this Standard require an entity to classify a group administration plan as a <xref base="F16148509" href="IAS19_0002.dita#IAS19_0002/IAS19_UN0007">defined contribution plan<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0080"/></ph></xref> or a <xref base="F16149637" href="IAS19_0002.dita#IAS19_0002/IAS19_UN0008">defined benefit plan<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0078"/></ph></xref> in accordance with the terms of the plan (including any constructive obligation that goes beyond the formal terms).</p></body></paragraph>
