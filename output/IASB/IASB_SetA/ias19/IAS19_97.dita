An entity estimates future medical costs on the basis of historical data about the entity&#x2019;s own experience, supplemented where necessary by historical data from other entities, insurance companies, medical providers or other sources. Estimates of future medical costs consider the effect of technological advances, changes in health care utilisation or delivery patterns and changes in the health status of plan participants.</p></body></paragraph>
