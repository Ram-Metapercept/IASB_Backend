Many state plans are funded on a pay&#x2011;as&#x2011;you&#x2011;go basis: contributions are set at a level that is expected to be sufficient to pay the required benefits falling due in the same period; future benefits earned during the current period will be paid out of future contributions. Nevertheless, in most state plans the entity has no legal or constructive obligation to pay those future benefits: its only obligation is to pay the contributions as they fall due and if the entity ceases to employ members of the state plan, it will have no obligation to pay the benefits earned by its own employees in previous years. For this reason, state plans are normally <xref base="F16148509" href="IAS19_0002.dita#IAS19_0002/IAS19_UN0007">defined contribution plans<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0080"/></ph></xref>.
