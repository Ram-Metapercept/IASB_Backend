An acquired intangible asset meets the separability criterion if there is evidence of exchange transactions for that type of asset or an asset of a similar type, even if those transactions are infrequent and regardless of whether the acquirer is involved in them. For example, customer and subscriber lists are frequently licensed and thus meet the separability criterion. Even if an acquiree believes its customer lists have characteristics different from other customer lists, the fact that customer lists are frequently licensed generally means that the acquired customer list meets the separability criterion. However, a customer list acquired in a <xref base="F4230842" href="IFRS03_APPA.dita#IFRS03_APPA/IFRS03_P0304">business combination<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0025"/></ph></xref> would not meet the separability criterion if the terms of confidentiality or other agreements prohibit an entity from selling, leasing or otherwise exchanging information about its customers.</p></body></paragraph>
