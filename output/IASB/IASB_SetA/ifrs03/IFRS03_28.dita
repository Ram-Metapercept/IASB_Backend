For example, an indemnification may relate to a contingent liability that is not recognised at the <xref base="F4230836" href="IFRS03_APPA.dita#IFRS03_APPA/IFRS03_P0298">acquisition date<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0006"/></ph></xref> because its <xref base="F16141310" href="IFRS03_APPA.dita#IFRS03_APPA/IFRS03_P0309">fair value<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0118"/></ph></xref> is not reliably measurable at that date. Alternatively, an indemnification may relate to an asset or a liability, for example, one that results from an employee benefit, that is measured on a basis other than <xref base="F4230836" href="IFRS03_APPA.dita#IFRS03_APPA/IFRS03_P0298">acquisition&#x2011;date<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0006"/></ph></xref> fair value. In those circumstances, the indemnification asset shall be recognised and measured using assumptions consistent with those used to measure the indemnified item, subject to management&#x2019;s assessment of the collectibility of the indemnification asset and any contractual limitations on the indemnified amount. <xref id="IFRS03_X0196" base="F5309954" href="IFRS03_g57-57.dita#IFRS03_g57-57">Paragraph 57</xref> provides guidance on the subsequent accounting for an indemnification asset.</p></body></paragraph>
