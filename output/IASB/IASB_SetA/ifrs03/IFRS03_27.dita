For example, the seller may indemnify the acquirer against losses above a specified amount on a liability arising from a particular contingency; in other words, the seller will guarantee that the acquirer&#x2019;s liability will not exceed a specified amount. As a result, the acquirer obtains an indemnification asset. The acquirer shall recognise an indemnification asset at the same time that it recognises the indemnified item measured on the same basis as the indemnified item, subject to the need for a valuation allowance for uncollectible amounts. Therefore, if the indemnification relates to an asset or a liability that is recognised at the <xref base="F4230836" href="IFRS03_APPA.dita#IFRS03_APPA/IFRS03_P0298">acquisition date<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0006"/></ph></xref> and measured at its acquisition&#x2011;date <xref base="F16141310" href="IFRS03_APPA.dita#IFRS03_APPA/IFRS03_P0309">fair value<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0118"/></ph></xref>, the acquirer shall recognise the indemnification asset at the acquisition date measured at its acquisition&#x2011;date fair value. For an indemnification asset measured at fair value, the effects of uncertainty about future cash flows because of collectibility considerations are included in the fair value measure and a separate valuation allowance is not necessary (<xref id="IFRS03_X0195" base="F5309952" href="IFRS03_gB41-B41.dita#IFRS03_gB41-B41">paragraph B41</xref> provides related application guidance).</p></body></paragraph>
