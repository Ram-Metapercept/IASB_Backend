This gain or loss on the net monetary position may be derived as the difference resulting from the restatement of non&#x2011;monetary assets,  owners&#x2019; equity and items in the statement of comprehensive income and the adjustment of index linked assets and liabilities. The gain or loss may be estimated by applying the change in a general price index to the weighted average for the period of the difference between monetary assets and monetary liabilities.</p></body></paragraph>
