It is also used in the development of an accounting policy only when no Standards specifically apply to a particular transaction, other event or condition, or deal with similar and related issues. Consequently the guidance in the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> relating to the use of a particular capital maintenance concept cannot be used to override the requirements of any Standard, and an entity is not permitted to apply a concept of capital maintenance that conflicts with the existing requirements in a particular Standard, when applying that Standard.</p>       <p>In addition, the Interpretations Committee noted that the results of the outreach indicate that these issues are not widespread. For this reason the Interpretations Committee decided not to add these issues to its agenda.]</p>       </fn>                <fn base="IAS29_34" id="EDUFN-ad2020-march-ap4C_IAS21andIAS29">             <p outputclass="keep_with_next">The Committee received a request about the application of IAS 21 and IAS 29.
