Offsetting in the statement(s) of profit or loss and other comprehensive income or financial position, except when offsetting reflects the substance of the transaction or other event, detracts from the ability of users                     both to understand the transactions, other events and conditions that have occurred and to assess the entity&#x2019;s future cash flows. Measuring assets net of valuation allowances&#x2014;for example, obsolescence allowances on inventories and doubtful debts allowances on receivables&#x2014;is not offsetting.</p></body></paragraph>
