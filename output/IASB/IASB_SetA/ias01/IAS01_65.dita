Financial assets include trade and other receivables, and financial liabilities include trade and other payables. Information on the expected date of recovery of non&#x2011;monetary assets such as inventories and expected date of settlement for liabilities such as provisions is also useful, whether assets and liabilities are classified as current or as non&#x2011;current. For example, an entity discloses the amount of inventories that are expected to be recovered more than twelve months after the reporting period.</p></body></paragraph>
