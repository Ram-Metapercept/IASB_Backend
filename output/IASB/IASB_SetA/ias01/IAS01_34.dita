For example, the amount of revenue recognised reflects any trade discounts and volume rebates the entity allows. An entity undertakes, in the course of its ordinary activities, other transactions that do not generate revenue but are incidental to the main revenue&#x2011;generating activities. An entity presents the results of such transactions, when this presentation reflects the substance                  of the transaction or other event, by netting any income with related expenses arising on the same transaction. For example:</p>       <ol base="F32652404" id="IAS01_L0018" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>           <p base="F32652406" id="IAS01_P0191">an entity presents gains and losses on the disposal of non&#x2011;current assets, including investments and operating assets, by deducting from the amount of consideration on disposal the carrying amount of the asset and related selling expenses; and</p>         </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>           <p base="F32652408" id="IAS01_P0192">an entity may net expenditure related to a provision that is recognised in accordance with <xref base="F32652411" href="../ias37/IAS37_TOC.dita#IAS37_TOC0001" id="IAS01_X0233">IAS 37 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets</ph></ph></xref> and reimbursed under a contractual arrangement with a third party (for example, a supplier&#x2019;s warranty agreement) against the related reimbursement.                        </p>         </li></ol>     </variant></body></paragraph>
