It also states that &#x2018;the frequency of an entity&#x2019;s reporting (annual, half&#x2011;yearly, or quarterly) shall not affect the measurement of its annual results. To achieve that objective, measurements for interim reporting purposes shall be made on a year&#x2011;to&#x2011;date basis.&#x2019;</p></body></paragraph>
