Usually, it is not possible to measure directly the services received for particular components of the employee&#x2019;s remuneration package.

Furthermore, shares or share options are sometimes granted as part of a bonus arrangement, rather than as a part of basic remuneration, eg as an incentive to the employees to remain in the entity&#x2019;s employ or to reward them for their efforts in improving the entity&#x2019;s performance. By granting shares or share options, in addition to other remuneration, the entity is paying additional remuneration to obtain additional benefits. Estimating the fair value of those additional benefits is likely to be difficult. Because of the difficulty of measuring directly the fair value of the services received, the entity shall measure the fair value of the employee services received by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.</p></body></paragraph>
