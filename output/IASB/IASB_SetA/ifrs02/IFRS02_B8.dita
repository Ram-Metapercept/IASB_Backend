This factor shall be taken into account if the option pricing model applied would otherwise assume that the option could be exercised at any time during its life. However, if an entity uses an option pricing model that values options that can be exercised only at the end of the options&#x2019; life, no adjustment is required for the inability to exercise them during the vesting period (or other periods during the options&#x2019; life), because the model assumes that the options cannot be exercised during those periods.</p></body></paragraph>
