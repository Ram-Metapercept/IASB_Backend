It may be necessary to use an appropriate substitute, if no such government issues exist or circumstances indicate that the implied yield on zero&#x2011;coupon government issues is not representative of the risk&#x2011;free interest rate (for example, in high inflation economies). Also, an appropriate substitute should be used if market participants would typically determine the risk&#x2011;free interest rate by using that substitute, rather than the implied yield of zero&#x2011;coupon government issues, when estimating the <xref base="SL141007" href="IFRS02_APPA.dita#IFRS02_APPA/IFRS02_P0249">fair value<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0119"/></ph></xref> of an option with a life equal to the expected term of the option being valued.</p></body></paragraph>
