For example, if an entity&#x2019;s share price was extraordinarily volatile for some identifiable period of time because of a failed takeover bid or a major restructuring, that period could be disregarded in computing historical average annual volatility.</p></li><li><li_value>(e)</li_value> <p id="IFRS02_P0338" base="SL141085">appropriate and regular intervals for price observations. The price observations should be consistent from period to period. For example, an entity might use the closing price for each week or the highest price for the week, but it should not use the closing price for some weeks and the highest price for other weeks. Also, the price observations should be expressed in the same currency as the exercise price.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
