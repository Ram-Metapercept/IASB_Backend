For example, to say that a share with an expected continuously compounded rate of return of 12 per cent has a volatility of 30 per cent means that the probability that the rate of return on the share for one year will be between &#x2013;18 per cent (12% &#x2013; 30%) and 42 per cent (12% + 30%) is approximately two&#x2011;thirds. If the share price is CU100 at the beginning of the year and no dividends are paid, the year&#x2011;end share price would be expected to be between CU83.53 (CU100 × e<sup>&#x2013;0.18</sup>) and CU152.20 (CU100 × e<sup>0.42</sup>) approximately two&#x2011;thirds of the time.</p></body></paragraph>
