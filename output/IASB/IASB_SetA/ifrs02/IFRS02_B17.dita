For example, expected early exercise could be taken into account by using an estimate of the option&#x2019;s expected life (which, for an employee <xref base="SL141034" href="IFRS02_APPA.dita#IFRS02_APPA/IFRS02_P0290">share option<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0352"/></ph></xref>, is the period of time from <xref base="SL141010" href="IFRS02_APPA.dita#IFRS02_APPA/IFRS02_P0250">grant date<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0152"/></ph></xref> to the date on which the option is expected to be exercised) as an input into an option pricing model (eg the Black&#x2011;Scholes&#x2011;Merton formula). Alternatively, expected early exercise could be modelled in a binomial or similar option pricing model that uses contractual life as an input.</p></body></paragraph>
