Option value is not a linear function of option term; value increases at a decreasing rate as the term lengthens. For example, if all other assumptions are equal, although a two&#x2011;year option is worth more than a one&#x2011;year option, it is not worth twice as much. That means that calculating estimated option value on the basis of a single weighted average life that includes widely differing individual lives would overstate the total <xref base="SL141007" href="IFRS02_APPA.dita#IFRS02_APPA/IFRS02_P0249">fair value<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0119"/></ph></xref> of the <xref base="SL141034" href="IFRS02_APPA.dita#IFRS02_APPA/IFRS02_P0290">share options<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0352"/></ph></xref> granted. Separating options granted into several groups, each of which has a relatively narrow range of lives included in its weighted average life, reduces that overstatement.</p></body></paragraph>
