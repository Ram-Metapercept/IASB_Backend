This rate is estimated from the rate implicit in current market transactions for similar assets or from the weighted average cost of capital of a listed entity that has a single asset (or a portfolio of assets) similar in terms of service potential and risks to the asset under review. However, the discount rate(s) used to measure an asset&#x2019;s <xref base="SL148465" href="IAS36_6.dita#IAS36_6/IAS36_P0112">value in use<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0382"/></ph></xref> shall not reflect risks for which the future cash flow estimates have been adjusted. Otherwise, the effect of some assumptions will be double&#x2011;counted.</p></body></paragraph>
