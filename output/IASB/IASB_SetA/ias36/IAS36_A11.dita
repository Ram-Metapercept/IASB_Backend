In addition, accountants often face the need to measure an asset using limited information about the probabilities of possible cash flows. For example, an accountant might be confronted with the following situations: </p><ol id="IAS36_L0075" base="SL148885" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IAS36_P0583" base="SL148887">the estimated amount falls somewhere between CU50 and CU250, but no amount in the range is more likely than any other amount.
