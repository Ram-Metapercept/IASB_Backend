This is because the asset or group of assets could generate cash inflows that would be largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. In using information based on financial budgets/forecasts that relates to such a cash&#x2011;generating unit, or to any other asset or cash&#x2011;generating unit affected by internal transfer pricing,  an entity adjusts this information if internal transfer prices do not reflect management&#x2019;s best estimate of future prices that could be achieved in arm&#x2019;s length transactions.</p></body></paragraph>
