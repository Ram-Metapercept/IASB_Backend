Some question whether assigning probabilities to highly subjective estimates suggests greater precision than, in fact, exists. However, the proper application of the traditional approach (as described in <xref id="IAS36_X0443" base="A36-270" href="IAS36_A6.dita#IAS36_A6">paragraph A6</xref>) requires the same estimates and subjectivity without providing the computational transparency of the expected cash flow approach.</p></body></paragraph>
