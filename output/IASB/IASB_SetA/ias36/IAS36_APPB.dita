It is superseded when IAS 36 <none>Impairment of Assets</none> (as revised in 2004) becomes effective. This appendix replaces the consequential amendments made by IAS 16 (as revised in 2003) to IAS 36 <none>Impairment of Assets</none> (issued in 1998). IAS 36 (as revised in 2004) incorporates the requirements of the paragraphs in this appendix. Consequently, the amendments from IAS 16 (as revised in 2003) are not necessary once an entity is subject to IAS 36 (as revised in 2004). Accordingly, this appendix is applicable only to entities that elect to apply IAS 16 (as revised in 2003) before its effective date.</p></note><table id="IAS36_TAB0008" base="SL78019" frame="none" orient="port" pgwide="1"><tgroup cols="1"><colspec colnum="1" colname="C1" colwidth="10*" colsep="0" rowsep="0" align="left"/><tbody><row><entry colname="C1" align="center"> <p id="IAS36_P0608" typeface="sansserif">* * * * *</p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p id="IAS36_P0609" base="SL148914"><i>The text of this appendix has been omitted from this volume.</i></p></body></topic>
