However, the following general principles govern any application of present value techniques in measuring assets: </p><ol id="IAS36_L0073" base="SL148864" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IAS36_P0540" base="SL148866">interest rates used to discount cash flows should reflect assumptions that are consistent with those inherent in the estimated cash flows. Otherwise, the effect of some assumptions will be double&#x2011;counted or ignored. For example, a discount rate of 12 per cent might be applied to contractual cash flows of a loan receivable. That rate reflects expectations about future defaults from loans with particular characteristics. That same 12 per cent rate should not be used to discount expected cash flows because those cash flows already reflect assumptions about future defaults.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IAS36_P0541" base="SL148868">estimated cash flows and discount rates should be free from both bias and factors unrelated to the asset in question. For example, deliberately understating estimated net cash flows to enhance the apparent future profitability of an asset introduces a bias into the measurement.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IAS36_P0542" base="SL148870">estimated cash flows or discount rates should reflect the range of possible outcomes rather than a single most likely, minimum or maximum possible amount.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
