However, sometimes it will not be possible to measure fair value less costs of disposal because there is no basis for making a reliable estimate of the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions.  In this case, the entity may use the asset&#x2019;s value in use as its recoverable amount.</p></body></paragraph>
