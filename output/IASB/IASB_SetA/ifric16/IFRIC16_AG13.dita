Because both its assets and liabilities increased by £159 million, Subsidiary B&#x2019;s net assets are unchanged. Subsidiary B could designate the external debt as a hedge of the GBP/USD risk of its net investment in Subsidiary C in its consolidated financial statements. Parent could maintain Subsidiary B&#x2019;s designation of that hedging instrument as a hedge of its US$300 million net investment in Subsidiary C for the GBP/USD risk (see paragraph 13) and Parent could designate the GBP hedging instrument it holds as a hedge of its entire £500 million net investment in Subsidiary B. The first hedge, designated by Subsidiary B, would be assessed by reference to Subsidiary B&#x2019;s functional currency (pounds sterling) and the second hedge, designated by Parent, would be assessed by reference to Parent&#x2019;s functional currency (euro). In this case, only the GBP/USD risk from Parent&#x2019;s net investment in Subsidiary C has been hedged in Parent&#x2019;s consolidated financial statements by the USD hedging instrument, not the entire EUR/USD risk. Therefore, the entire EUR/GBP risk from Parent&#x2019;s £500 million net investment in Subsidiary B may be hedged in the consolidated financial statements of Parent.</p></body></paragraph>
