Such issues arise in the accounting for expenditure on the exploration for, or development and extraction of, oil, gas and mineral deposits in extractive industries and in the case of insurance contracts. Therefore, this Standard does not apply to expenditure on such activities and contracts. However, this Standard applies to other <xref base="SL141716" href="IAS38_8.dita#IAS38_8/IAS38_P0070">intangible assets<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0193"/></ph></xref> used (such as computer software), and other expenditure incurred (such as start&#x2011;up costs), in extractive industries or by insurers.</p></body></paragraph>
