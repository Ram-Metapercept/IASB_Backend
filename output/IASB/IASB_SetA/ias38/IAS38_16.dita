However, in the absence of legal rights to protect, or other ways to control, the relationships with customers or the loyalty of the customers to the entity, the entity usually has insufficient control over the expected economic benefits from customer relationships and loyalty for such items (eg portfolio of customers, market shares, customer relationships and customer loyalty) to meet the definition of <xref base="SL141716" href="IAS38_8.dita#IAS38_8/IAS38_P0070">intangible assets<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0193"/></ph></xref>. In the absence of legal rights to protect customer relationships, exchange transactions for the same or similar non&#x2011;contractual customer relationships (other than as part of a business combination) provide evidence that the entity is nonetheless able to control the expected future economic benefits  flowing from the customer relationships. Because such exchange transactions also provide evidence that the customer relationships are separable, those customer relationships meet the definition of an intangible asset.</p></body></paragraph>
