The fair value of an intangible asset will reflect market participants&#x2019;  expectations  at the acquisition date about the probability that the expected future economic benefits embodied in the asset will flow to the entity. In other words, the entity expects there to be an inflow of economic benefits, even if there is uncertainty about the timing or the amount of the inflow. Therefore, the probability recognition criterion in <xref base="F5312989" href="IAS38_21.dita#IAS38_21" id="IAS38_X0223">paragraph 21(a)</xref> is always considered to be satisfied for intangible assets acquired in business combinations. If an asset acquired in a business combination is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights, sufficient information exists to measure reliably the fair value of the asset. Thus, the reliable measurement criterion in <xref base="F5312990" href="IAS38_21.dita#IAS38_21" id="IAS38_X0224">paragraph 21(b)</xref> is always considered to be satisfied for intangible assets acquired in business combinations.</p></body></paragraph>
