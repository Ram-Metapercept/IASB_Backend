The revenue generated by an activity that includes the         use of an intangible asset typically reflects factors that are not directly linked to the         consumption of the economic benefits embodied in the intangible asset. For example, revenue         is affected by other inputs and processes, selling activities and changes in sales volumes         and prices. The price component of revenue may be affected by inflation, which has no         bearing upon the way in which an asset is consumed. This presumption can be overcome only in         the limited circumstances:</p> <ol id="IAS38_L0032" base="F32047730" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IAS38_P0274" base="F32047731">in which the intangible asset is expressed as a measure of revenue, as described in <xref id="IAS38_X0304" base="F34942884" href="IAS38_98C.dita#IAS38_98C/IAS38_98C_V1">paragraph 98C</xref>; or</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IAS38_P0275" base="F32048902">when it can be demonstrated that revenue and the consumption of the economic benefits of the intangible asset are highly correlated.</p></li></ol> </variant></body></paragraph>
