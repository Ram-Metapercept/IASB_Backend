The following discussion refers simply to an exchange of one non&#x2011;monetary asset for another, but it also applies to all exchanges described in the preceding sentence.

The acquired asset is measured in this way even if an entity cannot immediately derecognise the asset given up. If the acquired asset is not measured at fair value, its cost is measured at the <xref base="SL141709" href="IAS38_8.dita#IAS38_8/IAS38_P0063">carrying amount<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0026"/></ph></xref> of the asset given up.</p></body></paragraph>
