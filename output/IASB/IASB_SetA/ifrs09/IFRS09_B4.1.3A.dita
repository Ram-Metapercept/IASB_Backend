To determine whether there has been an increase in the assets&#x2019; credit risk, the entity considers reasonable and supportable information, including forward looking information. Irrespective of their frequency and value, sales due to an increase in the assets&#x2019; credit risk are not inconsistent with a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows because the credit quality of financial assets is relevant to the entity&#x2019;s ability to collect contractual cash flows. Credit risk management activities that are aimed at minimising potential <xref base="F32570619" href="IFRS09_APPA.dita#IFRS09_APPA/IFRS09_P0681">credit losses<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0063"/></ph></xref> due to credit deterioration are integral to such a business model. Selling a financial asset because it no longer meets the credit criteria specified in the entity&#x2019;s documented investment policy is an example of a sale that has occurred due to an increase in credit risk. However, in the absence of such a policy, the entity may demonstrate in other ways that the sale occurred due to an increase in credit risk.</p></body></paragraph>
