Furthermore, insurance contracts are often subject to accounting requirements that are distinct from the requirements for other types of transaction, such as contracts issued by banks or commercial companies. In such cases, an issuer&#x2019;s financial statements typically include a statement that the issuer has used those accounting requirements.</p></body></paragraph>
