An entity acquires a financial asset for CU100 plus a purchase commission of CU2. Initially, the entity recognises the asset at CU102. The reporting period ends one day later, when the quoted market price of the asset is CU100. If the asset were sold, a commission of CU3 would be paid.

If the financial asset is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income in accordance with paragraph 4.1.2A, the transaction costs are amortised to profit or loss using the <xref base="F32570653" href="IFRS09_APPA.dita#IFRS09_APPA/IFRS09_P0696">effective interest method<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0096"/></ph></xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
