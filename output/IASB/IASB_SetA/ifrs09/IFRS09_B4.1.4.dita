The funding needs of the entity are predictable and the maturity of its financial assets is matched to the entity&#x2019;s estimated funding needs.</p> <p id="IFRS09_P1010" base="F32571285">The entity performs credit risk management activities with the objective of minimising <xref base="F32570619" href="IFRS09_APPA.dita#IFRS09_APPA/IFRS09_P0681">credit losses<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0063"/></ph></xref>. In the past, sales have typically occurred when the financial assets&#x2019; credit risk has increased such that the assets no longer meet the credit criteria specified in the entity&#x2019;s documented investment policy. In addition, infrequent sales have occurred as a result of unanticipated funding needs.</p> <p id="IFRS09_P1011" base="F32571286">Reports to key management personnel focus on the credit quality of the financial assets and the contractual return.

Sales would not contradict that objective if they were in response to an increase in the assets&#x2019; credit risk, for example if the assets no longer meet the credit criteria specified in the entity&#x2019;s documented investment policy. Infrequent sales resulting from unanticipated funding needs (eg in a stress case scenario) also would not contradict that objective, even if such sales are significant in value.</p></entry></row><row><entry colname="C1" align="left" valign="top"> <p id="IFRS09_P1013" base="F32571321"><b><sansserif>Example 2</sansserif></b></p> <p id="IFRS09_P1014" base="F32571324">An entity&#x2019;s business model is to purchase portfolios of financial assets, such as loans.

Whether a third party imposes the requirement to sell the financial assets, or that activity is at the entity&#x2019;s discretion, is not relevant to the analysis.</p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></body></paragraph>
