For example, assume that the gross carrying amount of the asset on the date of the transfer is CU98 and that the consideration received is CU95. The gross carrying amount of the asset on the option exercise date will be CU100. The initial carrying amount of the associated liability is CU95 and the difference between CU95 and CU100 is recognised in profit or loss using the <xref base="F32570653" href="IFRS09_APPA.dita#IFRS09_APPA/IFRS09_P0696">effective interest method<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0096"/></ph></xref>. If the option is exercised, any difference between the carrying amount of the associated liability and the exercise price is recognised in profit or loss.</p></li></ol></bodydiv></body></topic>
