The entity may restate prior periods only if it is possible to do so without the         use of hindsight. If an entity restates prior periods, the restated financial statements         must reflect all the requirements in this Standard for the affected financial instruments.         If an entity does not restate prior periods, the entity shall recognise any difference         between the previous carrying amount and the carrying amount at the beginning of the annual         reporting period that includes the date of initial application of these amendments in the         opening retained earnings (or other component of equity, as appropriate) of the annual         reporting period that includes the date of initial application of these amendments.</p></body></paragraph>
