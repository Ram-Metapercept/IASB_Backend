This practical expedient applies only to such changes and only to the extent the change is required by interest rate benchmark reform (see also <xref href="IFRS09_5.4.9.dita">paragraph 5.4.9</xref>). For this purpose, a change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows is required by interest rate benchmark reform if, and only if, both these conditions are met: </p><ol><li><li_value>(a)</li_value><p>the change is necessary as a direct consequence of interest rate benchmark reform; and</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value><p>the new basis for determining the contractual cash flows is economically equivalent to the previous basis (ie the basis immediately preceding the change).</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
