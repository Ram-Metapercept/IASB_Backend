For example, if the financial asset under assessment contains a variable interest rate that is reset every month to a one-year interest rate, the entity would compare that financial asset to a financial instrument with identical contractual terms and the identical credit risk except the variable interest rate is reset monthly to a one-month interest rate. If the modified time value of money element could result in contractual (undiscounted) cash flows that are significantly different from the (undiscounted) benchmark cash flows, the financial asset does not meet the condition in <xref id="IFRS09_X1199" base="F41907840" href="IFRS09_4.1.2.dita#IFRS09_4.1.2">paragraphs 4.1.2(b)</xref> and <xref id="IFRS09_X1200" base="F41907841" href="IFRS09_4.1.2A.dita#IFRS09_4.1.2A">4.1.2A(b)</xref>. To make this determination, the entity must consider the effect of the modified time value of money element in each reporting period and cumulatively over the life of the financial instrument. The reason for the interest rate being set in this way is not relevant to the analysis. If it is clear, with little or no analysis, whether the contractual (undiscounted) cash flows on the financial asset under the assessment could (or could not) be significantly different from the (undiscounted) benchmark cash flows, an entity need not perform a detailed assessment.</p></body></paragraph>
