It is typically observable through the activities that the entity undertakes to achieve the objective of the business model. An entity will need to use judgement when it assesses its business model for managing financial assets and that assessment is not determined by a single factor or activity. Instead, the entity must consider all relevant evidence that is available at the date of the assessment. Such relevant evidence includes, but is not limited to:</p><ol id="IFRS09_L0102" base="F32571272" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P0996" base="F32571273">how the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the entity&#x2019;s key management personnel;</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P0997" base="F32571275">the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way in which those risks are managed; and</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P0998" base="F32571277">how managers of the business are compensated (for example, whether the compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected).</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
