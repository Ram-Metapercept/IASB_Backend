Subsequently, the same measurement that was used before designating the financial instrument at fair value through profit or loss shall be applied (including amortisation that results from the new carrying amount). For example, a financial asset that had originally been classified as measured at <xref base="F32570588" href="IFRS09_APPA.dita#IFRS09_APPA/IFRS09_P0666">amortised cost<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0013"/></ph></xref> would revert to that measurement and its effective interest rate would be recalculated based on its new gross carrying amount on the date of discontinuing measurement at fair value through profit or loss.</p></body></paragraph>
