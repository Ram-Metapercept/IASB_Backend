Entity A has no other exposures to FC. Entity A does not manage foreign currency risk on a net basis. Hence, Entity A cannot apply hedge accounting for a hedging relationship between the foreign currency derivative and a net position of FC100 (consisting of FC150,000 of the firm purchase commitment&#x2014;ie advertising services&#x2014;and FC149,900 (of the FC150,000) of the firm sale commitment) for a nine-month period.</p></body></paragraph>
