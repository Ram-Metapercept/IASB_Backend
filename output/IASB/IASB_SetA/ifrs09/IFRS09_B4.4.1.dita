Such changes are expected to be very infrequent.  Such changes are determined by the entity&#x2019;s senior management as a result of external or internal changes and must be significant to the entity&#x2019;s operations and demonstrable to external parties. Accordingly, a change in an entity&#x2019;s business model will occur only when an entity either begins or ceases to perform an activity that is significant to its operations; for example, when the entity has acquired, disposed of or terminated a business line. Examples of a change in business model include the following:</p><ol id="IFRS09_L0121" base="F32626111" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P1250" base="F32626222">An entity has a portfolio of commercial loans that it holds to sell in the short term. The entity acquires a company that manages commercial loans and has a business model that holds the loans in order to collect the contractual cash flows. The portfolio of commercial loans is no longer for sale, and the portfolio is now managed together with the acquired commercial loans and all are held to collect the contractual cash flows.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P1251" base="F32626224">A financial services firm decides to shut down its retail mortgage business.
