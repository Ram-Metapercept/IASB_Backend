An entity shall assess whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition on the basis of all reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort. This includes historical and forward-looking information and an assessment of the credit risk over the expected life of the financial asset, which includes information about the circumstances that led to the modification. Evidence that the criteria for the recognition of <xref base="F32570722" href="IFRS09_APPA.dita#IFRS09_APPA/IFRS09_P0724">lifetime expected credit losses<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0230"/></ph></xref> are no longer met may include a history of up&#x2011;to&#x2011;date and timely payment performance against the modified contractual terms. Typically a customer would need to demonstrate consistently good payment behaviour over a period of time before the credit risk is considered to have decreased. For example, a history of missed or incomplete payments would not typically be erased by simply making one payment on time following a modification of the contractual terms.</p></body></paragraph>
