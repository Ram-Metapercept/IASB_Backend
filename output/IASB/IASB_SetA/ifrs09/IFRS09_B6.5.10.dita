If the exchange rate between Foreign Currency A and Foreign Currency B were changed (ie a new band or rate was set), rebalancing the hedging relationship to reflect the new exchange rate would ensure that the hedging relationship would continue to meet the hedge effectiveness requirement for the <xref base="F32570701" href="IFRS09_APPA.dita#IFRS09_APPA/IFRS09_P0715">hedge ratio<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0165"/></ph></xref> in the new circumstances. In contrast, if there was a default on the currency derivative, changing the hedge ratio could not ensure that the hedging relationship would continue to meet that hedge effectiveness requirement. Hence, rebalancing does not facilitate the continuation of a hedging relationship in situations in which the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item changes in a way that cannot be compensated for by adjusting the hedge ratio.</p></body></paragraph>
