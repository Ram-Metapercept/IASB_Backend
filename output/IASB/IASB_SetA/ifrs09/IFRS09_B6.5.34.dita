However, the relevant aspect for the purpose of assessing whether a hedging instrument hedges a transaction or time-period related hedged item are the characteristics of that hedged item, including how and when it affects profit or loss. Hence, an entity shall assess the type of hedged item (see <xref id="IFRS09_X1613" base="F42162242" href="IFRS09_g6.5.16-6.5.16.dita#IFRS09_g6.5.16-6.5.16/IFRS09_g6.5.16-6.5.16_TI">paragraphs 6.5.16</xref> and <xref id="IFRS09_X1614" base="F42162243" href="IFRS09_g6.5.15-6.5.15.dita#IFRS09_g6.5.15-6.5.15/IFRS09_g6.5.15-6.5.15_TI">6.5.15(a)</xref>) on the basis of the nature of the hedged item (regardless of whether the hedging relationship is a cash flow hedge or a fair value hedge):</p><ol id="IFRS09_L0166" base="SL32626971" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P1665" base="SL32626973">the forward element of a forward contract relates to a transaction related hedged item if the nature of the hedged item is a transaction for which the forward element has the character of costs of that transaction. An example is when the forward element relates to a hedged item that results in the recognition of an item whose initial measurement includes <xref base="F32570761" href="IFRS09_APPA.dita#IFRS09_APPA/IFRS09_P0740">transaction costs<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0369"/></ph></xref> (for example, an entity hedges an inventory purchase denominated in a foreign currency, whether it is a forecast transaction or a firm commitment, against foreign currency risk and includes the transaction costs in the initial measurement of the inventory). As a consequence of including the forward element in the initial measurement of the particular hedged item, the forward element affects profit or loss at the same time as that hedged item. Similarly, an entity that hedges a sale of a commodity denominated in a foreign currency against foreign currency risk, whether it is a <xref base="F32570691" href="IFRS09_APPA.dita#IFRS09_APPA/IFRS09_P0711">forecast transaction<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0138"/></ph></xref> or a <xref base="F32570687" href="IFRS09_APPA.dita#IFRS09_APPA/IFRS09_P0709">firm commitment<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0131"/></ph></xref>, would include the forward element as part of the cost that is related to that sale (hence, the forward element would be recognised in profit or loss in the same period as the revenue from the hedged sale).</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P1666" base="SL32626975">the forward element of a forward contract relates to a time-period related hedged item if the nature of the hedged item is such that the forward element has the character of a cost for obtaining protection against a risk over a particular period of time (but the hedged item does not result in a transaction that involves the notion of a transaction cost in accordance with (a)). For example, if commodity inventory is hedged against changes in fair value for six months using a commodity forward contract with a corresponding life, the forward element of the forward contract would be allocated to profit or loss (ie amortised on a systematic and rational basis) over that six-month period. Another example is a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation that is hedged for 18 months using a foreign-exchange forward contract, which would result in allocating the forward element of the forward contract over that 18-month period.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
