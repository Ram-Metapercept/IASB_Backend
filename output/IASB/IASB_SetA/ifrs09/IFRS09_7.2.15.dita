The entity may restate prior periods if, and only if, it is possible without the use of hindsight. If an entity does not restate prior periods, the entity shall recognise any difference between the previous carrying amount and the carrying amount at the beginning of the annual reporting period that includes the date of initial application in the opening retained earnings (or other component of equity, as appropriate) of the annual reporting period that includes the date of initial application. However, if an entity restates prior periods, the restated financial statements must reflect all of the requirements in this Standard. If an entity&#x2019;s chosen approach to applying IFRS 9 results in more than one date of initial application for different requirements, this paragraph applies at each date of initial application (see <xref id="IFRS09_X0881" base="F68597279" href="IFRS09_7.2.2.dita#IFRS09_7.2.2">paragraph 7.2.2</xref>). This would be the case, for example, if an entity elects to early apply only the requirements for the presentation of gains and losses on financial liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with <xref id="IFRS09_X0882" base="F68597280" href="IFRS09_7.1.2.dita#IFRS09_7.1.2">paragraph 7.1.2</xref> before applying the other requirements in this Standard.</p></body></paragraph>
