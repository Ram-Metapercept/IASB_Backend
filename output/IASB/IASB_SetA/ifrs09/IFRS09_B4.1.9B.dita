That would be the case, for example, if a financial asset&#x2019;s interest rate is periodically reset but the frequency of that reset does not match the tenor of the interest rate (for example, the interest rate resets every month to a one&#x2011;year rate) or if a financial asset&#x2019;s interest rate is periodically reset to an average of particular short&#x2011; and long&#x2011;term interest rates. In such cases, an entity must assess the modification to determine whether the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. In some circumstances, the entity may be able to make that determination by performing a qualitative assessment of the time value of money element whereas, in other circumstances, it may be necessary to perform a quantitative assessment.</p></body></paragraph>
