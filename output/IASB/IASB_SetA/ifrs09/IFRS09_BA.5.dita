These include an index of earthquake losses in a particular region and an index of temperatures in a particular city. Non&#x2011;financial variables specific to a party to the contract include the occurrence or non&#x2011;occurrence of a fire that damages or destroys an asset of a party to the contract. A change in the fair value of a non&#x2011;financial asset is specific to the owner if the fair value reflects not only changes in market prices for such assets (a financial variable) but also the condition of the specific non&#x2011;financial asset held (a non&#x2011;financial variable). For example, if a guarantee of the residual value of a specific car exposes the guarantor to the risk of changes in the car&#x2019;s physical condition, the change in that residual value is specific to the owner of the car.</p></body></paragraph>
