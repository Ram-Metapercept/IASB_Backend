The lack of such a mechanism is an indicator that the rights may not be substantive. The more parties that are required to agree to exercise the rights, the less likely it is that those rights are substantive. However, a board of directors whose members are independent of the <xref base="F16125801" href="IFRS10_APPA.dita#IFRS10_APPA/IFRS10_P0163">decision maker<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0072"/></ph></xref> may serve as a mechanism for numerous investors to act collectively in exercising their rights. Therefore, removal rights exercisable by an independent board of directors are more likely to be substantive than if the same rights were exercisable individually by a large number of investors. </p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS10_P0285" base="F16126676">Whether the party or parties that hold the rights would benefit from the exercise of those rights.

The terms and conditions of potential voting rights are more likely to be substantive when the instrument is in the money or the investor would benefit for other reasons (eg by realising synergies between the investor and the investee) from the exercise or conversion of the instrument.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
