For example, when an entity corrects a prior period error in calculating its liability for employees&#x2019; accumulated sick leave in accordance with <xref id="IAS08_X0188" base="F33247912" href="../IAS19.ditamap"><ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 19</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Employee Benefits</ph></ph></xref>, it disregards information about an unusually severe influenza season during the next period that became available after the financial statements for the prior period were authorised for issue.  The fact that significant estimates are frequently required when amending comparative information  presented for prior periods does not prevent reliable adjustment or correction of the comparative information.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
