Estimation is inherently subjective, and estimates may be developed after the reporting period. Developing estimates is potentially more difficult when retrospectively applying an accounting policy or making a <xref base="SL141416" href="IAS08_5.dita#IAS08_5/IAS08_P0027">retrospective restatement<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0339"/></ph></xref> to correct a <xref base="SL141408" href="IAS08_5.dita#IAS08_5/IAS08_P0022">prior period error<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0301"/></ph></xref>, because of the longer period of time that might have passed since the affected transaction, other event or condition occurred. However, the objective of estimates related to prior periods remains the same as for estimates made in the current period, namely, for the estimate to reflect the circumstances that existed when the transaction, other event or condition occurred.</p></body></paragraph>
