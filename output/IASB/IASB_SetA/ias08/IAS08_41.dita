Financial statements do not comply with IFRSs if they contain either material errors or immaterial errors made intentionally to achieve a particular presentation of an entity&#x2019;s financial position,              financial performance              or cash flows. Potential current period errors discovered in that period are corrected before the financial statements are authorised for issue. However, material errors are sometimes not discovered until a subsequent period, and these prior period errors are corrected in the comparative information              presented in the financial statements for that subsequent period (see <xref base="F16378908" href="IAS08_42.dita#IAS08_42" id="IAS08_X0166">paragraphs 42&#x2013;47</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
