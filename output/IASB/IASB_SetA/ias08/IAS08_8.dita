Those policies need not be applied when the effect of applying them is immaterial. However, it is inappropriate to make, or leave uncorrected, immaterial departures from IFRSs to achieve a particular presentation of an entity&#x2019;s financial position, financial performance or cash flows.</p></body></paragraph>
