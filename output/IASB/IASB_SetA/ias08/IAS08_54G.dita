A regulatory account balance is the balance of any expense (or income) account that is not recognised as an asset or a liability in accordance with other applicable IFRS Standards but is included, or is expected to be included, by the rate regulator in establishing the rate(s) that can be charged to customers. A rate regulator is an authorised body that is empowered by statute or regulation to establish the rate or a range of rates that bind an entity. The rate regulator may be a third-party body or a related party of the entity, including the entity&#x2019;s own governing board, if that body is required by statute or regulation to set rates both in the interest of the customers and to ensure the overall financial viability of the entity.</p>            </variant></body></paragraph>
