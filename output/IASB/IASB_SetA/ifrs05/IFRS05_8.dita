Further, the asset (or disposal group) must be actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value. In addition, the sale should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification, except as permitted by <xref id="IFRS05_X0116" base="F4-73" href="IFRS05_9.dita#IFRS05_9">paragraph 9</xref>, and actions required to complete the plan should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. The probability of shareholders&#x2019; approval (if required in the jurisdiction) should be considered as part of the assessment of whether the sale is highly probable.</p></body></paragraph>
