A risk adjustment may increase the amount at which a <xref base="SL145941" href="IAS37_10.dita#IAS37_10/IAS37_P0057_V1">liability<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0226"/></ph></xref> is measured. Caution is needed in making judgements under conditions of uncertainty, so that income or assets are not overstated and expenses or liabilities are not understated. However, uncertainty does not justify the creation of excessive <xref base="SL145940" href="IAS37_10.dita#IAS37_10/IAS37_P0056">provisions<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0307"/></ph></xref> or a deliberate overstatement of liabilities. For example, if the projected costs of a particularly adverse outcome are estimated on a prudent basis, that outcome is not then deliberately treated as more probable than is realistically the case. Care is needed to avoid duplicating adjustments for risk and uncertainty with consequent overstatement of a provision.</p></body></paragraph>
