However, even in such a case, the entity considers other possible outcomes. Where other possible outcomes are either mostly higher or mostly lower than the most likely outcome, the best estimate will be a higher or lower amount. For example, if an entity has to rectify a serious fault in a major plant that it has constructed for a customer, the individual most likely outcome may be for the repair to succeed at the first attempt at a cost of 1,000, but a <xref base="SL145940" href="IAS37_10.dita#IAS37_10/IAS37_P0056">provision<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0307"/></ph></xref> for a larger amount is made if there is a significant chance that further attempts will be necessary.</p></body></paragraph>
