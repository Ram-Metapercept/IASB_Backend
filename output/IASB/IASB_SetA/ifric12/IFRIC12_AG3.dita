However, the condition shall be applied to the substance of the agreement. Non&#x2011;substantive features, such as a cap that will apply only in remote circumstances, shall be ignored. Conversely, if for example, a contract purports to give the operator freedom to set prices, but any excess profit is returned to the grantor, the operator&#x2019;s return is capped and the price element of the control test is met.</p></body></paragraph>
