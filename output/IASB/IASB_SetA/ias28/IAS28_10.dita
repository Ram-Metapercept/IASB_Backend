The investor&#x2019;s share of the investee&#x2019;s profit or loss is recognised in the investor&#x2019;s profit or loss. Distributions received from an investee reduce the carrying amount of the investment. Adjustments to the carrying amount may also be necessary for changes in the investor&#x2019;s proportionate interest in the investee arising from changes in the investee&#x2019;s other comprehensive income. Such changes include those arising from the revaluation of property, plant and equipment              and from foreign exchange translation differences. The investor&#x2019;s share of those changes is recognised in the investor&#x2019;s other comprehensive income (see IAS 1 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Presentation of Financial Statements</ph></ph>).</p></body></paragraph>
