Instead, the entire carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 as a single asset, by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal) with its carrying amount whenever application of paragraphs 41A&#x2013;41C indicates that the net investment may be impaired. An impairment loss recognised in those circumstances is not allocated to any asset, including goodwill, that forms part of the carrying amount of the net investment in the associate or joint venture.                  Accordingly, any reversal of that impairment loss is recognised in accordance with IAS 36 to the extent that the recoverable amount of the net investment subsequently increases.                  In determining the value in use of the net investment, an entity estimates:</p>       <ol id="IAS28_L0010" base="F36676997" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>           <p id="IAS28_P0152" base="F36676999">its share of the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the associate or joint venture, including the cash flows from the operations of the associate or joint venture and the proceeds from the ultimate disposal of the investment; or</p>         </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>           <p id="IAS28_P0153" base="F36677003">the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from dividends to be received from the investment and from its ultimate disposal.</p>         </li></ol>       <p id="IAS28_P0154" base="F36677004">Using appropriate assumptions, both methods give the same result.</p>     </variant></body></paragraph>
