This test might be required because the CGU contains goodwill,              or because one or more of the impairment indicators described in IAS 36              have been identified relating to the CGU. In such situations, <xref base="F33214859" href="../ias36/IAS36_74.dita#IAS36_74" id="IFRS14_X0200">paragraphs 74&#x2013;79 of IAS 36</xref> contain requirements for identifying the recoverable amount and the carrying amount of a CGU. An entity shall apply those requirements to decide whether any of the regulatory deferral account balances recognised are included in the carrying amount of the CGU for the purpose of the impairment test. The remaining requirements of IAS 36 shall then be applied to any impairment loss that is recognised as a result of this test.</p></body></paragraph>
