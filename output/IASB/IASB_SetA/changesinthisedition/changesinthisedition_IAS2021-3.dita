The amendments narrowed the scope       of the recognition exemption in paragraphs 15 and 24 of IAS 12 so that it no longer applies to       transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary       differences. The amendments apply to transactions such as leases and decommissioning       obligations.</p></body></topic>
