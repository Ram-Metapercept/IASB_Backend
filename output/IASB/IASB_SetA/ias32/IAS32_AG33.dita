The method used in allocating the consideration paid and transaction costs to the separate components is consistent with that used in the original allocation to the separate components of the proceeds received by the entity when the convertible instrument was issued, in accordance with <xref id="IAS32_X0690" base="F958052" href="IAS32_28.dita#IAS32_28">paragraphs 28&#x2013;32</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
