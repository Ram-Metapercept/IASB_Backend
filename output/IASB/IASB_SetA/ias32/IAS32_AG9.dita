The lessor accounts for its investment in the amount receivable under a finance lease rather than the underlying asset itself that is subject to the finance lease. Accordingly, a lessor regards a finance lease as a financial instrument. Under <xref base="F46976816" href="../ifrs16/IFRS16_TOC.dita#IFRS16_TOC0001" id="IAS32_X0542">IFRS 16</xref>, a lessor does not recognise its entitlement to receive lease payments under an operating lease.  The lessor continues to account for the underlying asset itself rather than any amount receivable in the future under the contract. Accordingly, a lessor does not regard an operating lease as a financial instrument, except as regards individual payments currently due and payable by the lessee.</p>  </variant></body></paragraph>
