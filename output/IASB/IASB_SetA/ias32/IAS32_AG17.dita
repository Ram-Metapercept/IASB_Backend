Conversely, the writer of an option assumes an obligation to forgo potential future economic benefits or bear potential losses of economic benefits associated with changes in the fair value of the underlying financial instrument. The contractual right of the holder and obligation of the writer meet the definition of a financial asset and a financial liability, respectively. The financial instrument underlying an option contract may be any financial asset, including shares in other entities and interest&#x2011;bearing instruments. An option may require the writer to issue a debt instrument, rather than transfer a financial asset, but the instrument underlying the option would constitute a financial asset of the holder if the option were exercised. The option&#x2011;holder&#x2019;s right to exchange the financial asset under potentially favourable conditions and the writer&#x2019;s obligation to exchange the financial asset under potentially unfavourable conditions are distinct from the underlying financial asset to be exchanged upon exercise of the option. The nature of the holder&#x2019;s right and of the writer&#x2019;s obligation are not affected by the likelihood that the option will be exercised.</p><variants id="IAS32_E0088">                   </variants></body></paragraph>
