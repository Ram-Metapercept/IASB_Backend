If the liability component is no longer outstanding, a retrospective application of those amendments to <xref base="F16453176" href="IAS32_TOC.dita#IAS32_TOC0001" id="IAS32_X0487">IAS 32</xref> would involve separating two components of equity. The first component would be in retained earnings and represent the cumulative interest accreted on the liability component. The other component would represent the original equity component. Therefore, an entity need not separate these two components if the liability component is no longer outstanding at the date of application of the amendments.</p></body></paragraph>
