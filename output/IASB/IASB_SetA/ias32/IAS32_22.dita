For example, an issued share option that gives the counterparty a right to buy a fixed number of the entity&#x2019;s shares for a fixed price or for a fixed stated principal amount of a bond is an equity instrument.

Any consideration received (such as the premium received for a written option or warrant on the entity&#x2019;s own shares) is added directly to equity. Any consideration paid (such as the premium paid for a purchased option) is deducted directly from equity. Changes in the fair value of an equity instrument are not recognised in the financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
