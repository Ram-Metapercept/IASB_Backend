In these circumstances the cash flows are, in effect, equivalent to a single net amount and there is no exposure to <xref base="SL144807" href="../ifrs07/IFRS07_APPA.dita#IFRS07_APPA/IFRS07_P0862">credit<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0064"/></ph></xref> or <xref base="SL144816" href="../ifrs07/IFRS07_APPA.dita#IFRS07_APPA/IFRS07_P0866">liquidity risk<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0231"/></ph></xref>. In other circumstances, an entity may settle two instruments by receiving and paying separate amounts, becoming exposed to credit risk for the full amount of the asset or liquidity risk for the full amount of the liability. Such risk exposures may be significant even though relatively brief. Accordingly, realisation of a <xref base="SL37522973" href="IAS32_11.dita#IAS32_11/IAS32_P0115">financial asset<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0123"/></ph></xref> and settlement of a <xref base="SL37523036" href="IAS32_11.dita#IAS32_11/IAS32_P0131">financial liability<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0127"/></ph></xref> are treated as simultaneous only when the transactions occur at the same moment.</p></body></paragraph>
