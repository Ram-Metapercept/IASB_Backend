An entity may have a contractual right or obligation to receive or deliver a number of its own shares or other equity instruments that varies so that the <xref base="SL37523131" href="IAS32_11.dita#IAS32_11/IAS32_P0152">fair value<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0118"/></ph></xref> of the entity&#x2019;s own equity instruments to be received or delivered equals the amount of the contractual right or obligation. Such a contractual right or obligation may be for a fixed amount or an amount that fluctuates in part or in full in response to changes in a variable other than the market price of the entity&#x2019;s own equity instruments (eg an interest rate, a commodity price or a <xref base="SL37522960" href="IAS32_11.dita#IAS32_11/IAS32_P0110">financial instrument<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0126"/></ph></xref> price). Two examples are (a) a contract to deliver as many of the entity&#x2019;s own equity instruments as are equal in value to CU100,<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS32_FN0017" type="fn"/> and (b) a contract to deliver as many of the entity&#x2019;s own equity instruments as are equal in value to the value of 100 ounces of gold. Such a contract is a <xref base="SL37523036" href="IAS32_11.dita#IAS32_11/IAS32_P0131">financial liability<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0127"/></ph></xref> of the entity even though the entity must or can settle it by delivering its own equity instruments. It is not an equity instrument because the entity uses a variable number of its own equity instruments as a means to settle the contract. Accordingly, the contract does not evidence a residual interest in the entity&#x2019;s assets after deducting all of its liabilities.</p></body></paragraph>
