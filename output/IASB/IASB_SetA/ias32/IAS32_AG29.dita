When classifying a financial instrument (or a component of it) in consolidated financial statements, an entity considers all terms and conditions agreed between members of the group and the holders of the instrument in determining whether the group as a whole has an obligation to deliver cash or another <xref base="SL37522973" href="IAS32_11.dita#IAS32_11/IAS32_P0115">financial asset<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0123"/></ph></xref> in respect of the instrument or to settle it in a manner that results in liability classification. When a subsidiary in a group issues a <xref base="SL37522960" href="IAS32_11.dita#IAS32_11/IAS32_P0110">financial instrument<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0126"/></ph></xref> and a parent or other group entity agrees additional terms directly with the holders of the instrument (eg a guarantee), the group may not have discretion over distributions or redemption. Although the subsidiary may appropriately classify the instrument without regard to these additional terms in its individual financial statements, the effect of other agreements between members of the group and the holders of the instrument is considered in order to ensure that consolidated financial statements reflect the contracts and transactions entered into by the group as a whole. To the extent that there is such an obligation or settlement provision, the instrument (or the component of it that is subject to the obligation) is classified as a <xref base="SL37523036" href="IAS32_11.dita#IAS32_11/IAS32_P0131">financial liability<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0127"/></ph></xref> in consolidated financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
