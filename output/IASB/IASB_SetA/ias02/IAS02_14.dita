This is the case, for example, when joint products are produced or when there is a main product and a by&#x2011;product. When the costs of conversion of each product are not separately identifiable, they are allocated between the products on a rational and consistent basis. The allocation may be based, for example, on the relative sales value of each product either at the stage in the production process when the products become separately identifiable, or at the completion of production. Most by&#x2011;products, by their nature, are immaterial. When this is the case, they are often measured at <xref base="SL140690" href="IAS02_6.dita#IAS02_6/IAS02_P0026">net realisable value<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0257"/></ph></xref> and this value is deducted from the cost of the main product. As a result, the carrying amount of the main product is not materially different from its cost.</p></body></paragraph>
