Specifically, the transaction is one in which a bank borrows gold from a third party           (Contract 1) and then lends that gold to a different third party for the same term and for           a higher fee (Contract 2). The bank enters into the two contracts in contemplation of each           other, but the contracts are not linked&#x2014;ie the bank negotiates the contracts independently           of each other. In each contract, the borrower obtains legal title to the gold at inception           and has an obligation to return, at the end of the contract, gold of the same quality and           quantity as that received. In exchange for the loan of gold, each borrower pays a fee to           the respective lender over the term of the contract but there are no cash flows at           inception of the contract.</p>         <p outputclass="keep_with_next">The Committee was asked whether, for the term of the two           contracts, the bank that borrows and then lends the gold recognises:</p>         <ol type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>a.</li_value>             <p id="IAS02_P0130">an asset representing the gold (or the right to receive gold);               and</p>           </li><li><li_value>b.</li_value>             <p id="IAS02_P0131">a liability representing the obligation to deliver gold.</p>           </li></ol>         <p outputclass="keep_with_next" id="IAS02_P0132">The Committee observed that the particular           transaction in the submission might not be clearly captured within the scope of any IFRS           Standard. [<i>The Committee observed, however, that particular IFRS Standards would apply             to other transactions involving commodities (for example, the purchase of commodities             for use in an entity&#x2019;s production process, or the sale of commodities to           customers).</i>] In the absence of a Standard that specifically applies to a transaction,           an entity applies paragraphs 10 and 11 of IAS 8 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and               Errors</ph></ph> in developing and applying an accounting policy to the transaction.

The Committee observed that, in considering the requirements that deal with           similar and related issues, an entity considers all the requirements dealing with those           similar and related issues, including relevant disclosure requirements.</p>         <p>The Committee also observed that the requirements in paragraph 112(c) of IAS 1 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Presentation of Financial               Statements</ph></ph> are relevant if an entity develops an accounting policy applying           paragraphs 10 and 11 of IAS 8 for a commodity loan transaction such as that described in           the submission. In applying these requirements, an entity considers whether additional           disclosures are needed to provide information relevant to an understanding of the           accounting for, and risks associated with, such commodity loan transactions.</p>         <p>The Committee concluded that it would be unable to resolve the question asked efficiently           within the confines of existing IFRS Standards. The wide range of transactions involving           commodities means that any narrow-scope standard-setting activity would be of limited           benefit to entities and would have a high risk of unintended consequences. Consequently,           the Committee decided not to add this matter to its standard-setting agenda.]</p>       </fn> <fn base="IAS02_6" id="EDUFN-ad2019-june-ap12_IAS38">                  <p>The Committee discussed how IFRS Standards apply to holdings of cryptocurrencies.</p>         <p outputclass="keep_with_next">The Committee noted that a range of cryptoassets exist.

If IAS 2 is not applicable, an entity applies IAS 38 to           holdings of cryptocurrencies.

In summary, a financial asset is any           asset that is: (a) cash; (b) an equity instrument of another entity; (c) a contractual           right to receive cash or another financial asset from another entity; (d) a contractual           right to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under           particular conditions; or (e) a particular contract that will or may be settled in the           entity&#x2019;s own equity instruments.</p>         <p>The Committee concluded that a holding of cryptocurrency is not a financial asset. This           is because a cryptocurrency is not cash (see below). Nor is it an equity instrument of           another entity. It does not give rise to a contractual right for the holder and it is not           a contract that will or may be settled in the holder&#x2019;s own equity instruments.</p>         <p outputclass="keep_with_next"><i>Cash</i></p>         <p>Paragraph AG3 of IAS 32 states that &#x2018;currency (cash) is a financial asset because it           represents the medium of exchange and is therefore the basis on which all transactions are           measured and recognised in financial statements. A deposit of cash with a bank or similar           financial institution is a financial asset because it represents the contractual right of           the depositor to obtain cash from the institution or to draw a cheque or similar           instrument against the balance in favour of a creditor in payment of a financial           liability&#x2019;. </p>         <p>The Committee observed that the description of cash in paragraph AG3 of IAS 32 implies           that cash is expected to be used as a medium of exchange (ie used in exchange for goods or           services) and as the monetary unit in pricing goods or services to such an extent that it           would be the basis on which all transactions are measured and recognised in financial           statements. </p>         <p>Some cryptocurrencies can be used in exchange for particular good or services. However,           the Committee noted that it is not aware of any cryptocurrency that is used as a medium of           exchange and as the monetary unit in pricing goods or services to such an extent that it           would be the basis on which all transactions are measured and recognised in financial           statements. Consequently, the Committee concluded that a holding of cryptocurrency is not           cash because cryptocurrencies do not currently have the characteristics of cash.</p>         <p outputclass="keep_with_next" typeface="sansserif">Inventory</p>         <p outputclass="keep_with_next">IAS 2 applies to inventories of intangible assets. Paragraph           6 of that Standard defines inventories as assets:</p>         <ol><li><li_value>a.</li_value>             <p>held for sale in the ordinary course of business;</p>           </li><li><li_value>b.</li_value>             <p>in the process of production for such sale; or</p>           </li><li><li_value>c.</li_value>             <p>in the form of materials or supplies to be consumed in the production process or in               the rendering of services.</p>           </li></ol>         <p>The Committee observed that an entity may hold cryptocurrencies for sale in the ordinary           course of business. In that circumstance, a holding of cryptocurrency is inventory for the           entity and, accordingly, IAS 2 applies to that holding.</p>         <p>The Committee also observed that an entity may act as a broker-trader of           cryptocurrencies. In that circumstance, the entity considers the requirements in paragraph           3(b) of IAS 2 for commodity broker-traders who measure their inventories at fair value           less costs to sell. Paragraph 5 of IAS 2 states that broker-traders are those who buy or           sell commodities for others or on their own account. The inventories referred to in           paragraph 3(b) are principally acquired with the purpose of selling in the near future and           generating a profit from fluctuations in price or broker-traders&#x2019; margin.</p>         <p outputclass="keep_with_next" typeface="sansserif">Disclosure</p>         <p outputclass="keep_with_next">In addition to disclosures otherwise required by IFRS           Standards, an entity is required to disclose any additional information that is relevant           to an understanding of its financial statements (paragraph 112 of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 1</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Presentation of Financial Statements</ph></ph>).

For example, an entity holding cryptocurrencies would consider whether changes               in the fair value of those holdings after the reporting period are of such               significance that non-disclosure could influence the economic decisions that users of               financial statements make on the basis of the financial statements.]</p>           </li></ol>       </fn> <fn base="IAS02_6" id="IAS02_FN0002">         <p outputclass="keep_with_next" id="IAS02_P0136">[IFRIC® <i>Update</i>, November 2014,           Agenda Decision, &#x2018;IAS 16 <i>Property, Plant and Equipment</i> and           IAS 2 <i>Inventories</i>&#x2014;Accounting for core inventories&#x2019;</p>         <p outputclass="keep_with_next">The Interpretations Committee received a request to clarify           the accounting for &#x2018;core inventories&#x2019;.

The question considered is whether the purchaser           should accrete interest on long-term prepayments by recognising interest income, resulting           in an increase in the cost of inventories and, ultimately, the cost of sales.</p>         <p>The Interpretations Committee discussed this issue and noted that paragraph 18 of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 2</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Inventories</ph></ph> requires that when an entity           purchases inventories on deferred settlement terms, and the arrangement contains a           financing element, the difference between the purchase price on normal credit terms and           the amount paid is recognised separately as interest expense over the period of the           financing. It also noted that <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 16</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Property,               Plant and Equipment</ph></ph> and <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 38</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Intangible               Assets</ph></ph> include similar requirements when payment for an asset is             deferred. <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 15</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Revenue from Contracts with               Customers,</ph></ph> issued in May 2014, additionally includes the requirement that           the financing component of a transaction should be recognised separately in circumstances           of both prepayment and deferral of payment.</p>         <p outputclass="keep_with_next">The Interpretations Committee conducted outreach on this           issue, but the outreach returned very limited results. In the absence of evidence about           this issue, and of a broader range of information about the facts and circumstances           relating to these transactions, the Interpretations Committee thought it would be           difficult for it to address this topic efficiently and effectively. The Interpretations           Committee observed, however, that when a financing component is identified in a long-term           supply contract, that financing component should be accounted for separately. The           Interpretations Committee acknowledged that judgement is required to identify when           individual arrangements contain a financing component.</p>         <p>The Interpretations Committee concluded that this issue did not meet its agenda criteria           and therefore it decided to remove this issue from its agenda.]</p>       </fn><fn base="IAS02_g28-33" id="IAS02_FN0006">         <p outputclass="keep_with_next" id="IAS02_P0144">[IFRIC® <i>Update</i>, March           2004, &#x2018;Consumption of inventories by a service organisation&#x2019;</p>         <p>The issue related to the consumption of inventories by a service entity, in particular           the assessment of net realisable value when the inventory is consumed as part of the           service rendered.</p>         <p>The IFRIC noted that the same issues existed for commercial entities.
