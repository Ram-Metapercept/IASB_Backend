Normal capacity is the production expected to be achieved on average over a number of periods or seasons under normal circumstances, taking into account the loss of capacity resulting from planned maintenance. The actual level of production may be used if it approximates normal capacity. The amount of fixed overhead allocated to each unit of production is not increased as a consequence of low production or idle plant. Unallocated overheads are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. In periods of abnormally high production, the amount of fixed overhead allocated to each unit of production is decreased so that <xref base="SL140682" href="IAS02_6.dita#IAS02_6/IAS02_P0022">inventories<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0201"/></ph></xref> are not measured above cost. Variable production overheads are allocated to each unit of production on the basis of the actual use of the production facilities.</p></body></paragraph>
