For example, the net realisable value of the quantity of inventory held to satisfy firm sales or service contracts is based on the contract price. If the sales contracts are for less than the inventory quantities held, the net realisable value of the excess is based on general selling prices.

Such provisions are dealt with under <xref base="F231643" href="../ias37/IAS37_TOC.dita#IAS37_TOC" scope="local" id="IAS02_X0057">IAS 37 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets</ph></ph></xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
