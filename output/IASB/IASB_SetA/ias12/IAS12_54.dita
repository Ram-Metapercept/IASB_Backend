In many cases such scheduling is impracticable or highly complex. Therefore, it is inappropriate to require discounting of deferred tax assets and liabilities. To permit, but not to require, discounting would result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which would not be comparable between entities.                     Therefore, this Standard does not require or permit the discounting of deferred tax assets and liabilities.</p></body></paragraph>
