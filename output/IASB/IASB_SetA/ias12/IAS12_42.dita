Therefore, in the absence of an agreement requiring that the profits of the associate will not be distributed in the foreseeable future, an investor recognises a <xref base="SL143756" href="IAS12_5.dita#IAS12_5/IAS12_P0021">deferred tax liability<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0076"/></ph></xref> arising from <xref base="SL143765" href="IAS12_5.dita#IAS12_5/IAS12_P0026">taxable temporary differences<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0365"/></ph></xref> associated with its investment in the associate. In some cases, an investor may not be able to determine the amount of tax that would be payable if it recovers the cost of its investment in an associate, but can determine that it will equal or exceed a minimum amount. In such cases, the deferred tax liability is measured at this amount.</p></body></paragraph>
