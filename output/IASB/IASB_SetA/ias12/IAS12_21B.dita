For example, if in a business combination an entity recognises goodwill of CU100 that is deductible for tax purposes at a rate of 20 per cent per year starting in the year of acquisition, the <xref base="SL143771" href="IAS12_5.dita#IAS12_5/IAS12_P0033">tax base<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0361"/></ph></xref> of the goodwill is CU100 on initial recognition and CU80 at the end of the year of acquisition. If the carrying amount of goodwill at the end of the year of acquisition remains unchanged at CU100, a taxable temporary difference of CU20 arises at the end of that year. Because that taxable temporary difference does not relate to the initial recognition of the goodwill, the resulting deferred tax liability is recognised.</p></body></paragraph>
