However, almost the same effect on profit or loss of hedge accounting for this type of hedging relationship can be achieved by designating as the hedged item part of the underlying items. For example, if a bank has CU100 of assets and CU90 of liabilities with risks and terms of a similar nature and hedges the net CU10 exposure, it can designate as the hedged item CU10 of those assets. This designation can be used if such assets and liabilities are fixed rate instruments, in which case it is a fair value hedge, or if they are variable rate instruments, in which case it is a cash flow hedge. Similarly, if an entity has a <xref base="SL134655" href="IAS39_9_hedge-accounting.dita#IAS39_9_hedge-accounting/IAS39_P0208" scope="local">firm commitment<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0131"/></ph></xref> to make a purchase in a foreign currency of CU100 and a firm commitment to make a sale in the foreign currency of CU90, it can hedge the net amount of CU10 by acquiring a derivative and designating it as a <xref base="SL134657" href="IAS39_9_hedge-accounting.dita#IAS39_9_hedge-accounting/IAS39_P0210" scope="local">hedging instrument<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0167"/></ph></xref> associated with CU10 of the firm purchase commitment of CU100.</p></body></paragraph>
