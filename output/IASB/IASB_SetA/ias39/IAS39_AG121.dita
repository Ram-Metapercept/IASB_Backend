For prepayable items, paragraph 81A permits this to be achieved by designating the <xref base="SL134658" href="IAS39_9_hedge-accounting.dita#IAS39_9_hedge-accounting/IAS39_P0211">hedged item<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0166"/></ph></xref> in terms of the change in the fair value that is attributable to changes in the designated interest rate on the basis of <i>expected</i>, rather than <i>contractual</i>, repricing dates. However, the effect that changes in the hedged interest rate have on those expected repricing dates shall be included when determining the change in the fair value of the hedged item. Consequently, if the expected repricing dates are revised (eg to reflect a change in expected prepayments), or if actual repricing dates differ from those expected, ineffectiveness will arise as described in <xref base="F16151458" href="IAS39_AG126.dita#IAS39_AG126" id="IAS39_X1041">paragraph AG126</xref>. Conversely, changes in expected repricing dates that (a) clearly arise from factors other than changes in the hedged interest rate, (b) are uncorrelated with changes in the hedged interest rate and (c) can be reliably separated from changes that are attributable to the hedged interest rate (eg changes in prepayment rates clearly arising from a change in demographic factors or tax regulations rather than changes in interest rate) are excluded when determining the change in the fair value of the hedged item, because they are not attributable to the hedged risk. If there is uncertainty about the factor that gave rise to the change in expected repricing dates or the entity is not able to separate reliably the changes that arise from the hedged interest rate from those that arise from other factors, the change is assumed to arise from changes in the hedged interest rate.</p></body></paragraph>
