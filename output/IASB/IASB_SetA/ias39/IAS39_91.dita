For this purpose, the replacement or rollover of a hedging instrument into             another hedging instrument is not an expiration or termination if such replacement or             rollover is part of the entity&#x2019;s documented hedging strategy.

For this purpose, a clearing                 counterparty is a central counterparty (sometimes called a &#x2018;clearing organisation&#x2019;                 or &#x2018;clearing agency&#x2019;) or an entity or entities, for example, a clearing member of a                 clearing organisation or a client of a clearing member of a clearing organisation,                 that are acting as counterparty in order to effect clearing by a central                 counterparty. However, when the parties to the hedging instrument replace their                 original counterparties with different counterparties this paragraph shall apply                 only if each of those parties effects clearing with the same central                 counterparty.</p>                            </li><li><li_value>(ii)</li_value>               <p base="F24159600" id="IAS39_P0603">other changes, if any, to the hedging instrument                 are limited to those that are necessary to effect such a replacement of the                 counterparty.
