Despite this requirement an entity is permitted to designate, at the date of transition to IFRSs, contracts that already exist on that date as measured at fair value through profit or loss but only if they meet the requirements of paragraph 2.5 of IFRS 9 at that date and the entity designates all similar contracts.</p></body></paragraph>
