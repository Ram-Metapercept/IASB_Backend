For an investment to qualify as a cash equivalent it must be readily convertible to a known amount of <xref base="SL131363" href="IAS07_6.dita#IAS07_6/IAS07_P0014">cash<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0028"/></ph></xref> and be subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Therefore, an investment normally qualifies as a cash equivalent only when it has a short maturity of, say, three months or less from the date of acquisition. Equity investments are excluded from cash equivalents unless they are, in substance, cash equivalents, for example in the case of preferred shares acquired within a short period of their maturity and with a specified redemption date.</p></body></paragraph>
