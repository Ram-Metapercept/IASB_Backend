A replicating asset is one whose cash flows <i>exactly</i> match, in all scenarios, the contractual cash flows of a <xref base="F55666942" href="IFRS17_APPA.dita#IFRS17_APPA/IFRS17_P0526">group of insurance contracts<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0159"/></ph></xref> in amount, timing and uncertainty. In some cases, a replicating asset may exist for some of the cash flows that arise from a group of insurance contracts. The fair value of that asset reflects both the expected present value of the cash flows from the asset and the risk associated with those cash flows. If a replicating portfolio of assets exists for some of the cash flows that arise from a group of insurance contracts, the entity can use the fair value of those assets to measure the relevant <xref base="F55666938" href="IFRS17_APPA.dita#IFRS17_APPA/IFRS17_P0525">fulfilment cash flows<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0143"/></ph></xref> instead of explicitly estimating the cash flows and discount rate.</p></body></paragraph>
