Consequently, applying <xref id="IFRS17_X0601" base="F60594443" href="../ias10/IAS10_TOC0001.dita#IAS10_TOC0001">IAS 10 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Events after the Reporting Period</ph></ph></xref>, an event occurring after the end of the reporting period that resolves an uncertainty that existed at the end of the reporting period does not provide evidence of the conditions that existed at that date. For example, there may be a 20 per cent probability at the end of the reporting period that a major storm will strike during the remaining six months of an <xref base="F55666957" href="IFRS17_APPA.dita#IFRS17_APPA/IFRS17_P0532">insurance contract<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0186"/></ph></xref>. After the end of the reporting period but before the financial statements are authorised for issue, a major storm strikes.

Instead, the cash flows included in the measurement include the 20 per cent probability apparent at the end of the reporting period (with disclosure applying IAS 10 that a non-adjusting event occurred after the end of the reporting period).</p></body></paragraph>
