Such contracts are <xref base="F55666957" href="IFRS17_APPA.dita#IFRS17_APPA/IFRS17_P0532">insurance contracts<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0186"/></ph></xref>, provided that the payment contingent on the insured event could be significant. For example, a life-contingent annuity linked to a cost-of-living index transfers <xref base="F55666976" href="IFRS17_APPA.dita#IFRS17_APPA/IFRS17_P0539">insurance risk<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0190"/></ph></xref> because the payment is triggered by an uncertain future event&#x2014;the survival of the person who receives the annuity. The link to the price index is a derivative, but it also transfers insurance risk because the number of payments to which the index applies depends on the survival of the annuitant. If the resulting transfer of insurance risk is significant, the derivative meets the definition of an insurance contract, in which case it shall not be separated from the host contract (see <xref id="IFRS17_X0546" base="F59236123" href="IFRS17_11.dita#IFRS17_11">paragraph 11(a)</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
