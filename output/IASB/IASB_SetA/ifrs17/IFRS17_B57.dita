The result for the example in <xref id="IFRS17_X0602" base="F59236246" href="IFRS17_B56.dita#IFRS17_B56">paragraph B56</xref> would typically be that the expected present value of death benefits changes, but not by as much as 20 per cent. In the example in paragraph B56, if mortality rates continue to be significantly higher than the previous estimates for reasons that are expected to continue, the estimated probability assigned to the high-mortality scenarios will increase.</p></body></paragraph>
