A contract is an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations.  Enforceability of the rights and obligations in a contract is a matter of law. Contracts can be written, oral or implied by an entity&#x2019;s customary business practices. Contractual terms include all terms in a contract, explicit or implied, but an entity shall disregard terms that have no commercial substance (ie no discernible effect on the economics of the contract). Implied terms in a contract include those imposed by law or regulation. The practices and processes for establishing contracts with customers vary across legal jurisdictions, industries and entities. In addition, they may vary within an entity (for example, they may depend on the class of customer or the nature of the promised goods or services).</p></body></paragraph>
