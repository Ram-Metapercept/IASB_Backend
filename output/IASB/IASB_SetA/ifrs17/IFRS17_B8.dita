Examples of non-financial variables not specific to a party to the contract include an index of earthquake losses in a particular region or temperatures in a particular city. Financial risk excludes risk from non-financial variables that are specific to a party to the contract, such as the occurrence or non-occurrence of a fire that damages or destroys an asset of that party. Furthermore, the risk of changes in the fair value of a non-financial asset is not a financial risk if the fair value reflects changes in the market prices for such assets (ie a financial variable) and the condition of a specific non-financial asset held by a party to a contract (ie a non-financial variable). For example, if a guarantee of the residual value of a specific car in which the <xref base="F55667014" href="IFRS17_APPA.dita#IFRS17_APPA/IFRS17_P0552">policyholder<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0291"/></ph></xref> has an insurable interest exposes the guarantor to the risk of changes in the car&#x2019;s physical condition, that risk is <xref base="F55666976" href="IFRS17_APPA.dita#IFRS17_APPA/IFRS17_P0539">insurance risk<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0190"/></ph></xref>, not financial risk.</p></body></paragraph>
