An entity has that practical ability in the absence of constraints that prevent the entity from setting the same price it would for a new contract with the same characteristics as the existing contract issued on that date, or if it can amend the benefits to be consistent with the price it will charge. Similarly, an entity has that practical ability to set a price when it can reprice an existing contract so that the price reflects overall changes in the risks in a <xref base="F55667018" href="IFRS17_APPA.dita#IFRS17_APPA/IFRS17_P0553">portfolio of insurance contracts<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0294"/></ph></xref>, even if the price set for each individual <xref base="F55667014" href="IFRS17_APPA.dita#IFRS17_APPA/IFRS17_P0552">policyholder<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0291"/></ph></xref> does not reflect the change in risk for that specific policyholder. When assessing whether the entity has the practical ability to set a price that fully reflects the risks in the contract or portfolio, it shall consider all the risks that it would consider when underwriting equivalent contracts on the renewal date for the remaining service. In determining the estimates of future cash flows at the end of a reporting period, an entity shall reassess the boundary of an <xref base="F55666957" href="IFRS17_APPA.dita#IFRS17_APPA/IFRS17_P0532">insurance contract<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0186"/></ph></xref> to include the effect of changes in circumstances on the entity&#x2019;s substantive rights and obligations.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
