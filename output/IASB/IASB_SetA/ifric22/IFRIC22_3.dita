The question specifically addressed circumstances in which an entity recognises a non-monetary liability arising from the receipt of advance consideration before it recognises the related revenue. In discussing the issue, the Interpretations Committee noted that the receipt or payment of advance consideration in a foreign currency is not restricted to revenue transactions.  Accordingly, the Interpretations Committee decided to clarify the date of the transaction for the purpose of determining the exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income when an entity has received or paid advance consideration in a foreign currency.</p></body></paragraph>
