<paragraph base="SL31823" id="IAS34_44"><paranum>44</paranum><prolog><data name="standard_number" value="IAS 34"/><data name="paranum" value="44"/></prolog><body><p id="IAS34_P0219">One objective of the preceding principle is to ensure that a single accounting             policy is applied to a particular class of transactions throughout an entire financial             year. Under <xref base="F16454005" href="../ias08/IAS08_TOC.dita#IAS08_TOC0001" id="IAS34_X0221">IAS 8</xref>, a change in accounting policy is reflected by             retrospective application, with restatement of prior period financial data as far back             as is practicable. However, if the cumulative amount of the adjustment relating to prior             financial years is impracticable  to determine, then under <xref base="F16454006" href="../ias08/IAS08_TOC.dita#IAS08_TOC0001" id="IAS34_X0223">IAS 8</xref> the new policy is applied prospectively from the earliest date             practicable. The effect of the principle in <xref base="A34-74" href="IAS34_43.dita#IAS34_43" id="IAS34_X0224">paragraph 43</xref> is to require             that within the current financial year any change in accounting policy is applied either             retrospectively or, if that is not practicable, prospectively, from no later than the             beginning of the financial year.</p></body></paragraph>
