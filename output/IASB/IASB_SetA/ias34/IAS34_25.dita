Thus, for example, unusual items, changes in accounting policies or estimates, and errors are recognised and disclosed on the basis of materiality in relation to interim period data to avoid misleading inferences that might result from non&#x2011;disclosure. The overriding goal is to ensure that an <xref base="SL147661" href="IAS34_4.dita#IAS34_4/IAS34_P0012">interim financial report<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0197"/></ph></xref> includes all information that is relevant to understanding an entity&#x2019;s financial position and performance during the interim period.</p></body></paragraph>
