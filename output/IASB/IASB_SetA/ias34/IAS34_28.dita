However, the frequency of an entity&#x2019;s reporting (annual, half&#x2011;yearly, or quarterly) shall not affect the measurement of its annual results. To achieve that objective, measurements for interim reporting purposes shall be made on a year&#x2011;to&#x2011;date basis.</p></body></paragraph>
