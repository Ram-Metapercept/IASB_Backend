However, an intragroup monetary asset (or liability), whether short&#x2011;term or long&#x2011;term, cannot be eliminated against the corresponding intragroup liability (or asset) without showing the results of currency fluctuations in the consolidated financial statements. This is because the <xref base="SL147531" href="IAS21_8.dita#IAS21_8/IAS21_P0034">monetary item<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0247"/></ph></xref> represents a commitment to convert one currency into another and exposes the reporting entity to a gain or loss through currency fluctuations. Accordingly, in the consolidated financial statements of the reporting entity, such an <xref base="SL147524" href="IAS21_8.dita#IAS21_8/IAS21_P0024">exchange difference<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0108"/></ph></xref> is recognised in profit or loss or, if it arises from the circumstances described in <xref base="A21-114" href="IAS21_32.dita#IAS21_32" id="IAS21_X0132">paragraph 32</xref>, it is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity until the disposal of the foreign operation.</p></body></paragraph>
