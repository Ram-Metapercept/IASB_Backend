Examples include: pensions and other employee benefits to be paid in cash; provisions that are to be settled in cash; lease liabilities; and cash dividends that are recognised as a liability. Similarly, a contract to receive (or deliver) a variable number of the entity&#x2019;s own equity instruments or a variable amount of assets in which the <xref base="SL147526" href="IAS21_8.dita#IAS21_8/IAS21_P0026">fair value<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0118"/></ph></xref> to be received (or delivered) equals a fixed or determinable number of units of currency is a monetary item. Conversely, the essential feature of a non&#x2011;monetary item is the absence of a right to receive (or an obligation to deliver) a fixed or determinable number of units of currency. Examples include: amounts prepaid for goods and services; goodwill; intangible assets; inventories; property, plant and equipment; right&#x2011;of&#x2011;use assets ; and provisions that are to be settled by the delivery of a non&#x2011;monetary asset.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
