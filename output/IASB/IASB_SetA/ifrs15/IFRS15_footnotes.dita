However, IFRS 15 was finalised and ready for approval by members of the IASB only after Mr Kalavacherla had retired from the IASB at the completion of his term on 31 December 2013.</p>       </fn><fn id="IFRS15_FN0002">       <p id="IFRS15_P5196">In these examples monetary amounts are denominated in &#x2018;currency units&#x2019; (CU).</p>       </fn><fn id="IFRS15_FN0003">       <p id="IFRS15_P5197">Revenue recognised is calculated as (20 per cent × CU3,500,000) + CU1,500,000.
