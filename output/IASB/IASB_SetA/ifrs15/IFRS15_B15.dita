Output methods include methods such as surveys of performance completed to date, appraisals of results achieved, milestones reached, time elapsed and units produced or units delivered. When an entity evaluates whether to apply an output method to measure its progress, the entity shall consider whether the output selected would faithfully depict the entity&#x2019;s performance towards complete satisfaction of the <xref base="F31716748" href="IFRS15_APPA.dita#IFRS15_APPA/IFRS15_P0504">performance obligation<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0288"/></ph></xref>. An output method would not provide a faithful depiction of the entity&#x2019;s performance if the output selected would fail to measure some of the goods or services for which control has transferred to the customer. For example, output methods based on units produced or units delivered would not faithfully depict an entity&#x2019;s performance in satisfying a performance obligation if, at the end of the reporting period, the entity&#x2019;s performance has produced work in progress or finished goods controlled by the customer that are not included in the measurement of the output.</p></body></paragraph>
