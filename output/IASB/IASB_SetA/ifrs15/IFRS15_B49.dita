In many cases, even though a non-refundable upfront fee relates to an activity that the entity is required to undertake at or near contract inception to fulfil the contract, that activity does not result in the transfer of a promised good or service to the <xref base="F31716740" href="IFRS15_APPA.dita#IFRS15_APPA/IFRS15_P0502">customer<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_customer"/></ph></xref> (see <xref id="IFRS15_X0690" base="F33213928" href="IFRS15_25.dita#IFRS15_25">paragraph 25</xref>).

The revenue recognition period would extend beyond the initial contractual period if the entity grants the customer the option to renew the contract and that option provides the customer with a material right as described in <xref id="IFRS15_X0693" base="F35311921" href="IFRS15_B40.dita#IFRS15_B40">paragraph B40</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
