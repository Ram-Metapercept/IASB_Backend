In other words, the entity is using the goods or services as inputs to produce or deliver the combined output or outputs specified by the customer.

In other words, each of the goods or services is significantly affected by one or more of the other goods or services in the contract. For example, in some cases, two or more goods or services are significantly affected by each other because the entity would not be able to fulfil its promise by transferring each of the goods or services independently. </p></li></ol></variant></body></paragraph>
