For some goods or services, a customer may be able to benefit from a good or service on its own. For other goods or services, a customer may be able to benefit from the good or service only in conjunction with other readily available resources. A readily available resource is a good or service that is sold separately (by the entity or another entity) or a resource that the customer has already obtained from the entity (including goods or services that the entity will have already transferred to the customer under the <xref base="SL31717224" href="IFRS15_APPA.dita#IFRS15_APPA/IFRS15_P0498">contract<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0049"/></ph></xref>) or from other transactions or events. Various factors may provide evidence that the customer can benefit from a good or service either on its own or in conjunction with other readily available resources. For example, the fact that the entity regularly sells a good or service separately would indicate that a customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or with other readily available resources.</p></body></paragraph>
