For some <xref base="SL31717224" href="IFRS15_APPA.dita#IFRS15_APPA/IFRS15_P0498">contracts<ph outputclass="def_xref"><xref keyref="GLOSSARY_DI0049"/></ph></xref>, control is transferred either when the product is delivered to the customer&#x2019;s site or when the product is shipped, depending on the terms of the contract (including delivery and shipping terms). However, for some contracts, a customer may obtain control of a product even though that product remains in an entity&#x2019;s physical possession. In that case, the customer has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the product even though it has decided not to exercise its right to take physical possession of that product. Consequently, the entity does not control the product. Instead, the entity provides custodial services to the customer over the customer&#x2019;s asset.</p></body></paragraph>
