The entity recalculates the gross carrying amount of a financial asset as the present value of the estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the renegotiated or modified financial asset that are discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate (or the original credit-adjusted effective interest rate for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets) or, when applicable, the revised effective interest rate calculated in accordance with paragraph 6.5.10. When estimating the expected cash flows of a financial asset, an entity shall consider all contractual terms of the financial asset (for example, prepayment, call and similar options) but shall not consider the expected credit losses, unless the financial asset is a purchased or originated credit-impaired financial asset, in which case an entity shall also consider the initial expected credit losses that were considered when calculating the original credit-adjusted effective interest rate.</p>   </glossdef><related-links class="- topic/related-links "><linklist id="GLOSSARY_P0770" class="- topic/linklist "><link href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_APPA.dita" base="F43925872" id="GLOSSARY_X0415" class="- topic/link "><linktext class="- topic/linktext ">IFRS 9.A</linktext></link></linklist></related-links></glossentry>
