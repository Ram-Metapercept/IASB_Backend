When calculating the credit-adjusted effective interest rate, an entity shall estimate the expected cash flows by considering all contractual terms of the financial asset (for example, prepayment, extension, call and similar options) and expected credit losses. The calculation includes all fees and points paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate (see paragraphs B5.4.1–B5.4.3), transaction costs, and all other premiums or discounts. There is a presumption that the cash flows and the expected life of a group of similar financial instruments can be estimated reliably. However, in those rare cases when it is not possible to reliably estimate the cash flows or the remaining life of a financial instrument (or group of financial instruments), the entity shall use the contractual cash flows over the full contractual term of the financial instrument (or group of financial instruments).</p>   </glossdef><related-links class="- topic/related-links "><linklist id="GLOSSARY_P0163" class="- topic/linklist "><link href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_APPA.dita" id="GLOSSARY_X0080" scope="local" class="- topic/link "><linktext class="- topic/linktext ">IFRS 9.A</linktext></link></linklist></related-links></glossentry>
