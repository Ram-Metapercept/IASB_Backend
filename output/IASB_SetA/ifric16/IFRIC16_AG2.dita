In addition, Parent can hedge the USD/GBP foreign exchange risk between the functional currencies of Subsidiary B and Subsidiary C. In its consolidated financial statements, Subsidiary B can hedge its net investment in Subsidiary C for the foreign exchange risk between their functional currencies of US dollars and pounds sterling. In the following examples the designated risk is the spot foreign exchange risk because the hedging instruments are not derivatives. If the hedging instruments were forward contracts, Parent could designate the forward foreign exchange risk.</p><image href="graphics/IFRIC16_AG2-graphic.png" id="IFRIC16_AG2_graphic_pdf" otherprops="print" placement="inline" class="- topic/image "/></body></paragraph>
