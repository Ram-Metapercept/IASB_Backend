For example, a purchased option derives its value from its potential to produce economic benefits through exercise of the option at a future date. However, the economic resource is the present rightâ€”the right to exercise the option at a future date. The economic resource is not the future economic benefits that the holder will receive if the option is exercised.</p></body></paragraph>
