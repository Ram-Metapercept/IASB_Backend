First, identify an economic phenomenon, information about which is capable of being useful to users of the reporting entityâ€™s financial information. Second, identify the type of information about that phenomenon that would be most relevant. Third, determine whether that information is available and whether it can provide a faithful representation of the economic phenomenon. If so, the process of satisfying the fundamental qualitative characteristics ends at that point. If not, the process is repeated with the next most relevant type of information.</p></body></paragraph>
