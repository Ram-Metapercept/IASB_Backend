For example, in a hedging relationship in which a group of items is hedged for       changes in an interest rate benchmark subject to interest rate benchmark reform, the hedged       cash flows or fair value of some items in the group could be changed to reference an       alternative benchmark rate before other items in the group are changed. In this example, in       applying paragraph 102P, the entity would designate the alternative benchmark rate as the       hedged risk for that relevant subgroup of hedged items. The entity would continue to designate       the existing interest rate benchmark as the hedged risk for the other subgroup of hedged items       until the hedged cash flows or fair value of those items are changed to reference the       alternative benchmark rate or the items expire and are replaced with hedged items that       reference the alternative benchmark rate.</p></body></paragraph>
