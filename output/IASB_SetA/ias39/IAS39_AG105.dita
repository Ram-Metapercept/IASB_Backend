Such an expectation can be demonstrated in various ways,           including a comparison of past changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item           that are attributable to the hedged risk with past changes in the fair value or cash flows           of the hedging instrument, or by demonstrating a high statistical correlation between the           fair value or cash flows of the hedged item and those of             the hedging instrument. The entity may choose a hedge ratio of other than one to one in order to           improve the effectiveness of the hedge as described in <xref href="IAS39_AG100.dita#IAS39_AG100" base="F16149988" id="IAS39_X0982" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph AG100</xref>.</p>                </li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(b)</li_value>         <p base="SL135273" id="IAS39_P1195" class="- topic/p ">The actual results of the hedge are within a range of 80–125 per cent. For example, if actual results are such that the loss on the hedging instrument is CU120 and the gain on the cash instrument is CU100, offset can be measured by 120/100, which is 120 per cent, or by 100/120, which is 83 per cent. In this example, assuming the hedge meets the condition in (a), the entity would conclude that the hedge has been highly effective.</p>       </li></ol></body></paragraph>
