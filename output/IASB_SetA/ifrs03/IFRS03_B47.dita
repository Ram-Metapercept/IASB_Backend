In addition, the acquirer in a combination of mutual entities shall recognise the acquiree’s net assets as a direct addition to capital or equity in its statement of financial position, not as an addition to retained earnings, which is consistent with the way in which other types of entities apply the acquisition method.</p></body></paragraph>
