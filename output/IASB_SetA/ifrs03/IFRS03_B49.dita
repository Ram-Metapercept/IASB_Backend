For example, a present value technique  may be used to measure the fair value of a mutual entity. The cash flows used as inputs to the model should be based on the expected cash flows  of the mutual entity, which are likely to reflect reductions for member benefits, such as reduced fees charged for goods and services.</p></body></paragraph>
