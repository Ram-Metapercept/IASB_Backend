For example, an indemnification may relate to a contingent liability that is not recognised at the acquisition date because its fair value is not reliably measurable at that date. Alternatively, an indemnification may relate to an asset or a liability, for example, one that results from an employee benefit, that is measured on a basis other than acquisition‑date fair value. In those circumstances, the indemnification asset shall be recognised and measured using assumptions consistent with those used to measure the indemnified item, subject to management’s assessment of the collectibility of the indemnification asset and any contractual limitations on the indemnified amount. <xref href="IFRS03_g57-57.dita#IFRS03_g57_57" id="IFRS03_X0196" base="F5309954" class="- topic/xref ">Paragraph 57</xref> provides guidance on the subsequent accounting for an indemnification asset.</p></body></paragraph>
