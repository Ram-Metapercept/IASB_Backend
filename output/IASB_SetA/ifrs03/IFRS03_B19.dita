The entity whose equity interests are acquired (the legal acquiree) must be the acquirer for accounting purposes for the transaction to be considered a reverse acquisition. For example, reverse acquisitions sometimes occur when a private operating entity wants to become a public entity but does not want to register its equity shares. To accomplish that, the private entity will arrange for a public entity to acquire its equity interests in exchange for the equity interests of the public entity. In this example, the public entity is the <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">legal acquirer</b> because it issued its equity interests, and the private entity is the <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">legal acquiree</b> because its equity interests were acquired.
