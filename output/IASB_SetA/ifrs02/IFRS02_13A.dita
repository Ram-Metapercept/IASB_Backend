The entity shall measure the identifiable goods or services received in accordance with this IFRS. The entity shall measure the unidentifiable goods or services received (or to be received) as the difference between the fair value of the share‑based payment and the fair value of any identifiable goods or services received (or to be received). The entity shall measure the unidentifiable goods or services received at the grant date. However, for cash‑settled transactions, the liability shall be remeasured at the end of each reporting period until it is settled in accordance with <xref href="IFRS02_g30-33D.dita#IFRS02_g30_33D" id="IFRS02_X0122" base="F9048127" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs 30–33</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
