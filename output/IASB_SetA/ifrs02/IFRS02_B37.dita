It may be necessary to use an appropriate substitute, if no such government issues exist or circumstances indicate that the implied yield on zero‑coupon government issues is not representative of the risk‑free interest rate (for example, in high inflation economies). Also, an appropriate substitute should be used if market participants would typically determine the risk‑free interest rate by using that substitute, rather than the implied yield of zero‑coupon government issues, when estimating the fair value of an option with a life equal to the expected term of the option being valued.</p></body></paragraph>
