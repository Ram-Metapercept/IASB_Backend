Similarly, if the shares are subject to restrictions on transfer after vesting date, that factor shall be taken into account, but only to the extent that the post‑vesting restrictions affect the price that a knowledgeable, willing market participant would pay for that share. For example, if the shares are actively traded in a deep and liquid market, post‑vesting transfer restrictions may have little, if any, effect on the price that a knowledgeable, willing market participant would pay for those shares.  Restrictions on transfer or other restrictions that exist during the vesting period shall not be taken into account when estimating the grant date fair value of the shares granted, because those restrictions stem from the existence of vesting conditions, which are accounted for in accordance with <xref href="IFRS02_g19-21.dita#IFRS02_g19_21/IFRS02_g19_21_TI" id="IFRS02_X0379" base="F753252" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs 19–21</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
