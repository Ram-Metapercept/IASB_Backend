IFRS 7 defines liquidity risk as ‘the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset’. The Committee observed that reverse factoring arrangements often give rise to liquidity risk because:</p>     <ol outputclass="static" type="lower-alpha" class="- topic/ol "><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">a.</li_value><p class="- topic/p ">the entity has concentrated a portion of its liabilities with               one financial institution rather than a diverse group of suppliers. The entity may               also obtain other sources of funding from the financial institution providing the               reverse factoring arrangement. If the entity were to encounter any difficulty in               meeting its obligations, such a concentration would increase the risk that the entity               might have to pay a significant amount, at one time, to one counterparty.</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">b.</li_value><p class="- topic/p ">the entity may have become reliant on extended payment terms or the entity’s supplier may have become accustomed to, or reliant on, earlier payment under the reverse factoring arrangement.
