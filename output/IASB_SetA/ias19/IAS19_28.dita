Thus, the amount of the post‑employment benefits received by the employee is determined by the amount of contributions paid by an entity (and perhaps also the employee) to a post‑employment benefit plan or to an insurance company, together with investment returns arising from the contributions. In consequence, actuarial risk (that benefits will be less than expected) and investment risk (that assets invested will be insufficient to meet expected benefits) fall, in substance, on the employee.</p></body></paragraph>
