For example, if an entity is assessing a bond with a five-year term and the variable interest rate is reset every six months to a five‑year rate, the entity cannot conclude that the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding simply because the interest rate curve at the time of the assessment is such that the difference between a five-year interest rate and a six‑month interest rate is not significant. Instead, the entity must also consider whether the relationship between the five-year interest rate and the six‑month interest rate could change over the life of the instrument such that the contractual (undiscounted) cash flows over the life of the instrument could be significantly different from the (undiscounted) benchmark cash flows. However, an entity must consider only reasonably possible scenarios instead of every possible scenario. If an entity concludes that the contractual (undiscounted) cash flows could be significantly different from the (undiscounted) benchmark cash flows, the financial asset does not meet the condition in <xref href="IFRS09_4.1.2.dita#IFRS09_4_1_2" id="IFRS09_X1201" base="F41907842" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs 4.1.2(b)</xref> and <xref href="IFRS09_4.1.2A.dita#IFRS09_4_1_2A" id="IFRS09_X1202" base="F41907843" class="- topic/xref ">4.1.2A(b)</xref> and therefore cannot be measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income.</p></body></paragraph>
