For practical purposes the entity need not enter into all of the assets and liabilities giving rise to an accounting mismatch at exactly the same time. A reasonable delay is permitted provided that any remaining transactions are expected to occur. An entity must apply consistently its methodology for determining whether presenting in other comprehensive income the effects of changes in the liability’s credit risk would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss. However, an entity may use different methodologies when there are different economic relationships between the characteristics of the liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss and the characteristics of the other financial instruments. <xref href="../ifrs07/IFRS07_TOC.dita#IFRS07_TOC0001/IFRS07_TOC0001_V2" base="F70603185" id="IFRS09_X1485" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 7</xref> requires an entity to provide qualitative disclosures in the notes to the financial statements about its methodology for making that determination.</p></body></paragraph>
