This designation is available only at inception of the contract and only if it eliminates or significantly reduces a recognition inconsistency (sometimes referred to as an ‘accounting mismatch’) that would otherwise arise from not recognising that contract because it is excluded from the scope of this Standard (see <xref href="IFRS09_2.4.dita#IFRS09_2_4" id="IFRS09_X0212" base="F68104406" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 2.4</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
