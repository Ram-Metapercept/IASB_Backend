An embedded derivative causes some or all of the cash flows that otherwise would be required by the contract to be modified according to a specified interest rate, financial instrument price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index of prices or rates, credit rating or credit index, or other variable, provided in the case of a non‑financial variable that the variable is not specific to a party to the contract. A derivative that is attached to a <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">financial instrument</i> but is contractually transferable independently of that instrument, or has a different counterparty, is not an embedded derivative, but a separate financial instrument.</p></body></paragraph>
