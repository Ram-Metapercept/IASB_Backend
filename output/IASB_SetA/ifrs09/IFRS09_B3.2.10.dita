The part of the interest payments that the entity would give up upon termination or transfer of the servicing contract is allocated to the servicing asset or servicing liability. The part of the interest payments that the entity would not give up is an interest‑only strip receivable. For example, if the entity would not give up any interest upon termination or transfer of the servicing contract, the entire interest spread is an interest‑only strip receivable. For the purposes of applying <xref href="IFRS09_3.2.13.dita" scope="local" id="IFRS09_X1098" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 3.2.13</xref>, the fair values of the servicing asset and interest‑only strip receivable are used to allocate the carrying amount of the receivable between the part of the asset that is derecognised and the part that continues to be recognised. If there is no servicing fee specified or the fee to be received is not expected to compensate the entity adequately for performing the servicing, a liability for the servicing obligation is recognised at fair value.</p></body></paragraph>
