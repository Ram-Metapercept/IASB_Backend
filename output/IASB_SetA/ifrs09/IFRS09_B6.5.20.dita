The measurement of the changes in the value of the hedged item related to the volume that continues to be designated also remains unaffected. However, from the date of rebalancing, the volume by which the hedged item was decreased is no longer part of the hedging relationship. For example, if an entity originally hedged a volume of 100 tonnes of a commodity at a forward price of CU80 and reduces that volume by 10 tonnes on rebalancing, the hedged item after rebalancing would be 90 tonnes hedged at CU80. The 10 tonnes of the hedged item that are no longer part of the hedging relationship would be accounted for in accordance with the requirements for the discontinuation of hedge accounting (see <xref href="IFRS09_6.5.6.dita" scope="local" id="IFRS09_X1596" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs 6.5.6–6.5.7</xref> and <xref href="IFRS09_gB6.5.22-B6.5.28.dita" scope="local" id="IFRS09_X1597" class="- topic/xref ">B6.5.22–B6.5.28</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
