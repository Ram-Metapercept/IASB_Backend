This typically means measuring the loss allowance at an amount equal to 12‑month expected credit losses until the requirements for the recognition of lifetime expected credit losses in paragraph 5.5.3 are met. However, in some unusual circumstances following a modification that results in derecognition of the original financial asset, there may be evidence that the modified financial asset is credit-impaired at initial recognition, and thus, the financial asset should be recognised as an originated credit‑impaired financial asset.  This might occur, for example, in a situation in which there was a substantial modification of a distressed asset that resulted in the derecognition of the original financial asset . In such a case, it may be possible for the modification to result in a new financial asset which is credit‑impaired at initial recognition.</p></body></paragraph>
