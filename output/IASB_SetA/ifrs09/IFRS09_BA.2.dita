An entity may have a contract to buy or sell a non-financial item that can be settled net in cash or another financial instrument or by exchanging financial instruments (eg a contract to buy or sell a commodity at a fixed price at a future date). Such a contract is within the scope of this Standard unless it was entered into and continues to be held for the purpose of delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with the entity’s expected purchase, sale or usage requirements. However, this Standard applies to such contracts for an entity’s expected purchase, sale or usage requirements if the entity makes a designation in accordance with <xref href="IFRS09_2.5.dita#IFRS09_2_5" id="IFRS09_X1659" base="F43475340" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 2.5</xref> (see <xref href="IFRS09_2.4.dita#IFRS09_2_4" id="IFRS09_X1660" base="F43475341" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs 2.4–2.7</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
