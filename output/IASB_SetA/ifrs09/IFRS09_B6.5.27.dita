However, if an entity has a history of having designated hedges of forecast transactions and having subsequently determined that the forecast transactions are no longer expected to occur, the entity’s ability to predict forecast transactions accurately is called into question when predicting similar forecast transactions. This affects the assessment of whether similar forecast transactions are highly probable (see <xref href="IFRS09_6.3.3.dita#IFRS09_6_3_3" id="IFRS09_X1601" base="F43475299" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 6.3.3</xref>) and hence whether they are eligible as hedged items.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
