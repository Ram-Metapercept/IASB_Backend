This Standard defines the minimum content of an interim financial report as including condensed financial statements  and selected explanatory notes . The interim financial report is intended to provide an update on the latest complete set of annual financial statements. Accordingly, it focuses on new activities, events, and circumstances and does not duplicate information previously reported.</p></body></paragraph>
