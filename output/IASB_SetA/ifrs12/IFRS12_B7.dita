Consideration of the purpose and design of the other entity may help the reporting entity when assessing whether it has an interest in that entity and, therefore, whether it is required to provide the disclosures in this IFRS. That assessment shall include consideration of the risks that the other entity was designed to create and the risks the other entity was designed to pass on to the reporting entity and other parties.</p></body></paragraph>
