National laws typically define a co‑operative as a society endeavouring to promote its members’ economic advancement by way of a joint business operation (the principle of self‑help). Members’ interests in a co‑operative are often characterised as members’ shares, units or the like, and are referred to below as ‘members’ shares’.</p></body></paragraph>
