Paragraph B2 of IFRS 3 states that ‘A group of individuals shall be regarded as controlling an entity when, as a result of contractual arrangements, they collectively have the power to govern its financial and operating policies so as to obtain benefits from its activities.’ Therefore, for a distribution to be outside the scope of this Interpretation on the basis that the same parties control the asset both before and after the distribution, a group of individual shareholders receiving the distribution must have, as a result of contractual arrangements, such ultimate collective power over the entity making the distribution.</p></body></paragraph>
