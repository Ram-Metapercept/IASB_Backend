The decline in fair value does not normally relate to the condition of the investments at the end of the reporting period, but reflects circumstances that have arisen subsequently. Therefore, an entity does not adjust the amounts recognised in its financial statements for the investments. Similarly, the entity does not update the amounts disclosed for the investments as at the end of the reporting period, although it may need to give additional disclosure under <xref href="IAS10_21.dita#IAS10_21" id="IAS10_X0057" base="A10-43" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 21</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
