However, that presumption can be rebutted only on initial recognition for a biological asset for which quoted market prices              are not available and for which alternative fair value measurements              are determined to be clearly unreliable. In such a case, that biological asset shall be measured at its cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Once the fair value of such a biological asset becomes reliably measurable, an entity shall measure it at its fair value less costs to sell.
