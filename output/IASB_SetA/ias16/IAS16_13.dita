For example, a furnace may require relining after a specified number of hours of use, or aircraft interiors such as seats and galleys may require replacement several times during the life of the airframe. Items of property, plant and equipment may also be acquired to make a less frequently recurring replacement, such as replacing the interior walls of a building, or to make a nonrecurring replacement. Under the recognition principle in <xref href="IAS16_7.dita#IAS16_7" id="IAS16_X0123" base="A16-129" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 7</xref>, an entity recognises in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment the cost of replacing part of such an item when that cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met. The carrying amount of those parts that are replaced is derecognised in accordance with the derecognition provisions of this Standard (see <xref href="IAS16_g67-72.dita#IAS16_g67_72" id="IAS16_X0124" base="F16451485" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs 67–72</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
