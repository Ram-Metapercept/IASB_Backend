For example, if a decision maker is significantly involved in the design of the investee (including in determining the scope of decision‑making authority), that involvement may indicate that the decision maker had the opportunity and incentive to obtain rights that result in the decision maker having the ability to direct the relevant activities.</p></body></paragraph>
