Accordingly, any consideration received or paid for such a contract is added directly to or deducted directly from equity. One example is an issued share option that gives the counterparty a right to buy a fixed number of the entity’s shares for a fixed amount of cash. However, if the contract requires the entity to purchase (redeem) its own shares for cash or another financial asset at a fixed or determinable date or on demand, the entity also recognises a financial liability for the present value of the redemption amount (with the exception of instruments that have all the features and meet the conditions in <xref href="IAS32_g16A-16B.dita#IAS32_g16A_16B/IAS32_g16A_16B_TI" base="F6037590" id="IAS32_X0630" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs 16A and 16B</xref> or <xref href="IAS32_g16C-16D.dita#IAS32_g16C_16D/IAS32_g16C_16D_TI" base="F6037591" id="IAS32_X0631" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs 16C and 16D</xref>).

An example is a written option to buy gold that, if exercised, is settled net in the entity’s own instruments by the entity delivering as many of those instruments as are equal to the value of the option contract. Such a contract is a financial asset or financial liability even if the underlying variable is the entity’s own share price rather than gold. Similarly, a contract that will be settled in a fixed number of the entity’s own shares, but the rights attaching to those shares will be varied so that the settlement value equals a fixed amount or an amount based on changes in an underlying variable, is a financial asset or a financial liability.</p>                </li></ol></body></paragraph>
