Such an agreement provides for a single net settlement of all financial instruments covered by the agreement in the event of default on, or termination of, any one contract. These arrangements are commonly used by financial institutions to provide protection against loss in the event of bankruptcy or other circumstances that result in a counterparty being unable to meet its obligations. A master netting arrangement commonly creates a right of set‑off that becomes enforceable and affects the realisation or settlement of individual financial assets and financial liabilities only following a specified event of default or in other circumstances not expected to arise in the normal course of business. A master netting arrangement does not provide a basis for offsetting unless both of the criteria in <xref href="IAS32_42.dita#IAS32_42/IAS32_42_V2" id="IAS32_X0444" base="F19320829" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 42</xref> are satisfied. When financial assets and financial liabilities subject to a master netting arrangement are not offset, the effect of the arrangement on an entity’s exposure to credit risk is disclosed in accordance with <xref href="../ifrs07/IFRS07_36.dita#IFRS07_36" id="IAS32_X0445" base="F445683" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 36 of IFRS 7</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
