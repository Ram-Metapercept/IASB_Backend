For example, contracts that provide for settlement only by the receipt or delivery of a non‑financial item (eg an option, futures or forward contract on silver) are not financial instruments. Many commodity contracts are of this type. Some are standardised in form and traded on organised markets in much the same fashion as some derivative financial instruments. For example, a commodity futures contract may be bought and sold readily for cash because it is listed for trading on an exchange and may change hands many times. However, the parties buying and selling the contract are, in effect, trading the underlying commodity. The ability to buy or sell a commodity contract for cash, the ease with which it may be bought or sold and the possibility of negotiating a cash settlement of the obligation to receive or deliver the commodity do not alter the fundamental character of the contract in a way that creates a financial instrument. Nevertheless, some contracts to buy or sell non‑financial items that can be settled net or by exchanging financial instruments, or in which the non‑financial item is readily convertible to cash, are within the scope of the Standard as if they were financial instruments (see <xref href="IAS32_8.dita#IAS32_8" id="IAS32_X0597" base="SL181628" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 8</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
