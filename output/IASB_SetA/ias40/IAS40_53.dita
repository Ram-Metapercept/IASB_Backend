However, in exceptional cases, there is clear evidence when an entity first acquires an investment property (or when an existing property first becomes investment property after a change in use) that the fair value of the investment property is not reliably measurable on a continuing basis. This arises when, and only when, the market for comparable properties is inactive (eg there are few recent transactions, price quotations are not current or observed transaction prices indicate that the seller was forced to sell) and alternative reliable measurements of fair value (for example, based on discounted cash flow projections) are not available. If an entity determines that the fair value of an investment property under construction is not reliably measurable but expects the fair value of the property to be reliably measurable when construction is complete, it shall measure that investment property under construction at cost until either its fair value becomes reliably measurable or construction is completed (whichever is earlier).  If an entity determines that the fair value of an investment property (other than an investment property under construction) is not reliably measurable on a continuing basis, the entity shall measure that investment property using the cost model in <xref href="../IAS16.ditamap" base="F46591477" id="IAS40_X0245" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 16</xref> for owned investment property  or in accordance with <xref href="../ifrs16/IFRS16_TOC.dita#IFRS16_TOC0001" base="F46976553" id="IAS40_X0247" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 16</xref> for investment property held by a lessee as a right-of-use asset .
