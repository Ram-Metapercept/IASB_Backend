Thus, for transactions and other events recognised in profit or loss, any related tax effects are also recognised in profit or loss. For transactions and other events recognised outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity),  any related tax effects are also recognised outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively).  Similarly, the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities in a business combination  affects the amount of goodwill arising in that business combination or the amount of the bargain purchase gain recognised. </p><p base="SL143749" id="IAS12_P0011" class="- topic/p ">This Standard also deals with the recognition of deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses or unused tax credits, the presentation of income taxes in the financial statements and the disclosure of information relating to income taxes. </p></body></topic>
