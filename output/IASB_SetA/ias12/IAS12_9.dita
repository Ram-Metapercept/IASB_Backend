For example, research costs are recognised as an expense in determining accounting profit in the period in which they are incurred  but may not be permitted as a deduction in determining taxable profit (tax loss) until a later period. The difference between the tax base of the research costs, being the amount the taxation authorities will permit as a deduction in future periods, and the carrying amount of nil is a deductible temporary difference that results in a deferred tax asset.</p></body></paragraph>
