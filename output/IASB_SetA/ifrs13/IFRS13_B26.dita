Accordingly, the expected cash flows are discounted at a rate that corresponds to an expected rate associated with probability‑weighted cash flows (ie an expected rate of return). Models used for pricing risky assets, such as the capital asset pricing model, can be used to estimate the expected rate of return. Because the discount rate used in the discount rate adjustment technique is a rate of return relating to conditional cash flows, it is likely to be higher than the discount rate used in Method 2 of the expected present value technique, which is an expected rate of return relating to expected or probability‑weighted cash flows.</p></body></paragraph>
