A measurement that does not include an adjustment for risk would not represent a fair value measurement if market participants would include one when pricing the asset or liability. For example, it might be necessary to include a risk adjustment when there is significant measurement uncertainty (eg when there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity when compared with normal market activity for the asset or liability, or similar assets or liabilities, and the entity has determined that the transaction price or quoted price does not represent fair value, as described in <xref href="IFRS13_gB37-B47.dita#IFRS13_gB37_B47/IFRS13_gB37_B47_TI" id="IFRS13_X0304" base="F18888991" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs B37–B47</xref>). </p></body></paragraph>
