Goodwill does not generate cash flows independently of other assets or groups of assets, and often contributes to the cash flows of multiple cash‑generating units. Goodwill sometimes cannot be allocated on a non‑arbitrary basis to individual cash‑generating units, but only to groups of cash‑generating units. As a result, the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes sometimes comprises a number of cash‑generating units to which the goodwill relates, but to which it cannot be allocated.
