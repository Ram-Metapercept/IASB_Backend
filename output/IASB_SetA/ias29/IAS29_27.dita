This gain or loss on the net monetary position may be derived as the difference resulting from the restatement of non‑monetary assets,  owners’ equity and items in the statement of comprehensive income and the adjustment of index linked assets and liabilities. The gain or loss may be estimated by applying the change in a general price index to the weighted average for the period of the difference between monetary assets and monetary liabilities.</p></body></paragraph>
