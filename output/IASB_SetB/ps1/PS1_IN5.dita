However, the form and content of management commentary may vary by entity. Thus, the Statement also provides principles to enable entities to adapt the information they provide to the particular circumstances of their business, including the legal and economic circumstances of individual jurisdictions. This flexible approach will generate more meaningful disclosure by encouraging entities that choose to present management commentary to discuss those matters that are most relevant to their individual circumstances.</p></body></paragraph>
