Instead, the entity accounts for any change in estimated useful life or amortisation pattern prospectively from the period when it makes that change in estimate (<xref href="IFRS01_14.dita#IFRS01_14" id="IFRS01_X1308" base="F15829052" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 14</xref> of the IFRS and <xref href="../ias38/IAS38_104.dita#IAS38_104" id="IFRS01_X1309" base="F15829053" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 104 of IAS 38</xref>).  However, in some cases, an entity’s amortisation methods and rates in accordance with previous GAAP may differ from those that would be acceptable in accordance with IFRSs (for example, if they were adopted solely for tax purposes and do not reflect a reasonable estimate of the asset’s useful life). If those differences have a material effect on the financial statements, the entity adjusts the accumulated amortisation in its opening IFRS statement of financial position retrospectively so that it complies with IFRSs (<xref href="IFRS01_14.dita#IFRS01_14" id="IFRS01_X1311" base="F15829138" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 14</xref> of the IFRS).

Subsequent amortisation is based on that deemed cost and starts from the date of transition to IFRSs.</p></body></paragraph>
