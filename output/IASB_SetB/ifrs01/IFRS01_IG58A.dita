Because all derivatives, other than those that are financial guarantee contracts, a commitment to provide a loan at a below-market interest rate, a loan commitment that is subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9 or are designated and effective hedging instruments, are measured at fair value through profit or loss, the differences between the previous carrying amount (which may have been zero) and the fair value of the derivatives are recognised as an adjustment of the balance of retained earnings at the beginning of the financial year in which IFRS 9 is initially applied (other than for a derivative that is a financial guarantee contract, a commitment to provide a loan at a below-market interest rate or a designated and effective hedging instrument).</p></body></paragraph>
