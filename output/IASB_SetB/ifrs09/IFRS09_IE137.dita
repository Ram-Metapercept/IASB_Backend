However, Entity B’s interest expense is affected by the hedge ineffectiveness that arises on its hedging relationships. In Period 2 the interest expense is slightly higher than the fixed rate payments locked in with the interest rate swap because the variable payments received under the interest rate swap are less than the total of the cash flows resulting from the aggregated exposure.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS09_FN0069" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/> In Periods 3 and 4 the interest expense is equal to the locked in rate because the variable payments received under the swap are more than the total of the cash flows resulting from the aggregated exposure.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS09_FN0070" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/></p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
