The only debt in the capital structure is a five-year public bond with a restriction on further borrowing as the only bond covenant. Company A reports quarterly to its shareholders. Entity B is one of many investors in the bond. Entity B considers the bond to have low credit risk at initial recognition in accordance with <xref href="IFRS09_5.5.10.dita#IFRS09_5_5_10" id="IFRS09_X1728" base="F70814241" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 5.5.10 of IFRS 9</xref>. This is because the bond has a low risk of default and Company A is considered to have a strong capacity to meet its obligations in the near term. Entity B’s expectations for the longer term are that adverse changes in economic and business conditions may, but will not necessarily, reduce Company A’s ability to fulfil its obligations on the bond. In addition, at initial recognition the bond had an internal credit rating that is correlated to a global external credit rating of investment grade.</p></body></paragraph>
