This hedging relationship is designated at the end of Period 1, when Entity B decides to lock in its interest payments and hence swaps its aggregated variable rate exposure in LC into a fixed rate exposure in LC, with a term to the end of Period 4. The aggregated exposure that is designated as the hedged item represents, in LC, the variability in cash flows that is the effect of changes in the combined cash flows of the two items designated in the fair value hedge of the fair value interest rate risk and FX risk (see (a) above), compared to the interest rates at the end of Period 1 (ie the time of designation of the hedging relationship between the aggregated exposure and the interest rate swap).</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
