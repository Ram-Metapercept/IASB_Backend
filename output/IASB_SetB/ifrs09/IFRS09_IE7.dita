Bank X provides a tranche of that loan facility to Company Y. At the time of origination of the loan by Bank X, although Company Y’s leverage was relatively high compared with other issuers with similar credit risk, it was expected that Company Y would be able to meet the covenants for the life of the instrument. In addition, the generation of revenue and cash flow was expected to be stable in Company Y’s industry over the term of the senior facility. However, there was some business risk related to the ability to grow gross margins within its existing businesses.</p></body></paragraph>
