Consequently, applying fair value hedge accounting with the aggregated exposure as the hedged item does not result in changing the hedged item’s measurement but instead affects where the hedging gains and losses are recognised (ie reclassification from the cash flow hedge reserve to profit or loss).</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P4134" base="SL32829713" class="- topic/p ">The amount in the cash flow hedge reserve at the end of Period 1 (LC42,310) is amortised over the remaining life of the cash flow hedge for the first level relationship (ie over Periods 2 to 4).<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS09_FN0077" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/></p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
