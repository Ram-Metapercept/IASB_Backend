By using its credit risk models Bank A determines that the exposure at default on the credit card facilities for which lifetime expected credit losses should be recognised, is CU25,000 (ie the drawn balance of CU20,000 plus further draw‑downs of CU5,000 from the available undrawn commitment). The exposure at default of the credit card facilities for which 12-month expected credit losses are recognised, is CU45,000 (ie the outstanding balance of CU40,000 and an additional draw‑down of CU5,000 from the undrawn commitment over the next 12 months).</p></body></paragraph>
