It determines that given the risk of default reflected in its internal risk rating grades, a change in internal rating from 3 to 4 would not represent a significant increase in credit risk but that there has been a significant increase in credit risk on any loan in this portfolio that has an internal rating worse than 5. This means that Bank A does not have to know the initial credit rating of each loan in the portfolio to assess the change in credit risk since initial recognition. It only has to determine whether the credit risk is worse than 5 at the reporting date to determine whether lifetime expected credit losses should be recognised in accordance with <xref href="IFRS09_5.5.3.dita#IFRS09_5_5_3" id="IFRS09_X1740" base="F43660332" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 5.5.3 of IFRS 9</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
