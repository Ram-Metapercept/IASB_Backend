Differences arising from recognising a monetary item at a foreign currency amount different from that at which it was previously recognised are accounted for in a similar manner, since all changes in the carrying amount relating to foreign currency movements should be treated consistently.

For example, although an entity recognises gains and losses on financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income in other comprehensive income (<xref href="IFRS09_g5.7.10-5.7.11.dita#IFRS09_g5_7_10_5_7_11/IFRS09_g5_7_10_5_7_11_TI" base="F43753109" id="IFRS09_X1985" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs 5.7.10</xref> and <xref href="IFRS09_B5.7.2A.dita#IFRS09_B5_7_2A" base="F71119420" id="IFRS09_X1986" class="- topic/xref ">B5.7.2A of IFRS 9</xref>), the entity nevertheless recognises the changes in the carrying amount relating to changes in foreign exchange rates in profit or loss (<xref href="../ias21/IAS21_g23-26.dita#IAS21_g23_26/IAS21_g23_26_TI" base="F43753111" id="IFRS09_X1987" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 23(a) of IAS 21</xref>).</p><p base="F32876847" id="IFRS09_P5379" class="- topic/p ">Any changes in the carrying amount of a <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">non-monetary item</i> are recognised in profit or loss or in other comprehensive income in accordance with IFRS 9.
