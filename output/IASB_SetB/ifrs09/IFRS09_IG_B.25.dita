For example, the interest rate may be stated as 16 per cent for the first 10 years and as zero per cent in subsequent periods. In that case, the initial amount is amortised to zero over the first 10 years using the effective interest method, since a portion of the contractual interest payments represents repayments of the gross carrying amount. The gross carrying amount is zero after Year 10 because the present value of the stream of future cash payments in subsequent periods is zero (there are no further contractual cash payments in subsequent periods).</p></body></topic>
