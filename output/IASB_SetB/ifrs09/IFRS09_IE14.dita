Bank B applies its own internal rating methods to determine credit risk and allocates a specific internal rating score to its loans. Bank B’s internal rating categories are based on historical, current and forward-looking information and reflect the credit risk for the tenor of the loans. On initial recognition, Bank B determines that the loan is subject to considerable credit risk, has speculative elements and that the uncertainties affecting Company C, including the group’s uncertain prospects for cash generation, could lead to default. However, Bank B does not consider the loan to be originated credit-impaired because it does not meet the definition of a purchased or originated credit-impaired financial asset in <xref href="IFRS09_APPA.dita#IFRS09_APPA/IFRS09_APPA_TI" id="IFRS09_X1712" base="F70814061" class="- topic/xref ">Appendix A of IFRS 9</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
