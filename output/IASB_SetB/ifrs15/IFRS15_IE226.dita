The entity does not provide a significant service of integrating the training services with the product (see <xref href="IFRS15_29.dita#IFRS15_29" id="IFRS15_X1416" base="F49537686" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 29(a) of IFRS 15</xref>). The training services and product do not significantly modify or customise each other (see <xref href="IFRS15_29.dita#IFRS15_29" id="IFRS15_X1417" base="F49537687" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 29(b) of IFRS 15</xref>). The product and the training services are not highly interdependent or highly interrelated (see <xref href="IFRS15_29.dita#IFRS15_29" id="IFRS15_X1418" base="F49537688" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 29(c) of IFRS 15</xref>). The entity would be able to fulfil its promise to transfer the product independently of its efforts to subsequently provide the training services, and would be able to provide training services to any customer that had previously acquired its product. Consequently, the entity concludes that its promise to transfer the product and its promise to provide training services are not inputs to a combined item, and, therefore, are each separately identifiable.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
