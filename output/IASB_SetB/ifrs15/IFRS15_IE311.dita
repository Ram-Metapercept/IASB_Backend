This is on the basis of the entity’s customary business practice to undertake activities that support and maintain the value of the name and logo such as continuing to play and providing a competitive team. The entity determines that the ability of the customer to obtain benefit from the name and logo is substantially derived from, or dependent upon, the expected activities of the entity. In addition, the entity observes that because some of its consideration is dependent on the success of the customer (through the sales-based royalty), the entity has a shared economic interest with the customer, which indicates that the customer will expect the entity to undertake those activities to maximise earnings.</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2013" base="F49800551" class="- topic/p ">the entity observes that the rights granted by the licence (ie the use of the team’s name and logo) directly expose the customer to any positive or negative effects of the entity’s activities.</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2014" base="F49800553" class="- topic/p ">the entity also observes that even though the customer may benefit from the activities through the rights granted by the licence, they do not transfer a good or service to the customer as those activities occur.</p></li></ol></variant></body></paragraph>
