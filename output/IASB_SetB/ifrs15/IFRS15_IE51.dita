In reaching this determination, the entity considers that, although it integrates the software into the customer’s system, the installation services do not significantly affect the customer’s ability to use and benefit from the software licence because the installation services are routine and can be obtained from alternative providers. The software updates do not significantly affect the customer’s ability to use and benefit from the software licence during the licence period. The entity further observes that none of the promised goods or services significantly modify or customise one another, nor is the entity providing a significant service of integrating the software and the services into a combined output. Lastly, the entity concludes that the software and the services do not significantly affect each other and, therefore, are not highly interdependent or highly interrelated, because the entity would be able to fulfil its promise to transfer the initial software licence independently from its promise to subsequently provide the installation service, software updates or technical support.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
