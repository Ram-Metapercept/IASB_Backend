The entity provides the significant integration service necessary to produce the specialised equipment and, therefore, controls the specialised equipment before it is transferred to the customer. The entity directs the use of the supplier’s manufacturing service as an input in creating the combined output that is the specialised equipment. In reaching the conclusion that it controls the specialised equipment before that equipment is transferred to the customer, the entity also observes that, even though the supplier delivers the specialised equipment to the customer, the supplier has no ability to direct its use (ie the terms of the contract between the entity and the supplier preclude the supplier from using the specialised equipment for another purpose or directing that equipment to another customer). The entity also obtains the remaining benefits from the specialised equipment by being entitled to the consideration in the contract from the customer.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
