If the entity were to be unable to satisfy its obligation and the customer hired another consulting firm to provide the opinion, the other consulting firm would need to substantially re‑perform the work that the entity had completed to date, because the other consulting firm would not have the benefit of any work in progress performed by the entity. The nature of the professional opinion is such that the customer will receive the benefits of the entity’s performance only when the customer receives the professional opinion. Consequently, the entity concludes that the criterion in paragraph 35(a) of IFRS 15 is not met.</p></body></paragraph>
