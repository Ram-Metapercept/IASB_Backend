The entity does not consider in its assessment of the criteria in paragraph B58 of IFRS 15 the promise to provide software updates, because they result in the transfer of an additional good or service to the customer (see paragraph B58(c)). The entity also observes that it does not have any contractual or implied obligations (independent of the updates and technical support) to undertake activities that will change the functionality of the software during the licence period. The entity observes that the software remains functional without the updates and the technical support and, therefore, the ability of the customer to obtain the benefits of the software is not substantially derived from, or dependent on, the entity’s ongoing activities. The entity therefore determines that the contract does not require, and the customer does not reasonably expect, the entity to undertake activities that significantly affect the software (independent of the updates and technical support). The entity concludes that the software to which the licence relates has significant stand‑alone functionality and none of the criteria in paragraph B58 of IFRS 15 are met. The entity further concludes that the nature of the entity’s promise in transferring the licence is to provide a right to use the entity’s intellectual property as it exists at a point in time. Consequently, the entity accounts for the licence as a performance obligation satisfied at a point in time.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
