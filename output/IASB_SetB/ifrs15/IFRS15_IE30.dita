The entity concludes that the change in estimate of the variable consideration can be included in the transaction price, because it is highly probable that a significant reversal in cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Even though the modification was accounted for as if it were the termination of the existing contract and the creation of a new contract in accordance with <xref href="IFRS15_21.dita#IFRS15_21" id="IFRS15_X1157" base="F33216766" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 21(a) of IFRS 15</xref>, the increase in the transaction price of CU40 is attributable to variable consideration promised before the modification. Therefore, in accordance with <xref href="IFRS15_90.dita#IFRS15_90" id="IFRS15_X1158" base="F33216767" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 90 of IFRS 15</xref>, the change in the transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations for Product X and Product Y on the same basis as at contract inception. Consequently, the entity recognises revenue of CU20 for Product X in the period in which the change in the transaction price occurs. Because Product Y had not transferred to the customer before the contract modification, the change in the transaction price that is attributable to Product Y is allocated to the remaining performance obligations at the time of the contract modification. This is consistent with the accounting that would have been required by paragraph 21(a) of IFRS 15 if that amount of variable consideration had been estimated and included in the transaction price at the time of the contract modification.</p></body></paragraph>
