In addition, the entity concludes that the promise to grant the licence and the promise to transfer the equipment are each distinct. This is because the customer can benefit from each good or service (ie the licence and the equipment) on its own or together with other resources that are readily available (see <xref href="IFRS15_27.dita#IFRS15_27" id="IFRS15_X1506" base="F49541570" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 27(a) of IFRS 15</xref>). The customer can benefit from the licence together with the equipment that is delivered before the opening of the franchise and the equipment can be used in the franchise or sold for an amount other than scrap value. The entity also determines that the promises to grant the franchise licence and to transfer the equipment are separately identifiable, in accordance with the criterion in <xref href="IFRS15_27.dita#IFRS15_27" id="IFRS15_X1507" base="F49541571" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 27(b) of IFRS 15</xref>. The entity concludes that the licence and the equipment are not inputs to a combined item (ie they are not fulfilling what is, in effect, a single promise to the customer). In reaching this conclusion, the entity considers that it is not providing a significant service of integrating the licence and the equipment into a combined item (ie the licensed intellectual property is not a component of, and does not significantly modify, the equipment). In addition, the licence and the equipment are not highly interdependent or highly interrelated because the entity would be able to fulfil each promise (ie to license the franchise or to transfer the equipment) independently of the other. Consequently, the entity has two performance obligations:</p> <ol outputclass="static" id="IFRS15_L0140" base="F49541573" type="lower-alpha" class="- topic/ol "><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P1963" base="F49541575" class="- topic/p ">the franchise licence; and</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P1964" base="F49541577" class="- topic/p ">the equipment.</p></li></ol></variant></body></paragraph>
