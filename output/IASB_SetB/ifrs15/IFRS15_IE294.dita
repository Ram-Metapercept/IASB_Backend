The ability of the customer to obtain benefit from the intellectual property to which the customer has rights is substantially derived from, or dependent upon, the expected activities of the entity. This is on the basis of the entity’s customary business practice to undertake activities such as analysing the consumers’ changing preferences and implementing product improvements, pricing strategies, marketing campaigns and operational efficiencies. In addition, the entity observes that because part of its compensation is dependent on the success of the franchisee (as evidenced through the sales-based royalty), the entity has a shared economic interest with the customer that indicates that the customer will expect the entity to undertake those activities to maximise earnings.</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P1975" base="F49800398" class="- topic/p ">the entity also observes that the franchise licence requires the customer to implement any changes that result from those activities and thus exposes the customer to any positive or negative effects of those activities.</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P1976" base="F49800400" class="- topic/p ">the entity also observes that even though the customer may benefit from the activities through the rights granted by the licence, they do not transfer a good or service to the customer as those activities occur.</p></li></ol></variant></body></paragraph>
