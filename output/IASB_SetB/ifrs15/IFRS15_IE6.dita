The entity observes that none of the events described in paragraph 15 have occurred—that is, the entity has not received substantially all of the consideration and it has not terminated the contract. Consequently, in accordance with paragraph 16, the entity accounts for the non-refundable CU50,000 payment as a deposit liability. The entity continues to account for the initial deposit, as well as any future payments of principal and interest, as a deposit liability, until such time that the entity concludes that the criteria in paragraph 9 are met (ie the entity is able to conclude that it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration) or one of the events in paragraph 15 has occurred.
