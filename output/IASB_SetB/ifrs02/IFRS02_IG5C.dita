For example, an entity might be required by government legislation to issue some portion of its shares to nationals of a particular country that may be transferred only to other nationals of that country. Such a transfer restriction may affect the fair value of the shares concerned, and therefore those shares may have a fair value that is less than the fair value of otherwise identical shares that do not carry such restrictions. In this situation, the phrase ‘the fair value of the share‑based payment’ would refer to the fair value of the restricted shares, not the fair value of other, unrestricted shares.</p></body></paragraph>
