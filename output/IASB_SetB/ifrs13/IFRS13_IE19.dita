An entity enters into transactions in both markets  and can access  the price in those markets for the asset at the measurement date. In Market A, the price that would be received is CU26, transaction costs  in that market  are CU3 and the costs to transport the asset to that market are CU2 (ie the net amount that would be received is CU21). In Market B, the price that would be received is CU25, transaction costs in that market are CU1 and the costs to transport the asset to that market are CU2 (ie the net amount that would be received in Market B is CU22).</p></body></paragraph>
