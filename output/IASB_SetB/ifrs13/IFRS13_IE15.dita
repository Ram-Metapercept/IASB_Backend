The asset group includes an income‑producing software asset internally developed for licensing to customers and its complementary assets (including a related database with which the software asset is used) and the associated liabilities. To allocate the cost of the group to the individual assets acquired, the entity measures the fair value of the software asset. The entity determines that the software asset would provide maximum value to market participants  through its use in combination with other assets or with other assets and liabilities (ie its complementary assets and the associated liabilities ). There is no evidence to suggest that the current use of the software asset is not its highest and best use . Therefore, the highest and best use of the software asset is its current use. (In this case the licensing of the software asset, in and of itself, does not indicate that the fair value of the asset would be maximised through its use by market participants on a stand‑alone basis. )</p></body></paragraph>
