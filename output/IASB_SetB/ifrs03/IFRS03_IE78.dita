In particular, the scale of operations and risks associated with the two classes of customers are significantly different. Consequently, the fair value of the gross assets acquired is not substantially all concentrated in a group of similar identifiable assets, because the fair value of the office park is similar to the aggregate fair value of the 10 single-family homes. Thus Purchaser assesses whether the set meets the minimum requirements to be considered a business in accordance with <xref href="IFRS03_gB8-B11.dita" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs B8–B12D</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
