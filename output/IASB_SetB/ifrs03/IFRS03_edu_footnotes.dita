The Interpretations         Committee concluded that, regardless of the level of monetary or non-monetary assets owned         by the non-listed operating entity, the entire difference should be considered to be         payment for a service of a stock exchange listing for its shares, and that no amount         should be considered a cost of raising capital.

More specifically, the           submitter is seeking clarification of whether an acquirer identified for the purpose of           IFRS 3 (as revised in 2008) is a parent for the purpose of IFRS 10 in circumstances in           which a business combination is achieved by contract alone, such as a stapling           arrangement, with no combining entity obtaining control of the other combining           entities.</p>         <p class="- topic/p ">IFRS 3 (as revised in 2008) defines a business combination as “a transaction or other           event in which an acquirer obtains control of one or more businesses”. In addition, IFRS 3           (as revised in 2008) refers to IFRS 10 for the meaning of the term ‘control’. IFRS 10           states that an investor controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to           variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect           those returns through its power over the investee. Hence, the Interpretations Committee           observed that an investment is not needed in order for an entity to control another           entity.</p>         <p class="- topic/p ">The definition of a business combination in IFRS 3 (as revised in 2008) includes           transactions in which an acquirer obtains control of one or more businesses. It also           includes transactions that are sometimes referred to as ‘true mergers’ or ‘mergers of           equals’. In other words, it includes transactions in which none of the combining entities           obtains control of the other combining entities. The Interpretations Committee discussed a           stapling arrangement and noted that if the stapling arrangement combines separate entities           and businesses by the unification of ownership and voting interests in the combining           entities, then such a transaction is a business combination as defined by IFRS 3 (as           revised in 2008).</p>         <p class="- topic/p ">Notwithstanding the fact that IFRS 3 (as revised in 2008) includes business combinations           in which none of the combining entities obtains control of the other combining entities,           the Interpretations Committee noted that paragraph 6 of IFRS 3 (as revised in 2008)           requires that one of the combining entities in a business combination must be identified           as the acquirer. Paragraphs B14–B18 of IFRS 3 (as revised in 2008) provide additional           guidance for identifying the acquirer if the guidance in IFRS 10 does not clearly indicate           which combining entity is the acquirer.</p>         <p class="- topic/p ">The Interpretations Committee also noted that paragraph B15(a) of IFRS 3 (as revised in           2008) provides guidance on identifying the acquirer by assessing the relative voting           rights in the combined entity after the combination—this guidance explains that the           acquirer is usually the combining entity whose owners, as a group, receive the largest           portion of the voting rights in the combined entity. This guidance is consistent with the           Interpretations Committee’s observation that the definition of a business combination           includes transactions in which none of the combining entities or businesses are identified           as having control of the other combining entities. The Interpretations Committee thought           that this guidance would be relevant to identifying which of the combining entities is the           acquirer in the stapling transaction considered.</p>         <p class="- topic/p ">The Interpretations Committee noted that the IASB stated in the IASB Update for September           2004 that the intended interaction between IFRS 3 (issued in 2004) and <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_number" class="- topic/ph ">IAS 27</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Consolidated and Separate Financial           Statements</ph></ph> is that an entity that is identified as the ‘acquirer’ of another           entity in accordance with IFRS 3 (issued in 2004) is a ‘parent’ for the purposes of           IAS 27. The Interpretations Committee noted that the meaning of the term ‘acquirer’ has           not changed since 2004 and that the term ‘control’ is used consistently between IFRS 3 (as           revised in 2008) and IFRS 10. It also noted that the notion in IFRS 3 (as revised in 2008)           that a business combination could occur even if none of the combining entities obtains           control of the other combining entities has not changed from IFRS 3 (issued in 2004).           Accordingly, the Interpretations Committee observed that the IASB’s statement on the           interaction between IFRS 3 (issued in 2004) and IAS 27 remains valid in respect of the           interaction between IFRS 3 (as revised in 2008) and IFRS 10. Consequently, the           Interpretations Committee observed that the combining entity in the stapling arrangement           that is identified as the acquirer for the purpose of IFRS 3 (as revised in 2008) should           prepare consolidated financial statements of the combined entity in accordance with           IFRS 10.</p>         <p class="- topic/p ">The Interpretations Committee noted that there is little diversity in practice for the           accounting for business combinations achieved by contract alone. It further noted that it           does not expect diversity to emerge in the future on the basis of the analysis on the           requirements and guidance in IFRS 3 (as revised in 2008) and IFRS 10. </p>         <p class="- topic/p ">Accordingly, the Interpretations Committee decided not to add this issue to its           agenda.]</p>       </fn><fn base="IFRS03_g39-40" id="IFRS03_FN0011" class="- topic/fn ">         <p id="IFRS03_P2816" class="- topic/p ">[IFRIC® <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">Update</i>, November 2006, Agenda Decision, ‘<ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_number" class="- topic/ph ">IFRS 3</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Business Combinations</ph></ph>—Are puts or forwards           received by minority interests in a business combination contingent consideration?’</p>         <p class="- topic/p ">The IFRIC considered a request for an interpretation of whether a put or forward entered           into by a parent entity, as part of a business combination, to acquire the shares held by           the [non‑controlling] minority interest was contingent or deferred consideration.</p>         <p class="- topic/p ">The accounting for these arrangements, including the circumstances considered by the           IFRIC, was being considered by the Board as part of the current redeliberations on the           proposed revised IFRS 3.

Therefore, except for costs to           issue debt or equity securities that are recognised in accordance with IAS 32 and IAS 39,           the revised IFRS 3 requires an entity to account for acquisition‑related costs as expenses           in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received.

IFRS 3 (as revised in 2008) requires an acquirer to recognise the           identifiable intangible assets of the acquiree separately from goodwill. An intangible           asset is identifiable if it meets either the contractual‑legal criterion or the separable           criterion in <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_number" class="- topic/ph ">IAS 38</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Intangible Assets</ph></ph>.

The           question arose because the submitter asserted that paragraph B55 introduces subparagraphs           (a)–(h) as indicators, but paragraph B55(a) uses conclusive language stating that the           arrangement described is remuneration for post-combination services.</p>         <p class="- topic/p ">The Interpretations Committee observed that an arrangement in which contingent payments           are automatically forfeited if employment terminates would lead to a conclusion that the           arrangement is compensation for post-combination services rather than additional           consideration for an acquisition, unless the service condition is not substantive.
