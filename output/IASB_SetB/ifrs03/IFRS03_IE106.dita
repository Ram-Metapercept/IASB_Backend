Consequently, Purchaser applies the criteria in <xref href="IFRS03_B12C.dita" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph B12C</xref>. As explained in <xref href="IFRS03_B12D.dita" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph B12D(a)</xref>, acquired contracts are an input and not a substantive process. Purchaser considers next whether the acquired supply contract provides access to an organised workforce that performs a substantive process. Because the supply contract is not providing a service that applies a process to another acquired input, Purchaser concludes that the substance of the supply contract is only that of buying Product X, without acquiring the organised workforce, processes and other inputs needed to produce Product X. Furthermore, the acquired sublicence is an input, not a process. Purchaser concludes that the set is not a business because it does not include an organised workforce and Purchaser has acquired no substantive process that could meet the criteria in <xref href="IFRS03_B12C.dita" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph B12C</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
