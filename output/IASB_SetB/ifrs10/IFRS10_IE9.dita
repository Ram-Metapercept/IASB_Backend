Real Estate Entity typically holds its property in separate wholly‑owned subsidiaries, which have no other substantial assets or liabilities other than borrowings used to finance the related investment property. Real Estate Entity and each of its subsidiaries report their investment properties at fair value in accordance with IAS 40 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Investment Property</ph></ph>. Real Estate Entity does not have a set time frame for disposing of its property investments, but uses fair value to help identify the optimal time for disposal. Although fair value is one performance indicator, Real Estate Entity and its investors use other measures, including information about expected cash flows, rental revenues and expenses, to assess performance and to make investment decisions. The key management personnel of Real Estate Entity do not consider fair value information to be the primary measurement attribute to evaluate the performance of its investments but rather a part of a group of equally relevant key performance indicators.</p></body></paragraph>
