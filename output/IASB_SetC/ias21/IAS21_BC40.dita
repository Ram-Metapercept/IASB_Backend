As a consequence, the Board concluded that when an entity loses joint control of a joint arrangement that includes a foreign operation but retains significant influence, an entity reclassifies to profit or loss only the proportionate share of the cumulative amount of the exchange differences recognised in other comprehensive income relating to a foreign operation in that joint arrangement. </p></body></paragraph>
