If it were, the Board thought that the entity should be required to recalibrate the accounting as required by <xref href="../ifrs10/IFRS10_TOC.dita#IFRS10_TOC0001" base="F16452993" id="IAS21_X0231" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 10 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Consolidated Financial Statements</ph></ph></xref>. However, the Board concluded that, although significant, the events are fundamentally different. In the case of loss of control, the cessation of the parent‑subsidiary relationship results in the derecognition of assets and liabilities because the composition of the group changes. If joint control or significant influence is lost the composition of the group is unaffected.</p></body></paragraph>
