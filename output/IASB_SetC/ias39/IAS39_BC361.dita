For example, an entity may first make changes required by the reform to a derivative designated as a hedging instrument, while only making changes required by the reform to the financial instrument designated as the hedged item later. In applying the amendments, the entity would be required to amend the hedge documentation to amend the description of the hedging instrument. The hedge documentation of the hedging relationship would then have to be amended again to change the description of the hedged item and/or hedged risk as required in <xref href="IAS39_102P.dita" scope="local" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 102P of IAS 39</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
