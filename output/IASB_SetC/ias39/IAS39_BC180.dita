As a result, an entity would not be required to compute the effect that a change in interest rates has on the fair value of the prepayment option embedded in a prepayable item. Instead, it could incorporate the effect of a change in interest rates on prepayments by grouping the hedged portfolio into repricing time periods based on expected repayment dates. The Board noted that this approach has significant practical advantages for preparers of financial statements, because it allows them to use the data they use for risk management. The Board also noted that the approach is consistent with <xref href="IAS39_81.dita#IAS39_81" id="IAS39_X1843" base="F16154295" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 81 of IAS 39</xref>, which permits hedge accounting for a portion of a financial asset or financial liability. However, as discussed further in <xref href="IAS39_BC193.dita#IAS39_BC193" id="IAS39_X1844" base="F16154296" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC193–BC206</xref>, the Board also concluded that if the entity changes its estimates of the time periods in which items are expected to repay (eg in the light of recent prepayment experience), ineffectiveness will arise, regardless of whether the revision in estimates results in more or less being scheduled in a particular time period.</p></body></paragraph>
