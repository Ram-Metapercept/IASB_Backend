Furthermore, the Board noted that the risk of allowing hedge accounting to be applied for hedging relationships that would not otherwise qualify for hedge accounting is mitigated by the required prospective assessment as only the uncertainty arising from the reform is excluded from that assessment. Any other sources of ineffectiveness would continue to be included in the assessment of whether the hedge is expected to be highly effective in future periods. The Board noted that any high level of ineffectiveness arising in a hedging relationship is expected to be captured by the prospective assessment. The Board also noted that all ineffectiveness would be recognised and measured and thus be transparent in financial reporting. The Board, therefore, decided to provide an exception from the requirement to discontinue hedge accounting as a result of <xref href="IAS39_88.dita#IAS39_88" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 88(e) of <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_number" class="- topic/ph ">IAS 39</ph></ph></xref> because the actual results of the hedge do not meet the requirements in <xref href="IAS39_AG105.dita" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph AG105(b) of <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_number" class="- topic/ph ">IAS 39</ph></ph></xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
