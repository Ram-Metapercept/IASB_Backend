The Board decided that, in the context of a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk, these requirements could be inconsistent with the Board’s decision, set out in the previous paragraph, on how to incorporate the effects of prepayment risk. Accordingly, the Board decided that they should not apply. Instead, the financial assets or financial liabilities included in a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk need only share the risk being hedged.</p></body></paragraph>
