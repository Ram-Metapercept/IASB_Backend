For example, if the outcome of the reform affects the market structure of an interest rate benchmark, it could affect an entity’s assessment of whether a non-contractually specified LIBOR portion is separately identifiable and, therefore, an eligible hedged item in a hedging relationship. The Board considered only those designated portions that are implicit in the fair value or the cash flows of an item of which they are a part (referred to as non-contractually specified) because the same issue does not arise for designated portions that are explicitly specified in the contract. </p></body></paragraph>
