Furthermore, IAS 39 permits hedge accounting to be applied to transactions between entities in the same group in the <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">separate reporting</i> of those entities. However, IAS 39 does not permit hedge accounting for transactions between entities in the same group in consolidated financial statements. The reason is the fundamental requirement of consolidation that the accounting effects of internal contracts should be eliminated in consolidated financial statements, including any internally generated gains or losses. Designating internal contracts as hedging instruments could result in non‑elimination of internal gains and losses and have other accounting effects. The Exposure Draft did not propose any change in this area.</p></body></paragraph>
