Although the Board has not yet considered the broader issue of what costs may be capitalised at initial recognition, the Board believes that its decision to provide an option for basis adjustments in the case of non‑financial items will not pre‑empt that future discussion. The Board also recognised that financial items and non‑financial items are not necessarily measured at the same amount on initial recognition, because financial items are measured at fair value and non‑financial items are measured at cost.</p></body></paragraph>
