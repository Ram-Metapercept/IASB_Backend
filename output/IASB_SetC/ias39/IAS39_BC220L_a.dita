For example, in order to enter into a derivative with a CCP it may be necessary to make adjustments to the collateral arrangements. Such narrow changes that are a direct consequence of or are incidental to the novation were acknowledged in the proposed amendments. However, this would not include changes to, for example, the maturity of the derivatives, the payment dates, or the contractual cash flows or the basis of their calculation, except for charges that may arise as a consequence of transacting with a CCP.</p></body></paragraph>
