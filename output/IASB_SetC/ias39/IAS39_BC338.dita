The Board acknowledged that this approach is an exception to the hedge accounting requirements in IAS 39 because other hedge accounting requirements, including the requirements in <xref href="IAS39_89.dita" scope="local" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs 89</xref> and <xref href="IAS39_96.dita" scope="local" class="- topic/xref ">96 of IAS 39</xref>, are applied to the hedging relationship in its entirety. However, in the Board’s view, the robustness of the hedge accounting requirements is maintained because if any subgroup fails to meet the requirements in paragraphs 78 and 83 of IAS 39, the entity is required to discontinue hedge accounting for that entire hedging relationship. The Board concluded this accounting outcome is appropriate because the basis for designating the hedged item on a group basis is that the entity is managing the designated hedge for the group as a whole.</p></body></paragraph>
