However, the Board concluded that an entity is likely to have such information available because IAS 39 already requires it to identify and document hedged items designated within a hedging relationship with sufficient specificity. Therefore, the Board concluded that the benefits of avoiding the discontinuation of hedge accounting and the resulting accounting impacts outweigh the associated costs of this exception.</p></body></paragraph>
