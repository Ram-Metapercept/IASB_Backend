However, the Board decided that to avoid the complexity of detailed judgements during the 24-month period, an entity is required to cease applying the requirement during the 24-month period if, and only if, the entity reasonably expects that the alternative benchmark rate will not meet the separately identifiable requirement within that period. If an entity reasonably expects that an alternative benchmark rate will not be separately identifiable within 24 months from the date the entity designates it as a non-contractually specified risk portion for the first time, the entity is required to cease applying the requirement in <xref href="IAS39_102Z1.dita" scope="local" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 102Z1 of IAS 39</xref> to that alternative benchmark rate and discontinue applying hedge accounting prospectively from the date of that reassessment to all hedging relationships in which the alternative benchmark rate was designated as a non-contractually specified risk portion.</p></body></paragraph>
