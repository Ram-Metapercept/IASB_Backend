Therefore it decided that ineffectiveness should be calculated by determining the change in the estimated amount in a repricing time period between one date on which effectiveness is measured and the next, as described more fully in <xref href="IAS39_AG126.dita#IAS39_AG126" id="IAS39_X1865" base="F16154478" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs AG126 and AG127</xref>. This requires the entity to track how much of the change in each repricing time period between these two dates is attributable to revisions in estimates and how much is attributable to the origination of new assets (or liabilities). However, once ineffectiveness has been determined as set out above, the entity in essence starts again, ie it establishes the new amount in each repricing time period (including new items that have been originated since it last tested effectiveness), designates a new hedged item, and repeats the procedures to determine ineffectiveness at the next date it tests effectiveness. Thus the tracking is limited to movements between one date when effectiveness is measured and the next. It is not necessary to track for multiple periods. However, the entity will need to keep records relating to each repricing time period (a) to reconcile the amounts for each repricing time period with the total amounts in the two separate line items in the balance sheet (see <xref href="IAS39_AG114.dita#IAS39_AG114" id="IAS39_X1866" base="F16154479" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph AG114(f)</xref>), and (b) to ensure that amounts in the two separate line items are derecognised no later than when the repricing time period to which they relate expires.</p></body></paragraph>
