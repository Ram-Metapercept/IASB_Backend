The objective of the reform is to       cease the publication of the current interest rate benchmark and replace it with an       alternative benchmark rate. As part of the reform, the administrator introduces an interim       benchmark rate and determines a fixed spread adjustment based on the difference between the       interim benchmark rate and the current interest rate benchmark. Uncertainty about the timing       or the amount of the alternative benchmark rate-based cash flows will not be eliminated during       the interim period because the interim benchmark rate (including the fixed spread adjustment       determined by the administrator) represent an interim measure in progressing towards the       reform but it does not represent the alternative benchmark rate (or any related spread       adjustment agreed between parties to the contract).</p></body></paragraph>
