Applying <xref href="IAS39_102M.dita" scope="local" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 102M of IAS 39</xref>, an entity is required to cease applying this exception when the uncertainty is no longer present with respect to the hedged risk and the timing and the amount of the interest rate benchmark-based cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument, unless the hedging relationship is discontinued before that date. As with the other Phase 1 amendments, at the date the exception in paragraph 102G of IAS 39 ceases to apply, an entity must apply the requirements in IAS 39 (as amended by the Phase 2 amendments). Therefore, at that time, an entity would apply paragraph AG105(b) of IAS 39 to assess whether the actual results of the hedge are within a range of 80â€“125 per cent and, if the results are outside that range, discontinue hedge accounting.</p></body></paragraph>
