But the clause does not specify       those conditions. In this case, the uncertainty regarding the timing and the amount of the       interest rate benchmark-based cash flows for this contract has not been eliminated by       including this clause in the contract. Uncertainty regarding both the timing and the amount of       cash flows for this contract will be present until the central authority specifies when the       replacement of the benchmark will become effective and what the alternative benchmark rate and       any related spread adjustment will be.</p></body></paragraph>
