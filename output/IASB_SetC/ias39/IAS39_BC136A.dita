The Board was persuaded that the concern described in the previous paragraph that an entity might deliberately underhedge would be met by an explicit statement that an entity could not deliberately hedge less than 100 per cent of the exposure on an item and designate the hedge as a hedge of 100 per cent of the exposure. Therefore, the Board decided to amend IAS 39: </p><ol outputclass="static" id="IAS39_L0163" base="SL135592" type="lower-alpha" class="- topic/ol "><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(a)</li_value> <p id="IAS39_P5406" base="SL135594" class="- topic/p ">to remove the words ‘almost fully offset’ from the prospective effectiveness test, and replace them by a requirement that the hedge is expected to be ‘highly effective’.
