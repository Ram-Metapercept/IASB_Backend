That is because these amendments would apply only when the conditions in <xref href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_5.4.7.dita" scope="local" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 5.4.7 of IFRS 9</xref> are met, which require that changes are made on an economically equivalent basis. The Board acknowledged these comments noting that, applying <xref href="IAS39_102P.dita" scope="local" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 102P of IAS 39</xref>, a significant change in fair value arising from the remeasurement of the hedged item or the hedging instrument indicates  that the changes were not made on an economically equivalent basis. Furthermore, the Board observed that the requirement in <xref href="IAS39_102P.dita" scope="local" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 102P(b) of IAS 39</xref> which requires the description of the designated portion for the cash flows or fair value being hedged enables entities to amend a hedging relationship to minimise fair value changes on the remeasurement of the hedged item or the hedging instrument.</p></body></paragraph>
