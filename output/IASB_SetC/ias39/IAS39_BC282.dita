The Board noted that <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_number" class="- topic/ph ">IAS 39</ph></ph> requires an entity to identify and       document a forecast transaction with sufficient specificity so that, when the transaction       occurs, the entity is able to determine whether the transaction is the hedged transaction. For       example, if an entity designates a future issuance of a LIBOR-based debt instrument as the       hedged item, although there may be no contract at the time of designation, the hedge       documentation would refer specifically to LIBOR. Consequently, the Board concluded that       entities should be able to identify when the uncertainty regarding the timing and the amount       of the resulting cash flows of a forecast transaction is no longer present. </p></body></paragraph>
