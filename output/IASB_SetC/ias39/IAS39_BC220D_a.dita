The IASB noted that the novation to the CCP would release Party A from the responsibility to make payments to Party B and also would oblige Party A to make payments to the CCP. Consequently, the original derivative through which Party A has transacted with Party B also meets the derecognition criteria for a financial liability.<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS39_FN0143" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/></p></body></paragraph>
