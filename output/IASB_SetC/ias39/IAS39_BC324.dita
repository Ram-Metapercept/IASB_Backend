For example, this could be the case when there is market volatility during the initial period following the transition to an alternative benchmark rate. Such volatility could cause the retrospective effectiveness assessment to breach the 80-125 per cent threshold because an entity would be precluded from assessing effectiveness based on data prior to the reset date even if that data would show that the hedging relationship actually is effective over a longer time horizon. The Board agreed with these comments and therefore, amended <xref href="IAS39_102V.dita" scope="local" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 102V of IAS 39</xref> so that it permits, rather than requires, entities (ie entities may elect) to reset to zero the cumulative fair value changes for the purpose of assessing the retrospective effectiveness of a hedging relationship on a cumulative basis. Considering the nature of this amendment, the Board decided this election is made on an individual hedging relationship basis.</p></body></paragraph>
