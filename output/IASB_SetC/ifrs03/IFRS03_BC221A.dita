The Board decided to limit the choice to non‑controlling interests that are present ownership instruments and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the entity’s net assets in the event of liquidation. The amendment requires the acquirer to measure all other components of non‑controlling interest at the acquisition‑date fair value, unless IFRSs require another measurement basis. For example, if a share‑based payment transaction is classified as equity, an entity measures it in accordance with <xref href="../ifrs02/IFRS02_TOC.dita#IFRS02_TOC0001" base="F16122553" id="IFRS03_X1361" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 2 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Share‑based Payment</ph></ph></xref>. Without this amendment, if the acquirer chose to measure non‑controlling interest at its proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets, the acquirer might have measured some equity instruments at nil. In the Board’s view, this would result in not recognising economic interests that other parties have in the acquiree. Therefore, the Board amended <xref href="IFRS03_TOC.dita#IFRS03_TOC0001" base="F16122554" id="IFRS03_X1362" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 3</xref> to limit the scope of the measurement choice.</p></body></paragraph>
