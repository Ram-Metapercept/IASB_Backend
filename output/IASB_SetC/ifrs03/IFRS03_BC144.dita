The boards considered whether to require, for example, the separate recognition of an asset acquired for an acquiree’s rights to use property for the specified period and related renewal options or other rights and a liability assumed for an acquiree’s obligations to make required lease payments for an operating lease acquired in a business combination. However, at the time they considered how to account for operating leases in a business combination, they were considering adding to their agendas a joint project on accounting for leases. That project was added in 2006. Accordingly, the boards concluded that the revised standards should be consistent with the existing accounting requirements on accounting for leases. Therefore, the revised standards provide that the acquirer recognises no assets or liabilities related to an operating lease in which the acquiree is the lessee other than those referred to in <xref href="IFRS03_B28-B30_DELETED.dita#IFRS03_B28_B30/IFRS03_B28_B30" base="F16122378" scope="local" id="IFRS03_X1314" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs B29 and B30</xref> of the revised IFRS 3, which are discussed in the following paragraphs.</p><variants id="IFRS03_E0147" class="+ topic/bodydiv ifrs-d/variants ">            </variants></body></paragraph>
