The boards concluded that it was not feasible to require all employee benefit obligations assumed in a business combination to be measured at their acquisition‑date fair values. To do so would effectively require the boards to reconsider comprehensively the relevant standards for those employee benefits as a part of their business combinations projects. Given the complexities in accounting for employee benefit obligations in accordance with existing requirements, the boards decided that the only practicable alternative is to require those obligations, and any related assets, to be measured in accordance with their applicable standards.</p></body></paragraph>
