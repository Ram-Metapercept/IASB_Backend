For example, outstanding shares of the parent company, including shares issued to former owners of an acquiree to effect a business combination, were measured in the financial statements at their fair value (market price) on the date they were issued. Accordingly, the fair value measurement principle in SFAS 141(R) applies to a non‑controlling interest in an acquiree, and the revised IFRS 3 permits an acquirer to measure a non‑controlling interest in an acquiree at its acquisition‑date fair value.</p></body></paragraph>
