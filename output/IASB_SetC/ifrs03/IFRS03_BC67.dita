Many of those constituents reiterated public policy concerns similar to those discussed in <xref href="IFRS03_gBC49-BC52.dita#IFRS03_gBC49_BC52" id="IFRS03_X1271" base="F16122190" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC49–BC52</xref>. For example, some said that eliminating the pooling method could impede desirable combinations and reduce the amount of capital flowing into their industries. They suggested, for example, that the requirement to identify an acquirer could impede mergers of neighbouring mutual entities when both the fact and appearance of a merger of equals are of paramount importance to their directors, members and communities. The boards did not find those arguments persuasive for the same reasons discussed in <xref href="IFRS03_gBC49-BC52.dita#IFRS03_gBC49_BC52" id="IFRS03_X1272" base="F16122221" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC49–BC52</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
