The objective of that project was to develop guidance for combinations of two or more mutual entities. In October 2001 the FASB and the AcSB held a round‑table discussion with representatives of mutual banks, credit unions, co‑operatives and other mutual entities. In January 2004 the FASB met representatives of organisations of co‑operative and other mutual entities to discuss its tentative conclusions and specific concerns raised by constituents. In addition, the FASB conducted field visits to three mutual entities in 2004.</p></body></paragraph>
