Thus, because goodwill is measured as a residual, the amount recognised for a non‑controlling interest in an acquiree would also have been a residual. Also, an important issue in deciding how to measure a non‑controlling interest was whether its share of goodwill should be recognised (often referred to as the ‘full goodwill versus partial goodwill issue’). In developing the 2005 Exposure Draft, the boards concluded that it should be recognised (in other words, they selected the ‘full goodwill’ alternative).</p></body></paragraph>
