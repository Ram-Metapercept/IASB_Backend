Therefore, liabilities for contingent payments that are not derivative instruments should also be remeasured at fair value after the acquisition date. The boards concluded that applying those provisions would faithfully represent the fair value of the liability for the contingent payment of consideration that remains a liability until settled.</p></body></paragraph>
