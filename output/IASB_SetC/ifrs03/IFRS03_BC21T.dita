To address these concerns, in the 2018 Amendments the       Board added a concentration test that is designed to reduce cost and complexity       by avoiding the need for a detailed assessment in some circumstances. If       substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a       single identifiable asset, or group of similar identifiable assets, the concentration test is met and the set of activities and assets is considered not to       be a business. If the concentration test is met, no further assessment is needed.</p></body></paragraph>
