When this occurs, the acquirer may choose to grant a new award to those employees voluntarily. The new award granted in such circumstances can only be for future services, because the acquirer has no obligation to the employees in respect of past services that they provided to the acquiree. Accordingly, <xref href="IFRS03_B56.dita#IFRS03_B56" base="F16122833" id="IFRS03_X1436" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph B56</xref> requires the whole of the market‑based value of the new award to be accounted for as a post‑combination expense, which is recognised in accordance with <xref href="../ifrs02/IFRS02_TOC.dita#IFRS02_TOC0001" base="F16122834" id="IFRS03_X1437" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 2</xref>. This accounting treatment is different from that required in circumstances when the employee share‑based payment award does not expire in the event of a business combination. When an unexpired award is replaced by the acquirer, part of the market‑based value of the replacement award reflects the acquiree’s obligation that remains outstanding at the date of the business combination, and is accounted for as part of the consideration transferred in the business combination. The balance of the market‑based value of the replacement award is accounted for as a post‑combination expense for the services to be received over the period to when the replacement award vests, in accordance with IFRS 2. The accounting for the replacement of unexpired awards is the same for awards that are replaced voluntarily by the acquirer and those that the acquirer is obliged to replace because the substance is the same in both circumstances.</p></body></paragraph>
