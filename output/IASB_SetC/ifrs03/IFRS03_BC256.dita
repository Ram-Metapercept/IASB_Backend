However, the boards observed that entities that apply <xref href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001" base="F19767920" id="IFRS03_X1386" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 39</xref><xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS03_FN0056" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/> are required to measure financial assets acquired outside a business combination, as well as those originated, at fair value on initial recognition. The boards do not think financial or other assets should be measured differently because of the nature of the transaction in which they are acquired. Because the boards saw no compelling reason to provide an exception to the measurement principle for receivables or other assets with credit risk, they affirmed their conclusion that the benefits of measuring receivables and similar assets at fair value justify the related costs.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
