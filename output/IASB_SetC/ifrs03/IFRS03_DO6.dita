Professor Barth and Mr Smith strongly support that goal. The Board’s decision to make the exception to the measurement principle for non‑controlling interests creates a divergence from SFAS 141(R). Both the FASB and the IASB made compromises to achieve a converged result in other aspects of the IFRS, and the FASB made a number of changes to its standard that conform to IFRS 3 (as issued in 2004). Professor Barth and Mr Smith believe that the Board’s compromise on this particular issue diminishes the importance of convergence, establishes a precedent for allowing a choice when the two boards cannot reach agreement and may suggest that full convergence in the long term cannot be achieved. This is particularly concerning for this decision given that the Board supports the principle underlying the FASB’s answer, there are comparability costs inherent in a free choice of accounting methods and there are likely to be few benefits arising from the exception.</p></body></paragraph>
