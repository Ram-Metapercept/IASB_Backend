Consistently with that change, the boards also eliminated the presumption in the 2005 Exposure Draft that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the acquisition‑date fair value of the consideration transferred is the best evidence of the fair value of the acquirer’s interest in the acquiree at that date. Therefore, the revised standards describe the measurement of goodwill in terms of the recognised amount of the consideration transferred—generally its acquisition‑date fair value (<xref href="IFRS03_32.dita#IFRS03_32" id="IFRS03_X1443" base="F16122868" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 32 of the revised IFRS 3</xref>)—and specify how to measure goodwill if the fair value of the acquiree is more reliably measurable than the fair value of the consideration transferred or if no consideration is transferred (<xref href="IFRS03_33.dita#IFRS03_33" id="IFRS03_X1444" base="F16122869" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 33 of the revised IFRS 3</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
