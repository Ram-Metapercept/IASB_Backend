In 2016 the Board published an exposure draft <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Definition of a Business and Accounting for Previously Held           Interests</ph></ph> (2016 Exposure Draft). The 2016 Exposure Draft attracted 80 comment       letters. The Board reviewed those comment letters and consulted the Accounting Standards       Advisory Forum (ASAF), the Capital Markets Advisory Committee and the Global Preparers Forum.       In 2018 the Board issued <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Definition of a Business</ph></ph> (2018 Amendments).

Retrospective application of the amendments to earlier transactions is not required           because it is unlikely to provide useful information to users of financial statements,           could have been costly and could have been impracticable if hindsight were to be needed.           Retrospective application was not prohibited because there may be instances when it would           provide useful information and because when it is used it would not deprive users of           useful information.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
