However, the IASB observed that the definition of a contingent asset in <xref href="../ias37/IAS37_TOC.dita#IAS37_TOC0001" base="F16122709" id="IFRS03_X1403" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 37</xref> includes only ‘possible assets’. A contingent asset arises when it is uncertain whether an entity has an asset at the end of the reporting period, but it is expected that some future event will confirm whether the entity has an asset. Accordingly, the IASB concluded that contingent assets should not be recognised, even if it is virtually certain that they will become unconditional or non‑contingent. If an entity determines that an asset exists at the acquisition date (ie that it has an unconditional right at the acquisition date), that asset is not a contingent asset and should be accounted for in accordance with the appropriate IFRS.</p></body></paragraph>
