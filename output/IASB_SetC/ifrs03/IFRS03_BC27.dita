The boards acknowledged that some multi‑party combinations (in particular, those that are commonly referred to as roll‑up or put‑together transactions) might not be acquisitions; however, they noted that the acquisition method has generally been used to account for them. The boards decided not to change that practice at this time. Consequently, the revised standards require the acquisition method to be used to account for all business combinations, including those that some might not consider acquisitions.</p></body></paragraph>
