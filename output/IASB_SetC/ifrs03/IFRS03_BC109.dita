In other words, its financial position should reflect the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date—not before or after they are obtained or assumed. Moreover, the acquirer’s financial statements for the period should include only the cash inflows and outflows, revenues and expenses and other effects of the acquiree’s operations after the acquisition date.</p></body></paragraph>
