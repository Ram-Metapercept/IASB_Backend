They also observed that goodwill cannot be measured as other than as a residual; measuring the fair value of goodwill directly would not be possible. In contrast, an acquirer can measure the fair value of a non‑controlling interest, for example, on the basis of market prices for the shares held by non‑controlling shareholders or by applying another valuation technique. The non‑controlling interest in the acquiree is a component of a business combination in which less than 100 per cent of the equity interests are acquired, and the boards concluded that, in concept, the non‑controlling interest, like other components of the combination, should be measured at fair value. The boards concluded that the decision‑usefulness of information about a non‑controlling interest would be improved if the revised standards specified a measurement attribute for a non‑controlling interest rather than merely mechanics for determining that amount. They also concluded that, in principle, the measurement attribute should be fair value. The boards also understand from consultation with some constituents who use financial statements for making (or making recommendations about) investment decisions that information about the acquisition‑date fair value of a non‑controlling interest would be helpful in estimating the value of shares of the parent company, not only at the acquisition date but also at future dates.</p></body></paragraph>
