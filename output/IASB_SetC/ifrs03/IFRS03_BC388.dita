Those respondents said that the accounting for previously held equity interests is similar to the accounting for available‑for‑sale securities. Changes in the value of available‑for‑sale securities are recognised in other comprehensive income. They view each step in a step acquisition as a transaction in which the acquirer only obtains more shares in the acquiree. Because the shares that the acquirer previously held have not been exchanged or sold, they think that the recognition of profit or loss is not appropriate.</p></body></paragraph>
