It decided, however, to amend IFRS 9 (and IAS 39)  as a consequential amendment derived from the amendment to IFRS 3 and to retain the link to IFRS 9 (or IAS 39) so that the general guidance in IFRS 9 (or IAS 39) applies to contingent consideration that is within the scope of IFRS 9 (or IAS 39). The IASB also considered whether some liability contingent consideration should be measured at fair value with some fair value changes being presented in other comprehensive income.  It decided that it was preferable that the guidance was consistent for all liability contingent consideration and, consequently, it decided that all liability contingent consideration should be subsequently measured at fair value with any resulting gain or loss, including gain or loss attributable to changes in own credit risk, being recognised in profit or loss. </p></variant></body></paragraph>
