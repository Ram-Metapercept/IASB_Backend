As discussed in <xref href="IFRS03_BC37.dita#IFRS03_BC37" id="IFRS03_X1360" base="F16122552" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC37</xref>, an important purpose of financial statements is to provide users with relevant and reliable information about the performance of the entity and the resources under its control. That applies regardless of the extent of the ownership interest a parent holds in a particular subsidiary. The boards concluded that measurement at fair value enables users to make a better assessment of the cash‑generating abilities of the identifiable net assets acquired in the business combination and the accountability of management for the resources entrusted to it. Thus, the fair value measurement principle in the revised standards will improve the completeness, reliability and relevance of the information reported in an acquirer’s financial statements. The boards also concluded that application of that measurement principle should not impose undue incremental costs on entities because it was also necessary to measure the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed under the provisions of IFRS 3 and SFAS 141, even though those fair values were not always the amounts at which assets and liabilities were recognised.</p></body></paragraph>
