They noted that doing so would avoid the need to distinguish between those groups that are businesses and those that are not. However, both boards noted that broadening the scope of the revised standards beyond acquisitions of businesses would require further research and deliberation of additional issues and delay the implementation of the revised standards’ improvements to practice. The boards therefore did not extend the scope of the revised standards to acquisitions of all asset groups. <xref href="IFRS03_2.dita#IFRS03_2" id="IFRS03_X1247" base="F16122147" class="- topic/xref ">Paragraph 2(b)</xref> of the revised IFRS 3 describes the typical accounting for an asset acquisition.</p></body></paragraph>
