The boards acknowledged particular differences between the two types of entities, for example, the co‑operative issues member shares and the mutual insurance company does not. In addition, the objective of the co‑operative may include providing more social and cultural benefits to its community in addition to the economic benefits provided to its members than does another type of mutual entity. However, the boards concluded that co‑operatives generally provide direct and indirect economic benefits such as dividends and lower costs of services, including credit, or other products directly to its members. The boards concluded that differences in the amount of social and cultural benefits an entity seeks to provide do not justify a conclusion that co‑operatives are sufficiently different from other mutual entities that they do not fit within the definition of a mutual entity in the revised standards. Thus, co‑operatives are included in the definition of a mutual entity in the revised standards.</p></body></paragraph>
