However, that is not the case if the acquirer either makes a bargain purchase or pays more than the acquiree is worth at the acquisition date if the acquirer underpays or overpays. The revised standards provide for recognising a gain in the event of a bargain purchase, but they do not provide for recognising a loss in the event of an overpayment (<xref href="IFRS03_BC382.dita#IFRS03_BC382" id="IFRS03_X1445" base="F16122870" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC382</xref>). Therefore, the boards concluded that focusing directly on the fair value of the consideration transferred rather than on the fair value of the acquirer’s interest in the acquiree, with a presumption that the two amounts are usually equal, would be a more straightforward way of describing how to measure goodwill. (The same conclusion applies to measuring the gain on a bargain purchase, which is discussed in <xref href="IFRS03_BC371.dita#IFRS03_BC371" id="IFRS03_X1446" base="F16122871" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC371–BC381</xref>.) That change in focus will also avoid unproductive disputes in practice about whether the consideration transferred or another valuation technique provides the best evidence for measuring the acquirer’s interest in the acquiree in a particular situation.</p></body></paragraph>
