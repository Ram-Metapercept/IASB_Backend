The 2005 Exposure Draft defined a bargain purchase as a transaction in which the fair value of the acquirer’s interest in the acquiree exceeds the consideration transferred for it, but it would have required that any resulting goodwill should be written off before a gain was recognised. The result of the revised standards’ requirement is the same, but there will be no goodwill to write off if the gain is measured with reference to the identifiable net assets acquired rather than the fair value of the acquirer’s interest in the acquiree.
