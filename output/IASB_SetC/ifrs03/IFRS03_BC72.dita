The boards observed that in a combination of two investor‑owned entities in which the acquirer issues its equity shares as consideration for all of the acquiree’s equity shares, the fair value of the acquiree’s equity is recognised as an addition to the acquirer’s equity—generally as an increase to the acquirer’s ordinary shares and capital. Thus, the equity (net assets) of the combined entity is increased from the acquisition of the acquiree (and the fair value of its net assets), but retained earnings of the acquirer are unaffected. The boards concluded that business combinations of two investor‑owned entities are economically similar to those of two mutual entities in which the acquirer issues member interests for all the member interests of the acquiree. Thus, the boards concluded that those similar transactions should be similarly reported. Therefore, the revised standards clarify that if the only consideration exchanged is the member interests of the acquiree for the member interests of the acquirer (or the member interests of the newly combined entity), the amount of the acquiree’s net assets is recognised as a direct addition to capital or equity, not retained earnings (<xref href="IFRS03_B47.dita#IFRS03_B47" id="IFRS03_X1275" base="F16122225" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph B47</xref> of the revised IFRS 3).</p></body></paragraph>
