That practice was established in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 2.A.5 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Adjustments to Allowances for Loan Losses in Connection with Business Combinations</ph></ph> which states that generally the acquirer’s estimation of the uncollectible portion of the acquiree’s loans should not change from the acquiree’s estimation before the acquisition. However, the FASB also observed that fair value measurement is consistent with guidance in AICPA Statement of Position 03‑3 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer</ph></ph> (AICPA SOP 03‑3), which prohibits ‘carrying over’ or creating valuation allowances in the initial accounting of all loans acquired in transfers that are within its scope, including business combinations accounted for as an acquisition.</p></body></paragraph>
