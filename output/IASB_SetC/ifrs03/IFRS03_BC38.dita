It is also less complete because it does not reflect assets acquired or liabilities assumed that were not included in the pre‑combination financial statements of the combining entities. The pooling method also provides a less faithful representation of the combined entity’s performance in periods after the combination. For example, by recording assets and liabilities at the carrying amounts of predecessor entities, post‑combination revenues may be overstated (and expenses understated) as the result of embedded gains that were generated by predecessor entities but not recognised by them.</p></body></paragraph>
