The boards considered whether an exception to the fair value measurement principle is necessary for assets such as trade receivables and other short‑term and long‑term receivables acquired in a business combination. Several of the boards’ constituents suggested that an exception should be permitted for practical and other reasons, including concerns about comparing credit losses on loans acquired in a business combination with those on originated loans. In developing the 2005 Exposure Draft, however, the boards saw no compelling reason for such an exception. The boards observed that using an acquiree’s carrying basis and including collection costs is inconsistent with the revised standards’ fair value measurement requirement and the underlying notion that the acquirer’s initial measurement, recognition and classification of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed begins on the acquisition date. Because uncertainty about collections and future cash flows is included in the fair value measure of a receivable, the 2005 Exposure Draft proposed that the acquirer should not recognise a separate valuation allowance for acquired assets measured at fair value.</p></body></paragraph>
