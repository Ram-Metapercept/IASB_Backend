First, the amounts recognised in a business combination for non‑controlling interests and goodwill are likely to be lower (and these should be the only two items affected on initial recognition). Second, if a cash‑generating unit is subsequently impaired, any resulting impairment of goodwill recognised through income is likely to be lower than it would have been if the non‑controlling interest had been measured at fair value (although it does not affect the impairment loss attributable to the controlling interest).</p></body></paragraph>
