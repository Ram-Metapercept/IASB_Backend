The primary reason for those changes is the boards’ decision to focus on measuring the components of the business combination, including any non‑controlling interest in the acquiree, rather than measuring the fair value of the acquiree as a whole. The boards observed that neither the requirements of the 2005 Exposure Draft nor those of the revised standards for applying the acquisition method result in a fair value measure of either the acquiree as a whole or the acquirer’s interest in the acquiree. For example, the revised standards do not provide for recognising a loss if the acquirer overpays for the acquiree, ie if the acquisition‑date fair value of the consideration transferred exceeds the acquisition‑date fair value of the acquirer’s interest in the acquiree. The IASB’s decision to allow an acquirer to choose to measure any non‑controlling interest in the acquiree at fair value or on the basis of its proportionate interest in the acquiree’s identifiable net assets adds another potential difference between the results of applying the requirements of the revised IFRS 3 and measuring the acquisition‑date fair value of the acquiree as a whole.
