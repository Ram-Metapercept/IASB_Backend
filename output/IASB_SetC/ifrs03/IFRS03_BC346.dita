Although the amount of the future payments the acquirer will make is conditional on future events, the obligation to make them if the specified future events occur is unconditional. The same is true for a right to the return of previously transferred consideration if specified conditions are met. Failure to recognise that obligation or right at the acquisition date would not faithfully represent the economic consideration exchanged at that date. Thus, both boards concluded that obligations and rights associated with contingent consideration arrangements should be measured and recognised at their acquisition‑date fair values.</p></body></paragraph>
