To do so would also converge with the requirements of the IASB. However, the FASB was concerned about imposing the additional costs on non‑public entities because it believes that the benefits to users of those entities would not be sufficient to warrant imposing those costs. The FASB also observed that the IASB has not completed its separate deliberations on its small and medium‑sized entities project and thus does not have an established practice of differential disclosure for circumstances in which it is clear that the benefits would be sufficient for some entities but not so clear for all entities. Because of those cost‑benefit concerns, the FASB decided not to extend this disclosure requirement to all entities.</p></body></paragraph>
