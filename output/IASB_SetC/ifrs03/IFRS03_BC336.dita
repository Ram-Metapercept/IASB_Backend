SFAS 141(R), together with SFAS 157, provides broadly applicable measurement guidance that is relevant and useful in measuring the acquirer’s interest in the acquiree. However, both boards were concerned that without some discussion of special considerations for measuring the fair value of mutual entities, some acquirers might neglect to consider relevant assumptions that market participants would make about future member benefits when using a valuation technique. For example, the acquirer of a co‑operative entity should consider the value of the member discounts in its determination of the fair value of its interest in the acquiree. Therefore, the boards decided to include a discussion of special considerations in measuring the fair value of mutual entities (<xref href="IFRS03_gB47-B49.dita#IFRS03_gB47_B49" id="IFRS03_X1447" base="F16122873" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs B47–B49 of the revised IFRS 3</xref>).<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS03_FN0063" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/></p></body></paragraph>
