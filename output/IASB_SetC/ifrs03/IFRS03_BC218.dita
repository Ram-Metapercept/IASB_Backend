If the non‑controlling interests are acquired, presumably at fair value, the equity of the group is reduced by the non‑controlling interests’ share of any unrecognised changes in the fair value of the net assets of the business, including goodwill. If the non‑controlling interest is measured initially as a proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets, rather than at fair value, that reduction in the reported equity attributable to the acquirer is likely to be larger. This matter was considered further in the IASB’s deliberations on the proposed amendments to IAS 27.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS03_FN0049" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/></p></body></paragraph>
