The perceived conflict related to the transition guidance for contingent consideration arising from business combinations that had been accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 (as issued in 2004). Before their deletion in January 2008, paragraph 3(c) of IFRS 7, paragraph 4(c) of IAS 32 and paragraph 2(f) of IAS 39<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS03_FN0071" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/> excluded contingent consideration arrangements from the scope of those IFRSs. To allow the acquirer to account for contingent consideration as required by IFRS 3 (revised 2008), the Board deleted those scope exceptions in the second phase of its project on business combinations.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
