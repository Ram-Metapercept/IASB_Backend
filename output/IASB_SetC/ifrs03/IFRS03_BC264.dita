For example, contingent liabilities are identified as an exception to the recognition principle because the revised IFRS 3 includes a recognition condition for them in addition to the recognition conditions in <xref href="IFRS03_11.dita#IFRS03_11" id="IFRS03_X1393" base="F16122668" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs 11 and 12</xref>. Although applying that additional condition will result in not recognising some contingent liabilities, those that meet the additional condition will be recognised in accordance with the recognition principle. Another example is employee benefits, which are identified as a type of asset or liability for which exceptions to both the recognition and the measurement principles are provided. As discussed further in <xref href="IFRS03_BC296.dita#IFRS03_BC296" id="IFRS03_X1394" base="F16122670" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC296–BC300</xref>, the acquirer is required to recognise and measure liabilities and any related assets resulting from the acquiree’s employee benefit arrangements in accordance with <xref href="../ias19/IAS19_TOC0001.dita#IAS19_TOC0001" id="IFRS03_X1395" base="F77794085" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 19 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Employee Benefits</ph></ph></xref> rather than by applying the recognition and measurement principles in the revised IFRS 3. Applying the requirements of IAS 19 will result in recognising many, if not most, types of employee benefit liabilities in the same way as would result from applying the recognition principle (see <xref href="IFRS03_BC297.dita#IFRS03_BC297" id="IFRS03_X1396" base="F16122672" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC297</xref>). However, others, for example withdrawal liabilities from multi‑employer plans for entities applying US GAAP, are not necessarily consistent with the recognition principle. In addition, applying the requirements of IAS 19 generally will result in measuring liabilities for employee benefits (and any related assets) on a basis other than their acquisition‑date fair values. However, applying the requirements of SFAS 146 to one‑off termination benefits results in measuring liabilities for those benefits at their acquisition‑date fair values.</p></body></paragraph>
