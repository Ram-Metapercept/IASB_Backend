Neither of those provisions was identical to the measurement period guidance in the revised standards, although IFRS 3’s was quite similar. However, the measurement period provisions in the revised standards differ in important ways from the allocation period guidance of SFAS 141 and its cost‑allocation method. The revised standards emphasise the principle that assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non‑controlling interest in the acquiree should be measured at their acquisition‑date fair values. SFAS 141’s allocation period and its post‑combination adjustments delayed the recognition of assets and liabilities, and those assets and liabilities were not measured at their acquisition‑date fair values when they were recognised. Therefore, the FASB decided to replace the SFAS 141 term <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">allocation period</i> and its guidance with the measurement period guidance in the revised standards.</p></body></paragraph>
