Neither the cash‑generating abilities of the combined entity nor its future cash flows generally are affected by the method used to account for the combination. However, fair values reflect the expected cash flows associated with acquired assets and assumed liabilities. Because the pooling method records the net assets acquired at their carrying amounts rather than at their fair values, the information that the pooling method provides about the cash‑generating abilities of those net assets is less useful than that provided by the acquisition method.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
