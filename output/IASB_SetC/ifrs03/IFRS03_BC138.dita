Those who did so generally agreed with its proposal to carry forward the requirement of IFRS 3 for recognising liabilities associated with restructuring or exit activities of an acquiree. But the provisions of the 2005 Exposure Draft on that issue represented a change to GAAP in the United States, and the FASB received several responses objecting to the proposed change. It also received some responses that agreed with them, generally for the same reasons that the boards proposed the provisions in the 2005 Exposure Draft.</p></body></paragraph>
