To help preparers and their auditors deal with element uncertainty, the FASB decided to add a requirement for the acquirer to assess whether it is <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">more likely than not</b> that the contingency gives rise to an asset or a liability as defined in the FASB’s Concepts Statement 6. For an asset arising from a contingency, applying that criterion focuses on whether it is more likely than not that the acquirer has obtained control of a future economic benefit as a result of a past transaction or other event. For a liability, the more‑likely‑than‑not criterion focuses on whether the acquirer has a present obligation to sacrifice future economic benefits as a result of a past transaction or other event. If that criterion is met at the acquisition date, the acquirer recognises the asset or liability, measured at its acquisition‑date fair value, as part of the accounting for the business combination. If that criterion is not met at the acquisition date, the acquirer accounts for the non‑contractual contingency in accordance with other US GAAP, including SFAS 5, as appropriate. The FASB concluded that adding the more‑likely‑than‑not criterion would permit acquirers to focus their efforts on the more readily identifiable contingencies of acquirees, thereby avoiding spending disproportionate amounts of time searching for contingencies that, even if identified, would have less significant effects.</p></body></paragraph>
