The result of those mechanics would have been that the non‑controlling interest was effectively measured as the ‘final residual’ in a business combination. That is to say, the reported amount of the non‑controlling interest depended on the amount of goodwill attributed to it, and goodwill is measured as a residual. Thus, in a sense, a non‑controlling interest would have been the residual after allocating the residual, or the residual of a residual.</p></body></paragraph>
