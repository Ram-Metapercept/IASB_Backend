The FASB concluded that measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability arising from a contractual contingency with sufficient reliability as of the acquisition date should not be more difficult than measuring the fair value of many other assets and liabilities that the revised standards require to be measured at fair value as of that date. The terms of the contract, together with information developed during the acquisition process, for example, to determine the price to be paid, should provide the needed information. Sufficient information is also likely to be available to measure the acquisition‑date fair value of assets and liabilities arising from non‑contractual contingencies that satisfy the more‑likely‑than‑not criterion (see <xref href="IFRS03_BC270.dita#IFRS03_BC270" id="IFRS03_X1368" base="F16122590" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC270 and BC271</xref>). The FASB acknowledges that non‑contractual assets and liabilities that do not meet that criterion at the acquisition date are most likely to raise difficult measurement issues and concerns about the reliability of those measures. To address those reliability concerns, the FASB decided that an acquirer should not measure and recognise such assets and liabilities. Rather, assets and liabilities arising from non‑contractual contingencies that do not satisfy the more‑likely‑than‑not criterion at the acquisition date are accounted for in accordance with other US GAAP, including SFAS 5.</p></body></paragraph>
