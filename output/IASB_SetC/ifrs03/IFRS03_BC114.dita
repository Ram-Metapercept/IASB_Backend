That practice was related to the previous emphasis on measuring the cost of (or investment in) the acquiree rather than the acquisition‑date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For example, as discussed in <xref href="IFRS03_BC365.dita#IFRS03_BC365" id="IFRS03_X1293" base="F16122298" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC365–BC370</xref>, some expenses for services received in connection with a business combination were capitalised as part of the cost of the acquiree (and recognised as part of goodwill) <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">as if</b> they were an asset at the acquisition date. In addition, some future costs that an acquirer expected to incur often were viewed as a cost of the acquiree and recognised <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">as if</b> they were a liability at the acquisition date—expected restructuring costs were an example. The boards concluded that the representational faithfulness, consistency and understandability of financial reporting would be improved by eliminating such practices.</p></body></paragraph>
