Consequently,       the concentration test is based on the gross assets acquired, not on net assets.       Thus, the existence of debt (for example, a mortgage loan financing a building)       or other liabilities does not alter the conclusion on whether an acquisition is a       business combination. In addition, in response to requests from respondents,       the Board specified, in finalising the 2018 Amendments, that the gross assets       considered in the concentration test exclude cash and cash equivalents       acquired, deferred tax assets, and goodwill resulting from the effects of deferred       tax liabilities. These exclusions were made because cash acquired, and the tax       base of the assets and liabilities acquired, are independent of whether the       acquired set of activities and assets includes a substantive process.</p></body></paragraph>
