The boards observed that in a reverse acquisition, one entity—the one whose equity interests are acquired—obtains economic (although not legal) control over the other and is therefore the acquirer, as indicated in <xref href="IFRS03_BC15.dita#IFRS03_BC15" id="IFRS03_X1237" base="F16122113" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph B15</xref> of the revised IFRS 3. Therefore, the boards concluded that it is unnecessary to state explicitly that reverse acquisitions are included in the definition of a business combination and thus within the scope of the revised standards.</p></body></paragraph>
