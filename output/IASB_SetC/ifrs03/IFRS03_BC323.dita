In considering whether core goodwill represents a resource <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">controlled</b> by the entity, the IASB considered the assertion that core goodwill arises, at least in part, through factors such as a well‑trained workforce, loyal customers and so on, and that these factors cannot be regarded as controlled by the entity because the workforce could leave and the customers could go elsewhere. However, the IASB, like the FASB, concluded that control of core goodwill is provided by means of the acquirer’s power to direct the policies and management of the acquiree. Therefore, both the IASB and the FASB concluded that core goodwill meets the conceptual definition of an asset.</p></body></paragraph>
