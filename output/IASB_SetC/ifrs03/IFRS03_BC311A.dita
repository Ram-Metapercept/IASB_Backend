After the revised <xref href="IFRS03_TOC.dita#IFRS03_TOC0001" base="F16122830" id="IFRS03_X1433" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 3</xref> was issued in 2008, some constituents raised concerns about the lack of explicit guidance with respect to share‑based payment transactions of the acquiree that the acquirer chooses to replace, even though either they are unaffected by the business combination or vesting is accelerated as a consequence of the business combination. In addition, some were concerned that the measurement guidance for share‑based payment transactions applies only to replacement awards but not to acquiree awards that the acquirer chooses not to replace. In response to those concerns, the Board added explicit guidance in <xref href="IFRS03_B56.dita#IFRS03_B56" base="F16122831" id="IFRS03_X1434" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs B56</xref> and <xref href="IFRS03_B62A.dita#IFRS03_B62A" base="F16122832" id="IFRS03_X1435" class="- topic/xref ">B62A</xref> to clarify that those awards should be accounted for in the same way as acquiree awards that the acquirer is obliged to replace.</p></body></paragraph>
