Supporters of that alternative consider that such a right differs from other identifiable intangible assets recognised in a business combination because, from the perspective of the combined entity, a franchising relationship with an outside party no longer exists. As already noted, however, the reacquired right and the related cash flows continue to exist. The boards concluded that recognising that right separately from goodwill provides users of the financial statements of the combined entity with more decision‑useful information than subsuming the right into goodwill. The boards also observed that a reacquired right meets the contractual‑legal and the separability criteria and therefore qualifies as an identifiable intangible asset.</p></body></paragraph>
