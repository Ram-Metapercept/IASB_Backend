IASC rejected this approach because the fact that a fund has chosen to invest in particular kinds of asset does not affect the nature or amount of the obligation. In particular, assets with a higher expected return carry more risk and an entity should not recognise a smaller liability merely because the plan has chosen to invest in riskier assets with a higher expected return. Consequently, the measurement of the obligation should be independent of the measurement of any plan assets actually held by a plan.</p></body></paragraph>
