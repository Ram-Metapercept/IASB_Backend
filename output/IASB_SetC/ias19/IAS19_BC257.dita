However, when finalising the amendments made in 2011, the Board noted the potential for confusion caused by accounting for some benefits provided in exchange for future service as termination benefits. The Board concluded that treating benefits provided in exchange for future service as short‑term or other long‑term employee benefits or post‑employment benefits would result in the same recognition as is required under Topic 420 (ie the cost of those benefits would be recognised over the period of service), and would maintain the existing distinction between benefits provided in exchange for termination of employment and benefits provided in exchange for services.</p></body></paragraph>
