This amendment to <xref href="IAS19_29.dita#IAS19_29" id="IAS19_X0903" base="F16229443" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 29</xref> addressed a concern that can arise when a plan has a benefit formula determining the benefits to be paid if there are sufficient plan assets, but not requiring the employer to pay additional contributions if there are insufficient plan assets to pay those benefits. In effect, the benefit payments are based on the lower of the benefit formula and the plan assets available. The amendments clarify that such a plan is a defined contribution plan.</p></body></paragraph>
