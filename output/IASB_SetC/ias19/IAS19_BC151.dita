IASC concluded that management’s intention to curtail or settle a defined benefit plan was not a sufficient basis to recognise a loss. IAS 19 revised in 1998 required that curtailment and settlement losses, as well as gains, should be recognised when the curtailment or settlement occurs. The guidance on the recognition of curtailments and settlements conformed to the proposals in E59 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets</ph></ph>.</p></body></paragraph>
