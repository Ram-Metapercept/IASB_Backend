In addition, IASC believed that it was misleading to use defined contribution accounting for multi‑employer plans that are defined benefit plans. This is illustrated by the case of French banks that used defined contribution accounting for defined benefit pension plans operated under industry‑wide collective agreements on a pay‑as‑you‑go basis. Demographic trends made these plans unsustainable and a major reform in 1993 replaced them by defined contribution arrangements for future service. At that point, the banks were compelled to quantify their obligations. Those obligations had previously existed, but had not been recognised as liabilities.</p></body></paragraph>
