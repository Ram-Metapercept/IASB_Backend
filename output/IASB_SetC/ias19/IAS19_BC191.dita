However, other International Accounting Standards defined fair value as ‘the amount for which an asset could be exchanged or a liability settled between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s length transaction’.<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS19_FN0048" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/> This might be taken to imply that no deduction is made for the estimated costs that would be necessary to sell the asset (in other words, it is a mid‑market value, with no adjustment for transaction costs). However, some argue that a plan will eventually have to dispose of its assets in order to pay benefits. Consequently, IASC concluded in E54 that plan assets should be measured at market value. Market value was defined, as in IAS 25 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Accounting for Investments</ph></ph>,<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS19_FN0049" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/> as the amount obtainable from the sale of an asset, in an active market.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
