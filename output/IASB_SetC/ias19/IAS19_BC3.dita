Anecdotal evidence and academic research suggested that many users of financial statements did not fully understand the information that entities provided about post‑employment benefits under the requirements of IAS 19 before the amendments made in 2011. Both users and preparers of financial statements criticised those accounting requirements for failing to provide high quality, transparent information about post‑employment benefits. For example, delays in the recognition of gains and losses give rise to misleading amounts in the statement of financial position and the existence of various options for recognising gains and losses and a lack of clarity in the definitions lead to poor comparability.</p></body></paragraph>
