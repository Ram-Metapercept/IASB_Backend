If a transaction closes a plan and eliminates all further legal or constructive obligations, the transaction may have elements of plan amendments, curtailments and changes in actuarial assumptions because the definitions are not mutually exclusive. For example, if an entity negotiates a lump sum to be paid in connection with the closure of a defined benefit plan, one view is that the entire change in the defined benefit obligation is a settlement, because the lump sum eliminates all further legal and constructive obligations. The other view is that the effect of eliminating future pay growth, earlier payment than expected and the conversion of the benefits to a lump sum is a plan amendment and curtailment, with the settlement occurring when the payment is made.</p></body></paragraph>
