In ED/2013/4 the IASB proposed that some contributions         from employees or third parties may be excluded from being attributed to periods of service as         a negative benefit. Instead, those contributions could be recognised as a reduction in the         service cost in the period in which they are payable if, and only if, they are linked solely         to the employee’s service rendered in that period. An example of such a situation would         be contributions based on an employee’s salary at a fixed percentage that does not         depend on the number of years of service by the employee to the employer. On the other hand,         if an employee is required to contribute a higher percentage of salary in later years of         service, then the contributions are not linked solely to the employee’s service that is         rendered in the period in which the contributions are payable.</p></variants></body></paragraph>
