These respondents believe that projecting the funding position would involve a significant amount of additional work and that in most regions it would be very difficult to establish a suitable adjustment to the liabilities to reflect the effect of conditional indexation based on the funding position. In the Board’s view, an entity should estimate the likely conditional indexation of benefits based on the current funding status of the plan, consistently with how financial assumptions are determined in accordance with <xref href="IAS19_80.dita#IAS19_80" id="IAS19_X0981" base="F16229971" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 80</xref>. Paragraph 80 requires financial assumptions to be based on market expectations at the end of the reporting period for the period over which the obligations are to be settled.</p></body></paragraph>
