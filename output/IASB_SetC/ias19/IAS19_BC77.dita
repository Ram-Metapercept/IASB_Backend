The interest cost on the defined benefit obligation arises from the passage of time. Consequently, the 2010 ED proposed that the net interest component of defined benefit cost should include not only the interest cost on the defined benefit obligation, but also the part of the return on plan assets that arises from the passage of time. In addition, the Board concluded that, to be consistent with the principle of separating components of defined benefit cost with different predictive implications, the net interest component should not include the part of the return on plan assets that does not arise from the passage of time.</p></body></paragraph>
