Consequently,         such contributions should be attributed to periods of service as a reduction of service cost         (ie as a negative benefit).  However, the IASB acknowledged the         general concern about the complexity of the required calculations that could result from the         requirement to attribute the net benefit to periods of service. The IASB thus concluded that         the costs of applying the attribution requirements to some simple types of contributory         plans outweighed the benefits and so the IASB decided to add a practical expedient to         paragraph 93.</p></variants></body></paragraph>
