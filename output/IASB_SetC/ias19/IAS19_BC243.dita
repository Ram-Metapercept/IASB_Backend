The Board considered requiring entities to disclose a maturity analysis of the obligation but, because the cost of such a disclosure might be onerous, the Board concluded that an entity should be required to disclose only the weighted average duration of the obligation. However, the amendments include a maturity analysis as an example of additional disclosures that could meet the disclosure objectives. The disclosure of the average duration provides information similar to the maturity analysis and will enhance the usefulness of other disclosures, such as the disclosure of actuarial assumptions dependent on the duration.</p></body></paragraph>
