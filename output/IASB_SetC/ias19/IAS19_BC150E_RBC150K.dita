The references to both the negative         benefit and net benefit might cause confusion as to whether the back-end loading test in         paragraph 70 is required to be performed on the net benefit, or on the gross benefit and the         negative benefit separately. The IASB observed that performing the test on the net benefit         would add complexity and that the outcome of that test would differ from the outcome of         performing the test on the gross benefit and the negative benefit separately. Consequently,         the IASB proposed to specify in paragraph 93 that the contributions from employees or third         parties that are not solely linked to current-year service should be attributed to periods of         service using the same method of attribution as the gross benefit in accordance with paragraph         70.</p></variants></body></paragraph>
