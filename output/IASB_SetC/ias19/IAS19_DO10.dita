In his view, to be consistent with the presentation of a single net defined benefit liability (asset) in the statement of financial position, the presentation of changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) should be a single net amount presented in profit or loss. Therefore, he does not agree with <xref href="IAS19_g134-134.dita#IAS19_g134_134" id="IAS19_X1156" base="F16231229" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 134</xref> not to specify how to present service cost and net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset). He understands the usefulness of disaggregated information, but believes that an appropriate way of providing information on the components of defined benefit cost is to show them in the notes to the financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
