In the Board’s view, including the effect of changes in demographic assumptions in the service cost component would combine amounts with different predictive values and, consequently, the service cost component is more relevant for assessing an entity’s continuous operational costs if it does not include changes in past estimates of service cost. Most respondents agreed with the proposals in the 2010 ED that service cost should exclude changes in demographic assumptions.</p></body></paragraph>
