Therefore, recognising unvested past service cost immediately is consistent with the recognition of unvested current service cost that IAS 19 treats as an obligation in <xref href="IAS19_72.dita#IAS19_72" base="F16230029" id="IAS19_X1008" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 72</xref>.

If an entity recognised unvested past service cost over the vesting period, an entity could change how much of the total expense is recognised by changing the amount subject to vesting conditions and the vesting period. Any approach to attributing unvested benefits to periods of service is arbitrary. However, recognising unvested past service cost immediately is more consistent with <xref href="IAS19_72.dita#IAS19_72" base="F16230032" id="IAS19_X1011" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 72</xref> and the recognition of unvested current service cost.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
