This does not require entities to make a distinction between those items if they occur at the same time. It is also consistent with the requirements in IAS 19 before the amendments made in 2011, and with the recognition in profit or loss of amounts from other related transactions, such as termination benefits and restructuring costs.</p></body></paragraph>
