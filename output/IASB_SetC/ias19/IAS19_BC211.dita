Many supported a principle‑based approach to disclosure that would put more emphasis on meeting the disclosure objectives. Some suggested that it would be better if the Board supported the disclosure objectives through the use of ‘encouraged but not required’ disclosures or by including examples illustrating the application of the disclosure objectives in different circumstances. In response to these concerns the Board included a requirement that an entity should consider the level of disclosure necessary to satisfy the disclosure objectives and how much emphasis to place on each requirement.</p></body></paragraph>
