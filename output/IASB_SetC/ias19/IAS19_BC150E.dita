The Board noted that the amendment only clarifies that the depth of the market for high quality corporate bonds should be assessed at a currency level and not a country/regional market level. It does not require that the basket of high quality corporate bonds used to determine the discount rate for post-employment obligations must include all the high quality corporate bonds issued in a currency.</p></body></paragraph>
