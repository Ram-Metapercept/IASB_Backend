Respondents noted that this would have the effect of limiting the service cost component to current service cost, and would maintain the Board’s conclusion that amounts with different predictive value should be presented separately. Furthermore, such an approach would eliminate the requirement to distinguish between past service cost, the effects of settlements, and actuarial gains and losses for the purpose of presentation.</p></body></paragraph>
