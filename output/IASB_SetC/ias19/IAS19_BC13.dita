The Board did not proceed with that proposal because it is closely related to a fundamental review of the accounting for contribution‑based promises (see <xref href="IAS19_gBC117-BC120.dita#IAS19_gBC117_BC120/IAS19_gBC117_BC120_TI" id="IAS19_X0894" base="F16229439" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC117–BC120</xref>).</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(d)</li_value> <p id="IAS19_P1016" base="F16150639" class="- topic/p "><i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">Exemption for entities participating in multi‑employer defined benefit plans</i>—The Board rejected a proposal to permit all entities participating in a multi‑employer defined benefit plan to account for these plans as defined contribution plans. The Board concluded that extending that exemption would be contrary to its general approach of limiting exceptions. The Board also believes that such an exemption would not be appropriate for all multi‑employer plans, such as when an entity becomes a dominant participant in a multi‑employer plan, perhaps because other participants leave the plan (see <xref href="IAS19_gBC39-BC39.dita#IAS19_gBC39_BC39/IAS19_gBC39_BC39_TI" id="IAS19_X0895" base="F16229440" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC39</xref>).</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(e)</li_value> <p id="IAS19_P1017" base="F16150659" class="- topic/p "><i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">IFRIC‑related matters</i>—The Board did not incorporate into IAS 19 the requirements of <xref href="../ifric14/IFRIC14_TOC0001.dita#IFRIC14_TOC0001" id="IAS19_X0896" base="F16229441" class="- topic/xref ">IFRIC 14 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">IAS 19—The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction</ph></ph></xref>. Incorporating IFRIC 14 would require changes to the drafting, which could have unintended consequences. The Board also considered other questions received by the IFRIC but concluded that it would not amend IAS 19 at this time.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
