They think that the proposed amendment could result in anomalous outcomes in these countries, because a discount rate determined from high quality corporate bonds denominated in a stronger currency could be inconsistent with the inflation rate (and the other assumptions) used in these countries to determine the cost of providing post-employment benefits. The Board noted that this anomaly is not unique to the fact pattern raised. Instead, inflation rates in one location may be different to those in another, even if they are in the same country, state or regional market with a shared currency. In the Board’s view, an analysis of the potential effect of the amendment would not provide useful additional information. The Board concluded that the amendment is an improvement that should not be delayed for a narrow range of situations that the Board had already considered in proposing the amendment.</p></body></paragraph>
