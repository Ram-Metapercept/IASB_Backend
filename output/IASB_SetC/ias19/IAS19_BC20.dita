The Board concluded that an entity should classify a benefit as a short‑term employee benefit if the whole of the benefit is expected to be settled before twelve months after the end of the annual reporting period in which the related service was provided. This will ensure that the benefit is measured on the same basis throughout its life and is consistent with the measurement requirements of <xref href="IAS19_69.dita#IAS19_69" id="IAS19_X0899" base="F16229442" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 69</xref>.</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(c)</li_value> <p id="IAS19_P1029" base="F16150701" class="- topic/p "><i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">Reclassification</i>—if the expected settlement date of a benefit classified initially as a short‑term employee benefit changes subsequently to a date more than twelve months after the end of the reporting period, then the undiscounted amount of that benefit could differ materially from its present value. The Board concluded that the classification of a short‑term employee benefit should be revisited if it no longer meets the definition. This maintains the objective that the benefits should not be measured at an amount that would differ materially from their present value. However, the Board concluded that a temporary change in expectation should not trigger reclassification because such a change would not be indicative of a change in the underlying characteristics of the benefit. The Board noted that reclassification of a benefit from other long‑term employee benefits to short‑term employee benefits is less of a concern because in that case measuring the benefit at its undiscounted amount should not differ materially from measuring the benefit at its present value.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
