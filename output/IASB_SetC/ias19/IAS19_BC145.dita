They suggested that the Board should not address risk‑sharing features until it conducted a fundamental review of classification and measurement in order to address the whole spectrum of plans from defined contribution to defined benefit (including contribution‑based promises). However, the Board observed that the current model is based on the ultimate cost of the benefit, and thus should be able to take into account risk‑sharing features that reduce the ultimate cost of the benefit to the entity.</p></body></paragraph>
