Several respondents suggested that general and administrative and overhead costs <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">directly attributable</i> to the exploration and evaluation activities should qualify for inclusion in the carrying amount of the asset.

However, the Board noted that such a treatment would seem to be inconsistent with <xref href="../ias16/IAS16_19.dita#IAS16_19" id="IFRS06_X0181" base="F15831667" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 19(d) of IAS 16</xref>. The IFRS was not regarded as the appropriate Standard in which to resolve this inconsistency, and the Board decided to delete the reference in the IFRS to administrative and other general overheads. The treatment of such expenditures would be an accounting policy choice; the chosen policy should be consistent with one of the treatments available under IFRSs.</p></body></paragraph>
