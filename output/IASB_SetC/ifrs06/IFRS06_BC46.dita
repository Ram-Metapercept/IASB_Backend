It noted that entities might be able to monitor exploration and evaluation assets for internal management purposes at the level of an oilfield or a contiguous ore body. The Board did not intend to require impairment to be assessed at such a low level. Consequently, the IFRS permits CGUs to be aggregated. However, the Board decided to require the level at which impairment was assessed to be no larger than a segment, based on either the entity’s primary or the entity’s secondary segment reporting format in accordance with IAS 14 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Segment Reporting</ph></ph>. The Board concluded, consistently with the approach to goodwill in <xref href="../ias36/IAS36_TOC0001.dita#IAS36_TOC0001" id="IFRS06_X0212" base="F15831802" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 36</xref>, that this approach was necessary to ensure that entities managed on a matrix basis could test exploration and evaluation assets for impairment at the level of reporting that reflects the way they manage their operations. This requirement is no less rigorous than ED 6’s requirement that the special CGU should ‘be no larger than a segment’.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS06_FN0007" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/></p></body></paragraph>
