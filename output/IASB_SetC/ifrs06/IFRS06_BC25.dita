In addition, the Board noted that IFRSs require that expenditures should be treated consistently for comparable activities and between reporting periods. Any change in what is deemed to be an expenditure qualifying for recognition as an exploration and evaluation asset should be treated as a change in an accounting policy accounted for in accordance with <xref href="../ias08/IAS08_TOC.dita#IAS08_TOC0001" base="F15832145" id="IFRS06_X0177" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 8</xref>. Pending the comprehensive review of accounting for extractive activities, the Board does not think that it is feasible to define what expenditures should be included or excluded.</p></body></paragraph>
