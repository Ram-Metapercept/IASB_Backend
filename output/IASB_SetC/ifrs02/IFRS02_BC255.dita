The Board therefore concluded that the disclosure should not be retained as a mandatory requirement, but instead should be given as an example of an additional disclosure that entities should consider providing. For example, entities with a significant amount of cash‑settled arrangements that experience significant share price volatility will probably find that the disclosure is helpful to users of their financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
