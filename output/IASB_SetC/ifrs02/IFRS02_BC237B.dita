Furthermore, the Board noted that no non‑arbitrary or unambiguous criteria exist to distinguish between a decision by the counterparty not to meet a non‑vesting condition and a cancellation by the entity. The Board considered establishing a rebuttable presumption that a counterparty’s failure to meet a non‑vesting condition is (or is not) a cancellation, unless it can be demonstrated that the entity had no (or had some) influence over the counterparty’s decision. The Board did not believe that the information about the entity’s decision‑making processes that is publicly available would be sufficient to determine whether the presumption has been rebutted. Therefore, the Board concluded that a failure to meet a non‑vesting condition should be treated as a cancellation when either the entity or the counterparty can choose whether that non‑vesting condition is met.</p></body></paragraph>
