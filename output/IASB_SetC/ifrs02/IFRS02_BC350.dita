Potential diversity in practice had emerged because some were of the view that if share based payment awards are granted to employees conditional on the entity-wide profit, it is not clear that the profit target constitutes a performance condition on the basis that the employee might have so little influence on the entity-wide profit that it is not clear whether the target is able to sufficiently incentivise an individual employee’s actions. Others held the view that because the entity is in business in order to make a profit, it is reasonable to assume that all employees contribute directly or indirectly to the entity-wide profit, ie that the whole body of employees contribute towards the entity-wide profit.</p></body></paragraph>
