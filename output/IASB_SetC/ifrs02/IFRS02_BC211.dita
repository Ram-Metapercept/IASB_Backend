Rather, the respondents focused on accounting for the ‘cost’ of the equity instruments issued (ie the credit side of the transaction rather than the debit side), and took the view that if the share options or shares are forfeited, no cost was incurred, and thus any amounts recognised previously should be reversed, as would happen with a cash‑settled transaction.</p></body></paragraph>
