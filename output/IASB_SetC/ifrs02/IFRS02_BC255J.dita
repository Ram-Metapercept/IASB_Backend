This is because dividing the transaction into two components requires an entity to estimate changes that affect the amount that the entity is required to withhold and remit to the tax authority on the employee’s behalf in respect of the share-based payment. As that estimate changes, the entity would need to reclassify a portion of the share-based payment between cash-settled and equity-settled.</p></body></paragraph>
