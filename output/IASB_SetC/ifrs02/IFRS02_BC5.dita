For example, the proposal in the IASC/G4+1 Discussion Paper and ED 2 <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">Share‑based Payment</i>, that share‑based payment transactions should be recognised in the financial statements, resulting in an expense when the goods or services are consumed, received strong support from investors and other users of financial statements. Recent economic events have emphasised the importance of high quality financial statements that provide neutral, transparent and comparable information to help users make economic decisions. In particular, the omission of expenses arising from share‑based payment transactions with employees has been highlighted by investors, other users of financial statements and other commentators as causing economic distortions and corporate governance concerns.</p></body></paragraph>
