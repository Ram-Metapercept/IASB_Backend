The Board noted that the term ‘best available estimate’ is already used in IFRS 2 and is not a new notion. This term is also used in paragraph 20 of IFRS 2 for estimating the number of equity instruments expected to vest of an equity-settled share-based payment. The Board further observed that analysing such a notion would potentially involve examining similar notions in other Standards and observed that such notions would be better examined as part of a broader project.</p></body></paragraph>
