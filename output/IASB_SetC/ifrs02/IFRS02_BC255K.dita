In response to these concerns the Board decided to explain how the requirements of paragraph 29 of IFRS 2 would be applied. Paragraph 33G explains that the accounting for the amount transferred to the tax authority in respect of the employee’s tax obligation associated with the share-based payment is consistent with the accounting described in paragraph 29 of this Standard (ie as if the entity had repurchased the vested equity instruments). This amendment does not address the recognition and measurement of any liability to the tax authority.</p></body></paragraph>
