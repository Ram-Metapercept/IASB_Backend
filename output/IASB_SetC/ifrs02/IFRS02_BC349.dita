The Board confirmed that it was not its intention to do so. It observed that the link between the employee’s service/performance against a given performance target is management’s responsibility. It noted that each employee has, in varying degrees, an influence over an entity’s (or group’s) overall performance, that is, over an entity’s (or group’s) own operations (or activities) or the price (or value) of its equity instruments. Consequently, the Board decided to omit the requirement that the target “needs to be within the influence of the employee” to avoid further confusion.</p></body></paragraph>
