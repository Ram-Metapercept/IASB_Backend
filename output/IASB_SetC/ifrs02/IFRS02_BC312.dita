Temporary differences usually arise from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and the amount attributed to those assets and liabilities for tax purposes.

It gives an example of research costs that are recognised as an expense in the financial statements in the period in which the costs are incurred, but are deductible for tax purposes in a later accounting period. The Standard states that the difference between the tax base of the research costs, being the amount that will be deductible in a future accounting period, and the carrying amount of nil is a deductible temporary difference that results in a deferred tax asset (<xref href="../ias12/IAS12_9.dita#IAS12_9" id="IFRS02_X1008" base="F15999011" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 12, paragraph 9</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
