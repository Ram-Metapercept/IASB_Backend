For example, it is argued that share appreciation rights (SARs) settled in cash are substantially similar to SARs settled in shares, because in both cases the employee receives consideration to the same value. Also, if the SARs are settled in shares and the shares are immediately sold, the employee ends up in exactly the same position as under a cash‑settled SAR, ie with cash equal to the appreciation in the entity’s share price over the specified period. Similarly, some argue that share options and cash‑settled SARs are economically similar. This is particularly true when the employee realises the gain on the exercise of share options by selling the shares immediately after exercise, as commonly occurs. Either way, the employee ends up with an amount of cash that is based on the appreciation of the share price over a period of time. If cash‑settled transactions and equity‑settled transactions are economically similar, the accounting treatment should be the same.</p></body></paragraph>
