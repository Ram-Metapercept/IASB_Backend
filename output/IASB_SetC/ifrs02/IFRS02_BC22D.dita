Consequently, IFRS 2 applies even when the entity receiving the goods or services has no obligation to settle the transaction and regardless of whether the payments to the suppliers are equity‑settled or cash‑settled. To avoid the need for further guidance on the scope of IFRS 2 for group transactions, the Board decided to amend some of the defined terms and to supersede paragraph 3 by a new <xref href="IFRS02_3A.dita#IFRS02_3A" id="IFRS02_X0890" base="F15998437" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 3A</xref> to state clearly the principles applicable to those transactions.</p></body></paragraph>
