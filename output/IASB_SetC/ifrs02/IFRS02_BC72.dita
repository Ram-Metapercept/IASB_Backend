If the cash flows related to anything other than the entity’s own shares, this approach would be appropriate. For example, suppose ABC Ltd bought shares in another entity, XYZ Ltd, for a total cost of CU500,000,<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS02_FN0044" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/> and later sold the shares to employees for a total of CU400,000. The entity would recognise an expense for the CU100,000 shortfall.</p></body></paragraph>
