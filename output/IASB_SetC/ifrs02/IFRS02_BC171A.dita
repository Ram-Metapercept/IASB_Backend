In particular, the Board noted that it is important to distinguish between non‑vesting conditions, which need to be satisfied for the counterparty to become entitled to the equity instrument, and vesting conditions such as performance conditions. In February 2006 the Board published an exposure draft <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Vesting Conditions and Cancellations</ph></ph>, which proposed to restrict vesting conditions to service conditions and performance conditions. Those are the only conditions that determine whether <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">the entity receives the services</i> that entitle the counterparty to the share‑based payment, and therefore whether the share‑based payment vests. In particular, a share‑based payment may vest even if some non‑vesting conditions have not been met. The feature that distinguishes a performance condition from a non‑vesting condition is that the former has an explicit or implicit service requirement and the latter does not.</p></body></paragraph>
