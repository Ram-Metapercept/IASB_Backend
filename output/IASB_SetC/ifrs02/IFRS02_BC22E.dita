For example, the terms ‘shareholder’ and ‘parent’ have different meanings: a shareholder is not necessarily a parent, and a parent does not have to be a shareholder. The Board noted that share‑based payment transactions among group entities are often directed by the parent, indicating a level of control. Therefore, the Board clarified the boundaries of a ‘group’ by adopting the same definition as in <xref href="../ias27/IAS27_4.dita#IAS27_4" id="IFRS02_X0891" base="F78010887" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 4 of IAS 27 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements</ph></ph></xref>, which includes only a parent and its subsidiaries.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS02_FN0034" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/></p></body></paragraph>
