In this situation, the Board concluded that the entity should measure the share option at its intrinsic value, initially at the date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders service and subsequently at each reporting date until the final settlement of the share‑based payment arrangement, with the effects of the remeasurement recognised in profit or loss. For a grant of share options, the share‑based payment arrangement is finally settled when the options are exercised, forfeited (eg upon cessation of employment) or lapse (eg at the end of the option’s life). For a grant of shares, the share‑based payment arrangement is finally settled when the shares vest or are forfeited.</p></body></paragraph>
