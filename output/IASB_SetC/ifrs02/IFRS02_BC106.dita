Similarly, all contracts or arrangements that will be settled by the entity issuing shares or share options are classified as equity. However, this differs from the distinction between liabilities and equity applied in <xref href="../ias32/IAS32_TOC.dita#IAS32_TOC0001" base="F15998630" id="IFRS02_X0938" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 32</xref>. Although IAS 32 also considers, in its debt/equity distinction, whether an instrument contains an obligation to transfer cash or other assets, this is supplemented by a second criterion, which considers whether the number of shares to be issued (and cash to be received) on settlement is fixed or variable. IAS 32 classifies a contract that will or may be settled in the entity’s own equity instruments as a liability if the contract is a non‑derivative for which the entity is or may be obliged to deliver a variable number of the entity’s own equity instruments; or a derivative that will or may be settled other than by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of the entity’s own equity instruments.</p></body></paragraph>
