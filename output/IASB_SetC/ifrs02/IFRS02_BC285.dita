The Board concluded that, although convergence is an important objective, it would not be appropriate to delay the issue of the IFRS, because of the pressing need for a standard on share‑based payment, as explained in <xref href="IFRS02_BC2.dita#IFRS02_BC2" id="IFRS02_X0999" base="F16382239" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC2–BC5</xref>. In any event, at the time the IASB concluded its deliberations, a substantial amount of convergence had been achieved. For example, the FASB agreed with the IASB that all share‑based payment transactions should be recognised in the financial statements, measured on a fair value measurement basis, including transactions in which share options are granted to employees. Hence, the FASB agreed that the disclosure alternative in SFAS 123 should be eliminated.</p></body></paragraph>
