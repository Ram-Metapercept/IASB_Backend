For example, research by Bear Stearns and Credit Suisse First Boston on the S&amp;P 500 shows that, had the fair value measurement method in SFAS 123 been applied for the purposes of recognising an expense for employee stock‑based compensation, the earnings of the S&amp;P 500 companies would have been significantly lower, and that the effect is growing. The effect on reported earnings is substantial in some sectors, where companies make heavy use of share options.</p></body></paragraph>
