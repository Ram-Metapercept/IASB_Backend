They asserted that because the issuance of stock options does not result in the incurrence of a liability, no expense should be recognised.

However, if receipt of an asset, such as services, and its use occur virtually simultaneously, the asset often is not recorded.) [paragraph 88]</p></lq></body></paragraph>
