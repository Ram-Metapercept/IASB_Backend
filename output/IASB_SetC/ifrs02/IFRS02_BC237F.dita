The Board required this measurement to be made by reference to the modification-date fair value of the equity instruments granted. The Board noted that, at the original grant date, there was a shared understanding that the entity would pay cash for services to be rendered by the counterparty. However, at the modification date, the entity and the counterparty have a new shared understanding that the entity will issue equity instruments to the counterparty. Therefore, the Board concluded that the modification-date fair value should be used to measure the modified equity-settled share-based payment.</p></body></paragraph>
