The Board therefore concluded that, in general, the IFRS on share‑based payment should require a fair value measurement method to be applied to all types of share‑based payment transactions, including all types of employee share‑based payment. Hence, the Board concluded that the IFRS should not allow a choice between a fair value measurement method and an intrinsic value measurement method, and should not permit a choice between recognition and disclosure of expenses arising from employee share‑based payment transactions.</p></body></paragraph>
