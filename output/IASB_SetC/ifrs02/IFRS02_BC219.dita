The lapsing of the share option does not represent a gain to the entity, because there is no change to the entity’s net assets. In other words, although some might see such an event as being a benefit to the remaining shareholders, it has no effect on the entity’s financial position. In effect, one type of equity interest (the share option holders’ interest) becomes part of another type of equity interest (the shareholders’ interest). The Board therefore concluded that the only accounting entry that might be required is a movement within equity, to reflect that the share options are no longer outstanding (ie as a transfer from one type of equity interest to another).</p></body></paragraph>
