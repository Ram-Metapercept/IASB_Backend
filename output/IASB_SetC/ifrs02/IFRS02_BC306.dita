For example, for share options granted to employees, factors that affect the value of the option from the individual employee’s perspective only are not relevant to estimating the price that would be set by a knowledgeable, willing market participant. Many respondents’ comments about measurement reliability, and the differences between employee share options and traded options, often focused on the value of the option from the employee’s perspective. Therefore, the Board concluded that the IFRS should emphasise that the objective is to estimate the fair value of the share option, not an employee‑specific value.</p></body></paragraph>
