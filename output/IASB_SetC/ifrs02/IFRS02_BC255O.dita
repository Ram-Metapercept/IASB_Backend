For example, an entity may not be obliged by tax laws or regulations to withhold an amount for an employee’s tax obligation but it is the entity’s normal practice to withhold such an amount. The Board noted that its intent is to limit the exception to circumstances in which the tax laws or regulations impose the obligation on the entity to withhold an amount for the employee’s tax obligation associated with a share-based payment for the exception in paragraph 33F to apply.</p></body></paragraph>
