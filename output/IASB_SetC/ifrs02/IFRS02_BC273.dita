Typically, this results in no expense being recognised for fixed plans, because most share options granted under fixed plans are granted at the money. For performance‑related and other variable plans, an expense is measured at intrinsic value at the measurement date. The measurement date is when both the number of shares or share options that the employee is entitled to receive and the exercise price are fixed. Because this measurement date is likely to be much later than grant date, any expense is subject to uncertainty and, if the share price is increasing, the expense for performance‑related plans would be larger than for fixed plans.</p></body></paragraph>
