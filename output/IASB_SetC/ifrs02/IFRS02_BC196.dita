However, it states that, ‘in unusual circumstances, the terms of the stock option or other equity instrument may make it virtually impossible to reasonably estimate the instrument’s fair value at the date it is granted’. The standard requires that, in such situations, measurement should be delayed until it is possible to estimate reasonably the instrument’s fair value. It notes that this is likely to be the date at which the number of shares to which the employee is entitled and the exercise price are determinable. This could be vesting date. The standard requires that estimates of compensation expense for earlier periods (ie until it is possible to estimate fair value) should be based on current intrinsic value.</p></body></paragraph>
