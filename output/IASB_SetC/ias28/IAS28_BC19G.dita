The Board observed that <xref href="../ias27/IAS27_10.dita#IAS27_10/IAS27_10_V3" base="F60693588" id="IAS28_X0460" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 10 of IAS 27</xref> should not be read to mean that, in all circumstances, all investments in associates are one ‘category’ of investment and all investments in joint ventures are one ‘category’ of investment. The issue raised by respondents arises only if the requirement in paragraph 10 of IAS 27 were to be interpreted in that way. An entity that elects to measure some associates or joint ventures at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with <xref href="IAS28_18.dita#IAS28_18" base="F60693589" id="IAS28_X0461" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 18 of IAS 28</xref> would retain that measurement basis for those associates and joint ventures in its separate financial statements, as required by <xref href="../ias27/IAS27_11.dita#IAS27_11" base="F60693590" id="IAS28_X0462" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 11 of IAS 27</xref>. The entity could then choose to measure its remaining associates and joint ventures either at cost, in accordance with <xref href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_TOC.dita#IFRS09_TOC0001" base="F70459370" id="IAS28_X0463" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 9</xref> or using the equity method in accordance with paragraph 10 of IAS 27.</p></body></paragraph>
