The amendments did not introduce any new accounting requirements for investments in associates or joint ventures. This is because paragraphs 18–19 of IAS 28 already allowed an investment entity to measure its investments in associates and joint ventures at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9. A wider range of entities, including venture capital organisations, or mutual funds, unit trusts and similar entities including investment-linked insurance funds, may also elect to measure their investments in associates and joint ventures in the same way.</p></body></paragraph>
