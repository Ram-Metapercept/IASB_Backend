This is because retrospective application may not have been possible without the use of hindsight. When the Board developed IFRS 9, it provided transition requirements for scenarios in which it would have been impracticable for an entity to apply particular requirements retrospectively. Consequently, the Board provided similar transition requirements in the amendments to IAS 28 for long-term interests because the effect of the amendments might be that an entity applies IFRS 9 for the first time to those interests. Accordingly, for example, such an entity would assess its business model for such long-term interests based on the facts and circumstances that exist on the date it first applies the amendments (for example, 1 January 2019 for an entity applying the amendments from that date).</p></body></paragraph>
