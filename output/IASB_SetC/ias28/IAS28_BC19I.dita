In addition, if the costs of applying the amendments retrospectively are considered excessive, an entity can choose not to change any of its previous decisions regarding measurement. This is because retrospective application of a choice of measurement for each associate or joint venture, in effect, means that an entity is not required to reassess its previous decisions. The Board also noted that retrospective application in accordance with <xref href="../ias08/IAS08_TOC.dita#IAS08_TOC0001" base="F60693592" id="IAS28_X0464" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 8 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors</ph></ph></xref> means that an entity will not use hindsight when first applying the amendments—<xref href="../ias08/IAS08_53.dita#IAS08_53/IAS08_53_V2" base="F60693593" id="IAS28_X0465" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 53 of IAS 8</xref> states that hindsight should not be used when applying a new accounting policy to a prior period, either in making assumptions about what management’s intentions would have been in a prior period or in estimating the amounts recognised, measured and disclosed in a prior period.</p></body></paragraph>
