Some respondents to that exposure draft believed that it could be impracticable for the entity to prepare financial statements as of the same date when the date of the entity’s financial statements and those of the associate or joint venture differ by more than three months. The Board noted that a three-month limit operates in several jurisdictions and it was concerned that a longer period, such as six months, would lead to the recognition of stale information. Therefore, it decided to retain the three-month limit. </p></body></paragraph>
