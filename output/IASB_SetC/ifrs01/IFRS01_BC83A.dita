After the revised IAS 39 was issued, constituents raised concerns that retrospective application would diverge from the requirements of US GAAP, would be difficult and expensive to implement, and might require subjective assumptions about what was observable and what was not. In response to these concerns, the Board decided to permit entities to apply the requirements in the last sentence of IAS 39 paragraph AG76 and in paragraph AG76A, in any one of the following ways: </p> <ol outputclass="static" id="IFRS01_L0160" base="F77653148" type="lower-alpha" class="- topic/ol "><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS01_P2890" base="F77653150" class="- topic/p ">retrospectively;</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS01_P2891" base="F77653152" class="- topic/p ">prospectively to transactions entered into after 25 October 2002; or</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS01_P2892" base="F77653154" class="- topic/p ">prospectively to transactions entered into after 1 January 2004.</p></li></ol> <p id="IFRS01_P2893" base="F77653155" class="- topic/p ">In 2010 the Board was asked to reconsider whether the fixed dates of 25 October 2002 and 1 January 2004 continued to be appropriate for first‑time adopters. Constituents were concerned that, as time passes, these fixed dates become more remote and increasingly less relevant to the financial reports as additional jurisdictions adopt IFRSs. The Board accepted that the cost of reconstructing transactions back in time to 25 October 2002 or 1 January 2004 was likely to outweigh the benefit to be achieved in doing so. It therefore amended the fixed dates included in paragraph <xref href="IFRS01_gD20-D20.dita#IFRS01_gD20_D20" id="IFRS01_X1819" base="F77653156" class="- topic/xref ">D20 of IFRS 1</xref> to permit a first‑time adopter to apply the ‘day 1’ gain or loss recognition requirement in IAS 39 paragraphs AG76 and AG76A prospectively from ‘the date of transition to IFRSs’.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS01_FN0042" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/></p></variant></body></paragraph>
