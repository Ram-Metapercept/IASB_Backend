Despite this requirement, an entity that had already applied IFRSs before the effective date of IAS 39 (as revised in March 2004) may (a) designate a previously recognised financial asset as available for sale on initial application of IAS 39 (as revised in March 2004), or (b) designate a previously recognised financial instrument as at fair value through profit or loss in the circumstances specified in paragraph 105B of IAS 39. The Board decided that the same considerations apply to first‑time adopters as to entities that already apply IFRSs. Accordingly, a first‑time adopter of IFRSs may similarly designate a previously recognised financial instrument in accordance with <xref href="IFRS01_gD19-D19C.dita" id="IFRS01_X1742" scope="local" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph D19</xref> of the IFRS. Such an entity shall disclose the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities designated into each category at the date of designation and their classification and carrying amount in the previous financial statements.</p>     </variant></body></paragraph>
