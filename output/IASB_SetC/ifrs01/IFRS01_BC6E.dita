The Board thinks that this disclosure requirement provides users with useful information and would discourage the intentional omission of the statement of compliance with IFRSs solely to allow an entity to take advantage of the exemptions in IFRS 1. The Board also decided that an entity that does not elect to apply IFRS 1 shall explain the reasons why it has elected to apply IFRSs as if it had never stopped applying them. The Board believes that this disclosure ensures that useful information will be provided to users.</p></body></paragraph>
