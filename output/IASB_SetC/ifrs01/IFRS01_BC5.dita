In the Board’s view, this would lead to complexity and uncertainty. Also, an entity should not be regarded as having adopted IFRSs if it does not give all disclosures required by IFRSs, because that approach would diminish the importance of disclosures and undermine efforts to promote full compliance with IFRSs. Therefore, the IFRS contains a simple test that gives an unambiguous answer: an entity has adopted IFRSs if, and only if, its financial statements contain an explicit and unreserved statement of compliance with IFRSs (<xref href="IFRS01_3.dita#IFRS01_3" id="IFRS01_X1600" base="F15824369" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 3</xref> of the IFRS).</p></body></paragraph>
