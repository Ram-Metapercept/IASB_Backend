The Board decided to retain the transition requirements as set out in <xref href="IFRS01_TOC.dita#IFRS01_TOC0001" base="F16164138" id="IFRS01_X1641" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 1</xref>, for the reasons given in <xref href="IFRS01_BC20.dita#IFRS01_BC20" base="F15824622" id="IFRS01_X1642" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC20</xref>. However, the Board amended the date from which prospective application was required to transactions that occur on or after 1 January 2004 in order to overcome the practical difficulties of restating transactions that had been derecognised before that date. In 2010 the Board was asked to reconsider whether 1 January 2004 is the appropriate date from which a first‑time adopter should be required to restate past derecognition transactions. Constituents were concerned that, as time passes, the fixed transition date of 1 January 2004 becomes more remote and increasingly less relevant to the financial reports as additional jurisdictions adopt IFRSs. The Board accepted that the cost of reconstructing transactions back in time to 1 January 2004 was likely to outweigh the benefit to be achieved in doing so.                     It therefore amended the fixed date of 1 January 2004 in <xref href="IFRS01_gB2-B3.dita" scope="local" id="IFRS01_X1644" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph B2</xref> to ‘the date of transition to IFRSs’. The Board also amended the wording of the illustration in paragraph B2, in order to clarify that it is providing an example.</p></body></paragraph>
