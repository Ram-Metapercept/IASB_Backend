Some argued that an entity should present this information in accordance with IFRSs, to ensure comparability over time. However, the Board concluded that such a requirement would cause costs out of proportion to the benefit to users. The IFRS requires disclosure of the nature of the main adjustments needed to make historical summaries included in financial statements or interim financial reports comply with IFRSs (<xref href="IFRS01_g22-22.dita#IFRS01_g22_22" id="IFRS01_X1838" base="F15825417" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 22</xref> of the IFRS).
