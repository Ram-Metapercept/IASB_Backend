First‑time adopters of IFRSs face problems similar to those facing entities that already apply IFRSs. Moreover, although first‑time adopters have the option of using fair value as the deemed cost of an asset at the date of transition to IFRSs, this option is not applicable to all qualifying assets, such as inventories. Furthermore, the Board concluded that the existence of the deemed cost option is not sufficient to justify a more stringent requirement for the application of IAS 23 for first‑time adopters than for entities that already apply IFRSs. A more stringent requirement for the adoption of the capitalisation treatment could be justified when IFRS 1 was originally issued because capitalisation was then an option. The requirements for the application of mandatory capitalisation, on the other hand, should be the same for entities that already apply IFRSs and for first‑time adopters. Therefore, the Board decided to amend IFRS 1, allowing first‑time adopters transitional provisions equivalent to those available to entities that already apply IFRSs in <xref href="../ias23/IAS23_g27-28A.dita#IAS23_g27_28A" id="IFRS01_X1761" base="F15825289" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs 27 and 28 of IAS 23</xref>, as revised in 2007.</p></body></paragraph>
