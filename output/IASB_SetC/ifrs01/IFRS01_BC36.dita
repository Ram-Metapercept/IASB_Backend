Some argued that it would be inconsistent to use these carrying amounts as deemed cost in accordance with IFRSs, given that the IFRS does not permit the use of similar carrying amounts as deemed cost for assets and liabilities that were not acquired in a business combination. However, the Board identified no specific form of past business combination, and no specific form of accounting for past business combinations, for which it would not be acceptable to bring forward cost‑based measurements made in accordance with previous GAAP.</p></body></paragraph>
