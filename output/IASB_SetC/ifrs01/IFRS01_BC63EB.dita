This is because gathering the information for capitalisation of borrowing costs under IAS 23 and identifying and eliminating the amounts (if any) capitalised in past years under previous GAAP may be costly. In addition, the Board clarified that an entity should account for borrowing costs that are incurred after the date of transition and that relate to qualifying assets under construction at the date of transition in accordance with IAS 23, regardless of whether the entity capitalised or recognised in profit and loss borrowing costs under previous GAAP. The Board determined that this requirement would ensure useful information to users of financial statements. A first-time adopter could also choose to apply the requirements of IAS 23 from a date earlier than the date of transition, in which case it should account for borrowing costs in accordance with IAS 23 on or after the earlier date selected.</p></body></paragraph>
