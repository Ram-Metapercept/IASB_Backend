This alternative approach was intended mainly to help an entity that did not wish to use any of the exemptions proposed in ED 1 because it had already been accumulating information in accordance with IFRSs without presenting IFRS financial statements. To enable an entity using this approach to use the information it had already accumulated, ED 1 would have required it to consider superseded versions of IFRSs if more recent versions required prospective application. However, as explained in <xref href="IFRS01_BC28.dita#IFRS01_BC28" id="IFRS01_X1622" base="F15824461" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC28 and BC29</xref>, the Board abandoned ED 1’s all‑or‑nothing approach to exemptions. Because this eliminated the reason for the alternative approach, the Board deleted it in finalising the IFRS.</p></body></paragraph>
