However, in the light of respondents’ comments on the June 2011 exposure draft, the Board decided that an entity that meets the criteria for applying IFRS 1 and that has applied IFRSs in a previous reporting period (regardless of whether it used IFRS 1 or <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_number" class="- topic/ph ">SIC‑8</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">First-Time Application of IASs</ph></ph>, if either, when previously adopting) may choose to apply IFRS 1 when it re-adopts IFRSs. The Board decided that the entity should be allowed, rather than required, to apply IFRS 1 because, as explained in paragraph IN5 of IFRS 1, IFRS 1 grants limited exemptions from some requirements of IFRSs on the assumption that the cost of complying with some IFRSs would be likely to exceed the benefits to users of financial statements. However, the costs of applying IFRSs in full might not exceed the benefits of doing so for an entity that had previously applied IFRSs. Consequently, the Board concluded that an entity returning to IFRSs might determine that the benefits of applying IFRSs as if it had continued to do so without interruption would exceed the costs of preparing such information, and that an entity should not be prohibited from following that approach. In applying such an approach, an entity should apply IFRSs retrospectively in accordance with <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_number" class="- topic/ph ">IAS 8</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Accounting Policies, Changes in Estimates and Errors</ph></ph> as if the entity had never stopped applying IFRSs. The Board noted that hindsight is not applied by an entity in preparing IFRS financial statements, whether that entity is applying IFRS 1, or whether that entity applies IFRSs retrospectively as if the entity had never stopped applying them in accordance with IAS 8. The Board noted that paragraphs 14–17 of IFRS 1 and paragraph 53 of IAS 8 provide guidance in this regard.</p></body></paragraph>
