That fair value could then be used as the deemed cost in its opening IFRS statement of financial position. The Board believed that this approach would expand the scope of the deemed cost exemptions in IFRS 1 to enable them to be applied in these specific circumstances. However, because severe hyperinflation is a specific set of circumstances, the Board wanted to ensure that the fair value measurement option was applied only to those assets and liabilities that were held before the functional currency normalisation date, and not to other assets and liabilities held by the entity at the time it made the transition to IFRSs. Furthermore, where a parent entity’s functional currency has been subject to severe hyperinflation, but its subsidiary company’s functional currency has not been subject to severe hyperinflation, the Board decided it was inappropriate for such a subsidiary company to be able to apply this exemption.</p></body></paragraph>
