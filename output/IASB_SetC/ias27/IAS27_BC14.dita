This required an entity to recognise distributions as income only if they came from post‑acquisition retained earnings. Distributions received in excess of such retained earnings were regarded as a recovery of investment and were recognised as a reduction in the cost of the investment. To apply that method retrospectively upon first‑time adoption of IFRSs in its separate financial statements, an investor would need to know the subsidiary’s pre‑acquisition retained earnings in accordance with IFRSs.</p></body></paragraph>
