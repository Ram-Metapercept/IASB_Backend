Consequently, in those financial statements, such an investor is required to comply with the disclosure requirements in IFRS 12. As a logical consequence, such an investor is less likely to prepare separate financial statements in which investments in associates or joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. If such an investor presents separate financial statements, the Board expects that the investor is likely to account for its investments in associates or joint ventures either at cost or in accordance with IFRS 9.</p></body></paragraph>
