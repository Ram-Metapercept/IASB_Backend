The financial statements of such an investor in which the investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method would be the investor’s primary financial statements as well as its separate financial statements. Consequently, they assert that there could be confusion about the applicability of the disclosure requirements in IAS 27 and IFRS 12. IFRS 12 does not apply to an entity’s separate financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
