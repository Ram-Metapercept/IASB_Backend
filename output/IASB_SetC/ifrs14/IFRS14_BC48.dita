The results were discussed in a public discussion forum on <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Disclosures in Financial Reporting</ph></ph> in January 2013. The survey and the discussion forum were aimed at assisting the IASB to gain a clearer picture on the perceived “disclosure problem” (ie identifying disclosure requirements that create a burden for preparers but do not provide users with sufficient relevant information). The views of most financial statement preparers that took part in these events identified the primary problem as the disclosure requirements being too extensive, with not enough being done to exclude immaterial information, which has been referred to as “disclosure overload”. Similarly, many users of financial statements felt that preparers could do more to improve the communication of relevant information within the financial statements, rather than leaving users to sift through large amounts of data.</p></body></paragraph>
