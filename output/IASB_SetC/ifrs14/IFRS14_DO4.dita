They note that a major argument for this Standard is to avoid rate-regulated entities having to make a major change to their accounting policies when making the transition to IFRS (ie derecognise their regulatory deferral account balances in accordance with the current established practice in IFRS of almost all rate-regulated entities) until guidance can be developed through the comprehensive project on rate-regulated activities (see paragraph BC18). However, they also note that this argument is not new, and nor is it specific to this particular subject. Despite this argument, when developing major projects, the IASB does not usually introduce interim Standards to be applied only by first-time adopters of IFRS. In particular, the IASB did not decide to introduce an interim Standard when it worked on the Exposure Draft <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Rate-regulated Activities</ph></ph>, published in July 2009 (the ‘2009 ED’), which, at that time, would have equally avoided the issue for many entities in jurisdictions that have since adopted IFRS.</p></body></paragraph>
