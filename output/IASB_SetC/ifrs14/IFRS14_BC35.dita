However, it did not want to prevent entities that currently recognise regulatory deferral account balances from ceasing to recognise them when adopting IFRS because this would be consistent with the established IFRS practice. The IASB thinks that this would result in an entity presenting more comparable information with existing IFRS preparers, which would bring the financial statements closer to the criteria in IAS 8. The IASB has, therefore, decided that the continued recognition of regulatory deferral account balances in accordance with this Standard should be optional. An entity that is eligible to apply this Standard but that elects not to apply it and, consequently, ceases to recognise its regulatory deferral account balances, is not required to apply any of the disclosure requirements of this Standard. However, such entities, and other entities that are not eligible to apply this Standard, are not prohibited from providing supplementary disclosures, such as those set out in paragraphs 30–36.</p></body></paragraph>
