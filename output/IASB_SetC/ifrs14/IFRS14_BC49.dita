The IASB has previously concluded that it is unnecessary, in general, to state explicitly that specified disclosures relate only to material items because all Standards are governed by the concept of materiality as described in <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_number" class="- topic/ph ">IAS 1</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Presentation of Financial Statements</ph></ph> and in IAS 8. The IASB has decided, consistent with its previous conclusions, not to specifically refer to materiality in this Standard. However, this Standard contains other explicit guidance to clarify that preparers should use their judgement to decide which of the detailed items are necessary to achieve the objective and what level of detail to provide.</p></body></paragraph>
