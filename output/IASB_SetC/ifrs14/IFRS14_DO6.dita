Consequently, the IASB has stated that IFRS 14 does not anticipate the outcome of the comprehensive project, and uses the neutral term ‘regulatory deferral account balances’ instead of ‘regulatory assets’ and ‘regulatory liabilities’ (see paragraph BC21). However, Messrs Gomes and Zhang believe that permitting them to be included in the statement of financial position is equivalent to recognising them as assets and liabilities, which, in their view, is contrary to the current accounting principles in the <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> and the application of existing Standards.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
