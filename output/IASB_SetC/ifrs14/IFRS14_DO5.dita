Many of those members warned against setting a precedent of implementing a policy of adopting an interim solution whenever a major standard-setting project is activated. Messrs Edelmann, Gomes and Zhang are concerned that developing an interim solution in this situation might create uncertainty as to what the IASB’s approach might be when major projects are being researched in the future.</p></body></paragraph>
