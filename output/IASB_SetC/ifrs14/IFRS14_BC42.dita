Proponents of this alternative think that when regulatory assets are complementary to other assets and have similar useful lives, there is no need to incur the costs of separate accounting. Instead, they think that the other assets should be measured at the amount allowed for rate-regulatory purposes. In accordance with this alternative, an entity includes the regulatory deferral account balances in the cost of the asset that is recognised in accordance with other Standards as a single asset. This approach is consistent with that applied in US GAAP (Topic 980).</p></body></paragraph>
