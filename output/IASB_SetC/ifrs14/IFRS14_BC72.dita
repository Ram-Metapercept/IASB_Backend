Consequently, a rate-regulated entity is usually unable to react quickly in order to change its selling price in response to changes in its operating or other costs. Many of those who support the recognition of regulatory deferral account balances in financial statements argue that these balances provide some indication of the impact of these time delays on the cash flows that will be generated through future sales that will be made at a higher or lower price. The disclosures required by this Standard should provide more information about the amount and expected timing of the recovery or reversal of the regulatory deferral account balances recognised. </p></body></paragraph>
