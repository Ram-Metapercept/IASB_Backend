The IASB was persuaded by arguments from some respondents that this criterion was inconsistent with the underlying objective of the IASB to reduce barriers to the adoption of IFRS. In addition, retaining this criterion may be perceived as prejudging the outcome of the comprehensive project.</p></body></paragraph>
