The IASB acknowledges that rate regulators have different objectives for regulatory reporting than the IASB has for financial reporting. In the view of Messrs Gomes and Zhang, allowing regulatory deferral account balances to be recognised will effectively allow the objectives of the rate regulator(s) to take precedence over the objectives of general purpose financial reporting, as expressed in the <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph>. In particular, they believe that allowing regulatory deferral account balances to be recognised effectively allows the objectives of the rate regulator(s) for setting rates and smoothing out the volatility, which results from real economic events, to be reflected in the financial statements. Messrs Gomes and Zhang think that this is inconsistent with paragraph OB17 of the <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph>, which notes the importance of depicting the effects of transactions and other events and circumstances on a reporting entity’s economic resources and claims in the periods in which those effects occur, even if the resulting cash receipts and payments occur in a different period.</p></body></paragraph>
