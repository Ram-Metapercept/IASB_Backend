Consequently, and consistent with the IASB’s decision discussed in <xref href="IFRS14_BC43.dita#IFRS14_BC43" id="IFRS14_X0351" base="F33217503" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC43</xref>, the Standard requires the total of all regulatory deferral account debit balances and the total of all regulatory deferral account credit balances to be presented as separate line items in the statement of financial position. Similarly, the net movement between the opening and closing balances is presented separately within the statement(s) of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, split between amounts related to other comprehensive income and amounts related to profit or loss. Any movements not related to profit or loss or other comprehensive income, such as amounts acquired or disposed of, are disclosed in the reconciliation of opening and closing balances required by paragraph 33.</p></body></paragraph>
