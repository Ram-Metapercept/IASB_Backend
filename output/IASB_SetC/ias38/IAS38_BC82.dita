The Board acknowledged this point, but concluded that this does not provide a basis for subsuming those acquired intangible assets within goodwill. Rather, it highlights a need to reconsider the conclusion in the Standard that an intangible asset can never exist in respect of an in‑process research project and can exist in respect of an in‑process development project only once all of the Standard’s criteria for deferral have been satisfied. The Board decided that such a reconsideration is outside the scope of its Business Combinations project.</p></body></paragraph>
