Similarly, if an entity separately acquires a non‑contractual customer relationship, the existence of an exchange transaction for that relationship provides evidence both that the item is separable, and that the entity is able to control the expected future economic benefits flowing from the relationship. Therefore, the relationship would meet the intangible asset definition and be recognised as such. However, in the absence of exchange transactions for the same or similar non‑contractual customer relationships, such relationships acquired in a business combination would not normally meet the definition of an ‘intangible asset’—they would not be separable, nor would the entity be able to demonstrate that it controls the expected future economic benefits flowing from that relationship.</p></body></paragraph>
