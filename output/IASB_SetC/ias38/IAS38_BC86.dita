Some suggested that the requirements in the previous version of IAS 38 relating to expenditure on research, development, or the research or development phase of an internal project should be applied. However, others argued that those requirements were ostensibly concerned with the initial recognition and measurement of internally generated intangible assets. Instead, the requirements in the previous version of IAS 38 dealing with subsequent expenditure should be applied. Under those requirements, subsequent expenditure on an intangible asset after its purchase or completion would have been recognised as an expense when incurred unless: </p><ol outputclass="static" id="IAS38_L0082" base="SL142378" type="lower-alpha" class="- topic/ol "><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(a)</li_value> <p id="IAS38_P0648" base="SL142380" class="- topic/p ">it was probable that the expenditure would enable the asset to generate future economic benefits in excess of its originally assessed standard of performance; and</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(b)</li_value> <p id="IAS38_P0649" base="SL142382" class="- topic/p ">the expenditure could be measured and attributed to the asset reliably.</p></li></ol><p id="IAS38_P0650" base="SL142383" class="- topic/p ">If these conditions were satisfied, the subsequent expenditure would be added to the carrying amount of the intangible asset.</p></body></paragraph>
