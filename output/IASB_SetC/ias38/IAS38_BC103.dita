In particular, the Standard clarifies that in the absence of legal rights to protect customer relationships, exchange transactions for the same or similar non‑contractual customer relationships (other than as part of a business combination) provide evidence that the entity is nonetheless able to control the future economic benefits flowing from the customer relationships. Because such exchange transactions also provide evidence that the customer relationships are separable, those customer relationships meet the definition of an intangible asset (see <xref href="IAS38_gBC11-BC14.dita#IAS38_gBC11_BC14" id="IAS38_X0634" base="F16147010" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC11–BC14</xref>).</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(b)</li_value> <p id="IAS38_P0678" base="SL142409" class="- topic/p ">The Exposure Draft proposed that, except for an assembled workforce, an intangible asset acquired in a business combination should always be recognised separately from goodwill; there was a presumption that sufficient information would always exist to measure reliably its fair value. The Standard states that the fair value of an intangible asset acquired in a business combination can <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">normally</i> be measured with sufficient reliability to qualify for recognition separately from goodwill. If an intangible asset acquired in a business combination has a finite useful life, there is a rebuttable presumption that its fair value can be measured reliably (see <xref href="IAS38_gBC16-BC25.dita#IAS38_gBC16_BC25" id="IAS38_X0635" base="F16147011" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC16–BC25</xref>).</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(c)</li_value> <p id="IAS38_P0679" base="SL142411" class="- topic/p ">The Exposure Draft proposed, and the Standard requires, that the useful life of an intangible asset arising from contractual or other legal rights should not exceed the period of those rights. However, if the rights are conveyed for a limited term that can be renewed, the useful life should include the renewal period(s) only if there is evidence to support renewal by the entity without significant cost. Additional guidance has been included in the Standard to clarify the circumstances in which an entity should be regarded as being able to renew the contractual or other legal rights without significant cost (see <xref href="IAS38_gBC66-BC72.dita#IAS38_gBC66_BC72" id="IAS38_X0636" base="F16147012" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC66–BC72</xref>).</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
