The Board observed that amending the requirements in the previous version of IAS 38 only for intangible assets acquired in business combinations would create inconsistencies in the accounting for intangible assets depending on how they are obtained. Thus, similar items would be accounted for in dissimilar ways. The Board concluded that creating such inconsistencies would impair the usefulness of the information provided to users about an entity’s intangible assets, because both comparability and reliability (which rests on the notion of representational faithfulness, ie that similar transactions are accounted for in the same way) would be diminished. Therefore, the Board decided that any amendments to the requirements in the previous version of IAS 38 to address the issues in (b) and (c) of <xref href="IAS38_BC47.dita#IAS38_BC47" id="IAS38_X0579" base="F16146851" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC47</xref> should apply to all recognised intangible assets, whether generated internally or acquired separately or as part of a business combination.</p></body></paragraph>
