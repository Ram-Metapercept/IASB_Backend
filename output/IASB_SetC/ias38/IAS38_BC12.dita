Exchange transactions for the same asset or a similar asset provide evidence of separability of a non‑contractual customer relationship and might also provide information about exchange prices that should be considered when estimating fair value.’ Whilst respondents to the Exposure Draft generally agreed with the Board’s conclusions on the definition of identifiability, some were uncertain about the relationship between the separability criterion for establishing whether a non‑contractual customer relationship is identifiable, and the control concept for establishing whether the relationship meets the definition of an asset. Additionally, some respondents suggested that non‑contractual customer relationships would, under the proposal in the Exposure Draft, be separately recognised if acquired in a business combination, but not if acquired in a separate transaction.</p></body></paragraph>
