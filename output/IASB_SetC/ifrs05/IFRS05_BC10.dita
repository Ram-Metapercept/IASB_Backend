The Board decided to clarify in IFRS 5 that assets classified as non‑current are not reclassified as current assets until they meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale in accordance with the IFRS.  Further, assets of a class that an entity would normally regard as non‑current and are acquired exclusively with a view to resale are not classified as current unless they meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale in accordance with the IFRS. </p></body></paragraph>
