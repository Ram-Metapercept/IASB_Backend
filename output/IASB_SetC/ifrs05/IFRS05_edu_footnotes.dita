Specifically, the question was whether the allocation of an impairment loss recognised for a disposal group can reduce the carrying amount of non-current assets that are within the scope of the measurement requirements of IFRS 5 to an amount that is lower than their fair value less costs of disposal or their value in use. In analysing this issue, the Interpretations Committee considered a situation in which the carrying amount of such non-current assets is not less than the amount of the impairment loss, and did not consider the implications for allocating an impairment loss if that loss exceeds the carrying amount of such non-current assets.</p>       <p class="- topic/p ">The Interpretations Committee noted that paragraph 23 of IFRS 5 addresses the recognition of impairment losses for a disposal group. It also noted that in determining the order of allocation of impairment losses to non-current assets that are within the scope of the measurement requirements of that Standard, paragraph 23 refers to paragraphs 104 and 122 of IAS 36 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Impairment of Assets</ph></ph>, which set out requirements regarding the order of allocation of impairment losses. However, it does not refer to paragraph 105 of IAS 36, which restricts the impairment losses allocated to individual assets by requiring that an asset is not written down to less than the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal, its value in use and zero. Consequently, the Interpretations Committee observed that the restriction in paragraph 105 of IAS 36 does not apply when allocating an impairment loss for a disposal group to the non-current assets that are within the scope of the measurement requirements of IFRS 5. The Interpretations Committee understood this to mean that the amount of impairment that should be recognised for a disposal group would not be restricted by the fair value less costs of disposal or value in use of those non-current assets that are within the scope of the measurement requirements of IFRS 5.</p>       <p class="- topic/p ">In the light of existing IFRS requirements, the Interpretations Committee determined that neither an Interpretation nor an amendment to a Standard was necessary.
