Furthermore, the Board agreed with the FASB that the cash flows arising from the asset’s remaining use were incidental to the recovery of the asset through sale and, hence, concluded that individual assets classified as held for sale should be measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and should not be depreciated.</p></body></paragraph>
