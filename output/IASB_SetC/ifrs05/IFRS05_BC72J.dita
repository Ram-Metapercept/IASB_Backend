Consequently, the determination of the 12-month period should not restart when such a change in the method of disposal occurs, but should instead continue to be the same as initially determined by management in its assessment of whether the sale and/or distribution to owners is highly probable. The Board also noted that the period required to complete a sale or distribution to owners can be extended if the conditions in paragraph 9 of IFRS 5 are met. The Board noted that when an entity changes its planned method of disposal via a direct reclassification, it does not restate prior periods to reflect the new method of disposal.</p></body></paragraph>
