Loss of control is a significant economic event that changes the nature of an investment. The parent‑subsidiary relationship ceases to exist and an investor‑investee relationship begins that differs significantly from the former parent‑subsidiary relationship. Therefore, the new investor‑investee relationship is recognised and measured initially at the date when control is lost.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
