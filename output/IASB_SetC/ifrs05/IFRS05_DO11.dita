The concept ‘retired from active use’ would have been simple to apply and management intentions would be removed from the Standard. The classification would equally apply to any form of disposal (sale, abandonment, exchange, spin‑off etc); no detailed (anti‑abuse) rules and no illustrations would be necessary and the Standard would be simple and based on a clear and unambiguous principle. Mr Schmid, on this point, does not agree with the conclusions in <xref href="IFRS05_BC18.dita#IFRS05_BC18" id="IFRS05_X0516" base="F15830954" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC18</xref> that a classification ‘retired from active use’ would not require fewer criteria to support it than the category ‘assets held for sale’.</p></body></paragraph>
