Others noted that future actuarial losses might reduce or eliminate the surplus. In either case there would be no refund or reduction in future contributions. The IFRIC noted that the existence of an asset at the <u class="+ topic/ph hi-d/u ">end of the reporting period</u> <line-through class="+ topic/ph hi-d/line-through ">balance sheet date</line-through> depends on whether the entity has the right to obtain a refund or reduction in future contributions. The existence of the asset at that date is not affected by possible future changes to the amount of the surplus. If future events occur that change the amount of the surplus, their effects are recognised when they occur. Accordingly, if the entity decides to improve benefits, or future losses in the plan reduce the surplus, the consequences are recognised when the decision is made or the losses occur. The IFRIC noted that such events of future periods do not affect the existence or measurement of the asset at the <u class="+ topic/ph hi-d/u ">end of the reporting period</u> <line-through class="+ topic/ph hi-d/line-through ">balance sheet date</line-through>.</p></body></paragraph>
