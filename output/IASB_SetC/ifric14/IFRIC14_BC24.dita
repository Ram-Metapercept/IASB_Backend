The IFRIC noted that there is an implicit assumption in <xref href="../ias19/IAS19_TOC0001.dita#IAS19_TOC0001" id="IFRIC14_X0087" base="F49287177" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 19</xref> that the specified assumptions represent the best estimate of the eventual outcome of the plan in economic terms, while a requirement to make additional contributions is often a prudent approach designed to build in a risk margin for adverse circumstances. Moreover, when there are no members left in the plan, the minimum funding requirement would have no effect. This would leave the IAS 19 surplus available. To the extent that the entity has a right to this eventual surplus, the IAS 19 surplus would be available to the entity, regardless of the minimum funding restrictions in force at the <u class="+ topic/ph hi-d/u ">end of the reporting period</u> <line-through class="+ topic/ph hi-d/line-through ">balance sheet date</line-through>. The IFRIC therefore concluded that the existence of a minimum funding requirement may affect the timing of a refund but does not affect whether it is ultimately available to the entity.</p></body></paragraph>
