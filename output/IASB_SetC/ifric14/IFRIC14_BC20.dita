The IFRIC disagreed with that view. The IFRIC noted that the entity could derive economic benefit from a reduction in contributions beyond that period. The IFRIC also noted that increasing the term of the calculation has a decreasing effect on the incremental changes to the asset because the reductions in contributions are discounted to a present value. Thus, for plans with a large surplus and no possibility of receiving a refund, the available asset will be limited even if the term of the calculation extends beyond the expected future working lifetime of the active membership to the expected life of the plan. This is consistent with <xref href="../ias19/IAS19_BC77.dita#IAS19_BC77" id="IFRIC14_X0085" base="F78010884" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC77 of the Basis for Conclusions on IAS 19</xref>,<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRIC14_FN0006" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/> which states that ‘the limit [on the measurement of the defined benefit asset] is likely to come into play <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">only</i> where … the plan is very mature and has a very large surplus that is more than large enough to eliminate <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">all</i> future contributions and cannot be returned to the entity’ (emphasis added). If the contribution reduction were determined by considering only the term of the expected future working lifetime of the active membership, the limit on the measurement of the defined benefit asset would come into play much more frequently.</p></body></paragraph>
