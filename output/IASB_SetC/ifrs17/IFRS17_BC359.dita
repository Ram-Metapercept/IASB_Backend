This consideration may differ from premiums from new contracts generated or cash collected. The Board noted, therefore, that the use of accruals-based accounting for any contract initiated in advance of services provided (ie any contract for which the performance obligation is not satisfied in the period in which the contract is written) can result in revenue increasing even if the volume of new contracts issued decreased. The Board noted that this effect is not unique to insurance contracts and sought to identify other ways to provide useful information regarding an entity’s growth.</p></body></paragraph>
