These activities included establishing a Transition Resource Group for IFRS 17 to discuss implementation questions, and meeting with stakeholders affected by the changes introduced by IFRS 17, including preparers and users of financial statements, auditors and regulators. These activities helped the Board to understand the concerns and challenges that arose for some entities while implementing the Standard. In the light of these activities, the Board concluded that the costs of proposing targeted amendments to IFRS 17 to address concerns and challenges could be justified if those amendments would not change the fundamental principles of the Standard. The Board considered suggestions to amend the Standard in relation to 25 topics.</p></body></paragraph>
