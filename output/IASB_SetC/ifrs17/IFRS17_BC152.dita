Many previous insurance accounting models attributed no value to embedded options or guarantees that lack ‘intrinsic value’ (ie when they were ‘out of the money’). However, such embedded options and guarantees also have a time value because they could be ‘in the money’ at expiry. To the extent that those options and guarantees remain embedded in the insurance contract (see <xref href="IFRS17_gBC104-BC107.dita#IFRS17_gBC104_BC107/IFRS17_gBC104_BC107_TI" id="IFRS17_X1597" base="F59369315" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC104–BC107</xref>), the expected present value of future cash flows is an estimate based on all possible outcomes about cash flows. IFRS 17 also requires the measurement to include the effect of financial risk, either in the estimates of future cash flows or in the discount rate. The measurement approach in IFRS 17, therefore, incorporates both the intrinsic value and the time value of embedded options and guarantees. The use of the IFRS 17 approach will mean that the measurement of any options and guarantees included in the insurance contracts is consistent with observable market variables (see <xref href="IFRS17_B48.dita#IFRS17_B48" id="IFRS17_X1598" base="F59369356" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph B48 of IFRS 17</xref>). The Board concluded that this measurement approach provides the most relevant information about embedded options and guarantees.</p></body></paragraph>
