However, the Board noted that entities are required to make similar assessments for insurance contracts with direct participation features and for contracts that provide more than one type of insurance coverage. Furthermore, any additional subjectivity and complexity would be mitigated by the related disclosure required by paragraph 109 of IFRSâ€¯17, which provides users of financial statements with useful information about the pattern of service provision.</p></body></paragraph>
