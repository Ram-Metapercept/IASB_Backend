Consistent accounting includes measuring the expected value of all the entity’s rights and obligations arising from a contract. When an entity holds a reinsurance contract that provides the entity with a substantive right to receive reinsurance coverage for insurance contracts it expects to issue, cash flows arising from that substantive right are included in the measurement of the reinsurance contract held (that is, those cash flows are within the boundary of the reinsurance contract held applying paragraph 34 of IFRS 17). In contrast, if a reinsurance contract held provides an entity with neither substantive rights nor substantive obligations relating to insurance contracts it expects to issue, those insurance contracts would be outside the boundary of the reinsurance contract held. The requirements for expected future cash flows in paragraphs 33−35 of IFRS 17 form a core aspect of the Standard. The Board identified no reason for these requirements to be applied inconsistently—they should be applied both to insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held.</p></body></paragraph>
