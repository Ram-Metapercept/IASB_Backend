This is not because other services are considered in determining insurance revenue, but rather because inserting that defined term there might be interpreted as prohibiting an entity from recognising insurance revenue unrelated to the contractual service margin before the coverage period begins. Insurance revenue can be analysed as consisting of the amount of the contractual service margin allocated to the period, the release of the risk adjustment for non-financial risk in the period and the expenses the entity expected to incur in the period. Some insurance contracts include a pre-coverage period, between the date the contract is recognised and the date the entity first provides insurance contract services. In contracts with a pre-coverage period, an entity may be released from non-financial risk, or may incur expenses before the coverage period begins—in other words, before the entity starts providing insurance contract services. The Board did not want to preclude an entity from recognising the related insurance revenue in that pre-coverage period.</p></body></paragraph>
