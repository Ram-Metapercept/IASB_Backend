However, an entity is required to separate and apply IFRS 17 to an insurance coverage component if, and only if, that component is a contractual term of that financial instrument. In the Board’s view, applying IFRS 17 to those insurance coverage components will result in the most useful information for users of financial statements. Applying IFRS 17 to those components will also increase comparability between insurance coverage provided as part of the contractual terms of a credit card contract and insurance coverage provided as a separate stand-alone contract. Other IFRS Standards, such as IFRS 15 or IAS 37, might apply to other components of the contract, such as other service components or insurance components required by law or regulation.</p></body></paragraph>
