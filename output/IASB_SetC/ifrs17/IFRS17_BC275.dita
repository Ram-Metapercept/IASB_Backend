When measuring the fulfilment cash flows, these changes in estimates are measured consistently with all other aspects of the fulfilment cash flows using a current discount rate. However, the contractual service margin is determined using the discount rate that applies on initial recognition. To make the contractual service margin internally consistent, the Board decided that the adjustments for changes in estimates of future cash flows also need to be measured at the rate that applied on initial recognition. This leads to a difference between the change in the fulfilment cash flows and the adjustment to the contractual service margin—the difference between the change in the future cash flows measured at a current rate and the change in the future cash flows measured at the rate that had applied on initial recognition. That difference gives rise to a gain or loss that is included in profit or loss or other comprehensive income, depending on the accounting policy choice an entity makes for the presentation of insurance finance income or expenses.</p></body></paragraph>
