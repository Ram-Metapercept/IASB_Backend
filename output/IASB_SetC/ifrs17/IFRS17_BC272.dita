In the Board’s view, on initial recognition the contractual service margin can be viewed as an allocation of part of the transaction price, which is the consideration paid or payable by the policyholder. Calculating interest on the contractual service margin is consistent with <xref href="../ifrs14/IFRS15_TOC.dita#IFRS15_TOC0001/IFRS15_TOC0001_V2" base="F59389052" id="IFRS17_X1717" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 15</xref>, which requires an entity to adjust the promised consideration to reflect the time value of money if the contract has a significant financing component. As a result of that adjustment, the transaction price would reflect the amount the customer would pay in cash for the promised good or service when they receive the good or service. Consequently, an entity would recognise revenue at an amount that corresponds to the cash selling price of the good or service, with the effects of the financing presented separately from revenue (as interest expense or interest income).</p></body></paragraph>
