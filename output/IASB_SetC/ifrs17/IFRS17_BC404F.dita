The Board concluded that a two-year deferral should allow time for an orderly adoption of the amended IFRS 17 by jurisdictions. It should therefore enable more entities to initially apply IFRS 17 around the same time for the benefit of users of financial statements. The additional yearâ€™s deferral compared to that proposed in the 2019 Exposure Draft should also assist those entities for whom implementing IFRS 17 by 2022 would have been challenging, including those entities for whom implementation projects were affected by the covid-19 pandemic in 2020. The deferral should thereby help to improve the quality of the initial application of the Standard.</p></body></paragraph>
