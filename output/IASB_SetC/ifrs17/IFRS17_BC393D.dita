These stakeholders thought such an amendment would avoid the risk       of hindsight. The Board considered what an ‘all or nothing’ approach would be and whether the       Board should add such an approach to the IFRS 17 transition requirements. The Board noted that       an ‘all or nothing’ approach would require:</p><ol outputclass="static" class="- topic/ol "><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(a)</li_value><p class="- topic/p ">‘all’ to mean all insurance contracts issued by the entity that exist at the transition date (that is, all would be at a reporting entity level);</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(b)</li_value><p class="- topic/p ">‘all’ to mean all past and current risk mitigation relationships that meet the criteria in paragraph B116 of IFRS 17 at any point between initial recognition of a group of insurance contracts and the transition date;</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(c)</li_value><p class="- topic/p ">an entity to hold historical documentation of each of those risk mitigation relationships described in (b), and that documentation to have existed at the beginning of the first reporting period that the entity would have met the criteria in paragraph B116 of IFRS 17; and</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(d)</li_value><p class="- topic/p ">an entity to retrospectively determine the effect of applying the risk mitigation option for all relationships described in (b) at each reporting date between initial recognition of a group of insurance contracts and the transition date.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
