Accordingly, the Board decided to provide a transition relief so that entities would not need to divide contracts into groups of contracts that were written within one year. In addition, entities are allowed to accrete and adjust the resulting contractual service margin after transition using the discount rates at the transition date. Furthermore, the Board decided that entities that choose to disaggregate insurance finance income or expenses between profit or loss and other comprehensive income in accordance with <xref href="IFRS17_88.dita#IFRS17_88" id="IFRS17_X1894" base="F59415867" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs 88(b)</xref> and <xref href="IFRS17_89.dita#IFRS17_89" id="IFRS17_X1895" base="F59415868" class="- topic/xref ">89(b) of IFRS 17</xref> should be permitted to determine insurance finance income or expenses included in profit or loss using the discount rates at the transition date. Although this results in a different accumulated balance in equity compared with the amount that would result from a full retrospective approach, and hence different insurance finance income or expenses in profit or loss in the future, the Board concluded that users of financial statements could be alerted to these differences through disclosures.</p></body></paragraph>
