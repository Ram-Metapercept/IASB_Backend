As explained in <xref href="IFRS17_gBC228-BC231.dita#IFRS17_gBC228_BC231/IFRS17_gBC228_BC231_TI" id="IFRS17_X1704" base="F59389017" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC228–BC231</xref>, the Board concluded that for many insurance contracts it is appropriate to depict the gains and losses on any investment portfolio related to the contracts in the same way as gains and losses on an investment portfolio unrelated to insurance contracts. However, the Board also considered a contrasting view that, for some contracts, the returns to the entity from a pool of underlying items should be viewed as the compensation that the entity charges the policyholder for service provided by the insurance contract, rather than as a share of returns from an unrelated investment. Under this contrasting view, changes in the estimate of the entity’s share of returns are regarded as a change in the entity’s compensation for the contract. Such changes in the entity’s compensation should be recognised over the periods in which the entity provides the service promised in the contract, in the same way that changes in the estimates of the costs of providing the contract are recognised.</p></body></paragraph>
