Otherwise, changes in underlying items could adjust the contractual service margin of insurance contracts without direct participation features. The Board considered a view that the effects of changes in cash flows resulting from the participation in underlying items that are not solely financial in nature (for example, insurance contracts) should be presented within the insurance service result, instead of within insurance finance income or expenses. The Board disagreed with this view because the requirement to reflect changes from participation in underlying items in insurance finance income or expenses appropriately depicts the nature of the participation—as an investment. The Board concluded that policyholder participation in underlying items, including underlying items that are not solely financial in nature such as insurance contracts, should have no effect on the depiction of the entity’s insurance service result. Further, splitting the effect of changes in cash flows resulting from the participation in underlying items that are not solely financial in nature into an amount that should be included in the insurance service result and an amount that should be included in insurance finance income or expenses would be complex and could disrupt implementation for some entities.</p></body></paragraph>
