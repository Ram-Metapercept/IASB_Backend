The insurance finance result reflects the interest arising on the group of insurance contracts because of the passage of time and the effect of changes in assumptions relating to financial risk. The statement(s) of financial performance also reflect gains and losses from the investments in which the premiums are invested. Such gains and losses would be recognised in profit or loss according to other applicable IFRS Standards.</p></body></paragraph>
