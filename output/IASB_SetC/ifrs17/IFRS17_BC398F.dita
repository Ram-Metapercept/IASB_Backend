In June 2020, the Board also added a scope exclusion in paragraph 7(h) of IFRS 17 for some contracts that provide credit or payment arrangements such as particular credit card contracts (see paragraphs BC94A‒BC94C). Stakeholders said that, for such contracts, many entities already apply IFRS 9 to the credit or payment arrangement component applying the separation requirements in IFRS 4. However, some may not have. Accordingly, the transition requirements discussed in paragraphs BC398A‒BC398E will apply if an entity has already applied IFRS 9 but has not applied IFRS 9 to those components.</p></body></paragraph>
