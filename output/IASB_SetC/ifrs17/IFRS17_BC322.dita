It also considered concerns that an entity might be unable to derecognise those liabilities. Some argued that, in some cases, the delayed derecognition would result in unreasonable and unduly burdensome accounting. In the Board’s view, ignoring contractual obligations that remain in existence and that can generate valid claims would not give a faithful representation of an entity’s financial position. However, the Board expects that when the entity has no information to suggest there are unasserted claims on a contract with an expired coverage period, the entity would measure the insurance contract liability at a very low amount. Accordingly, there may be little practical difference between recognising an insurance liability measured at a very low amount and derecognising the liability.</p></body></paragraph>
