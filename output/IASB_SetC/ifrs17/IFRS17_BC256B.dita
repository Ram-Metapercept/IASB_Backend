The entity accounts for the underlying insurance contracts issued, but not the reinsurance contract held, applying the variable fee approach. Reinsurance contracts that cover insurance contracts with direct participation features transfer both non-financial and financial risk to the reinsurer. The Board considered but rejected a suggestion to permit an entity to apply the variable fee approach to such reinsurance contracts held (see paragraph BC249C). However, the Board acknowledged that when an entity mitigates the effect of financial risk using a reinsurance contract held, an accounting mismatch could arise that is similar to the mismatch that could arise when an entity mitigates the effect of financial risk using derivatives (see paragraph BC252). Accordingly, the Board amended IFRS 17 so that the risk mitigation option applies in the same way when an entity uses reinsurance contracts held as when an entity uses derivatives.</p></body></paragraph>
