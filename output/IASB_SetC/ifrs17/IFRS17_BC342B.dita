They would rather IFRS 17 required one consistent presentation. The Board acknowledged that requiring entities to report insurance finance income or expenses entirely in profit or loss instead of permitting the choice in paragraphs 88−89 of IFRS 17 would improve comparability between entities. However, consistent with the Board’s previous conclusion explained in paragraph BC340, the Board concluded that the presentation of insurance finance income or expenses as a systematic allocation in profit or loss may provide more useful information than total insurance finance income or expenses in profit or loss for some contracts and less useful information for other contracts.</p></body></paragraph>
