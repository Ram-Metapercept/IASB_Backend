Hence, for example, the measurement required by Solvency II, a regulation adopted by the European Union, is broadly consistent with the measurement of the fulfilment cash flows required by IFRS 17. However, Solvency II does not consider the determination or reporting of an entity’s financial performance over time, which under IFRS 17 is achieved through the contractual service margin.</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS17_P5797" base="F55750896" class="- topic/p ">regulatory requirements may include simplifications and practical expedients that are appropriate in the context of the regulatory regime in which they were developed, but which may not be appropriate in an international financial reporting environment.</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS17_P5798" base="F55750898" class="- topic/p ">regulatory reporting frequently includes jurisdiction‑specific requirements, which accommodate issues specific to that jurisdiction, including policy objectives.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
