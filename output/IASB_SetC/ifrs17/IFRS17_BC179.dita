In contrast, IFRS 15 requires an entity to recognise as revenue the consideration received from the customer as it satisfies its performance obligations under the contract. Accordingly, the Board decided to include an exception in IFRS 17 for the treatment of insurance acquisition cash flows so that the premium related to insurance acquisition cash flows is not recognised as revenue when the insurance acquisition cash flows occur, but is separately identified and recognised over the coverage period. IFRS 17 also requires the insurance acquisition cash flows to be recognised as an expense over the same period.</p></body></paragraph>
