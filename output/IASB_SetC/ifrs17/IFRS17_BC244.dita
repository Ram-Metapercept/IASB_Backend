In such cases, the fact that the fee for the contract is determined by reference to a share of the returns on the underlying items is incidental to its nature as a fee. The Board concluded, therefore, that depicting the gains and losses on the entity’s share of the underlying items as part of a variable fee for service faithfully represents the nature of the contractual arrangement.</p></body></paragraph>
