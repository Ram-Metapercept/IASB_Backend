Also, a locked-in rate requires information about historical rates that would not otherwise be needed for entities not using the option to include insurance finance income or expenses in profit or loss using a systematic allocation (see <xref href="IFRS17_BC42.dita#IFRS17_BC42" id="IFRS17_X1718" base="F59389053" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC42–BC44</xref>). However, the Board noted that accreting interest on the contractual service margin for an accounting period at a current rate differs from measuring cash flows at a current rate. The contractual service margin does not represent future cash flows; it represents the unearned profit in the contract, measured at the point of initial recognition and adjusted only for specified amounts. For insurance contracts without direct participation features, the contractual service margin is not adjusted (remeasured) for changes in interest rates for the reasons set out in <xref href="IFRS17_gBC228-BC231.dita#IFRS17_gBC228_BC231/IFRS17_gBC228_BC231_TI" id="IFRS17_X1719" base="F59389095" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC228–BC231</xref>. Accreting interest for a period at a current rate without also remeasuring the contractual service margin at the start of the period would create an internally inconsistent measurement of the contractual service margin.</p></body></paragraph>
