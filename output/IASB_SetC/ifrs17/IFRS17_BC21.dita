It depicts the profit                 that the entity expects to earn by providing the services promised under the                 contracts in the group over the duration of the coverage of the group.<xref type="fn" keyref="footnotes/IFRS17_BC21_FN0001" class="- topic/xref "/> Accordingly, IFRS 17 does not                 permit the entity to recognise that excess as a gain on initial recognition, but                 instead requires the entity to recognise that gain as the entity satisfies its                 obligation to provide services over the coverage period. However, if a group of                 contracts is onerous on initial recognition, IFRS 17 requires an entity to recognise                 a loss immediately (see <xref href="IFRS17_gBC284-BC287.dita#IFRS17_gBC284_BC287/IFRS17_gBC284_BC287_TI" base="F59357609" id="IFRS17_X1390" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC284</xref>). Accordingly, if a group of contracts                 is onerous on initial recognition, no contractual service margin would be                 recognised. This reflects the Board’s view that the carrying amount of a group of                 insurance contracts should reflect the obligation of the entity to provide future                 service, and that amount should be at least equal to the fulfilment cash flows. This                 is consistent with the approach to the recognition of profits and losses on                 contracts with customers required in <xref href="../ifrs14/IFRS15_TOC.dita#IFRS15_TOC0001/IFRS15_TOC0001_V2" base="F59357610" id="IFRS17_X1391" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 15</xref>.</p>         </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
