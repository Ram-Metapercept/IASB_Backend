In response to that feedback, in December 2021, the Board       issued <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Initial Application of           IFRS 17 and IFRS 9—Comparative Information</ph></ph>. The Board concluded that amending       IFRS 17 to enable entities to reduce those mismatches close to the effective date would not       disrupt implementation. The amendment could be finalised in a timely manner, would be optional       and would relate only to the presentation of comparative information on initial application of       IFRS 17.</p></body></paragraph>
