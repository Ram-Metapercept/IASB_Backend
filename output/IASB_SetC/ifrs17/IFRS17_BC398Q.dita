The       Board therefore decided to make the classification overlay available for comparative periods       for which information has been restated applying IFRS 17. This decision is consistent with the       objective of the classification overlay, which is to enable entities to reduce accounting       mismatches between financial assets and insurance contract liabilities that may arise in the       comparative information presented on initial application of IFRS 17. <xref href="../ias08/IAS08_TOC.dita" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 8</xref> does not allow the use of hindsight when an       entity applies a new accounting policy to a prior period. Therefore, an entity would collect       relevant information on a timely basis to apply the classification overlay to the comparative       periods without the use of hindsight.</p></body></paragraph>
