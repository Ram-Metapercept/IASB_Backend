That means that some of the amounts based on underlying items may be paid to policyholders of contracts that will be issued in the future that share in the returns on the same underlying items, rather than to existing policyholders. From the entity’s perspective, the terms of the existing contract require it to pay the amounts, even though it does not yet know when or to whom it will make the payments.</p></body></paragraph>
