Insurance measurement models before IFRS 17 often required entities to make estimates at initial recognition and to use the same estimates throughout the duration of the contract, without updating to include information that became available later in the duration of the contract.

Any liability adequacy test is likely to involve some arbitrary components. For example, any specified timing for such a test would inevitably be arbitrary, unless current information were required at each reporting date.</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(c)</li_value> <p base="F55751572" id="IFRS17_P6089" class="- topic/p ">is broadly consistent with other IFRS Standards for provisions (<xref href="../ias37/IAS37_TOC.dita#IAS37_TOC0001" base="F59369361" id="IFRS17_X1603" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 37</xref>) and financial liabilities (<xref href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_TOC.dita#IFRS09_TOC0001" base="F70527930" id="IFRS17_X1604" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 9</xref>).
