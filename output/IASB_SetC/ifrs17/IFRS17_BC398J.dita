The Board       concluded that this expected IFRS 9 classification and measurement should be determined at the       transition date to IFRS 17 to enable entities to prepare to apply the classification overlay.       The Board concluded that entities could make this determination by using reasonable and       supportable information available at the transition date. As an example, an entity could use       preliminary assessments of the business model and cash flow characteristics performed to       prepare for the initial application of IFRS 9.</p></body></paragraph>
