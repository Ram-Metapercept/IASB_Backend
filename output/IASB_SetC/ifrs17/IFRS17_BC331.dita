Investment components may be more significant in some contracts than in others. For example, significant investment components exist in many long-term life insurance contracts and in some large long-term or bespoke non-life insurance or reinsurance contracts. Some argued that any attempt to distinguish between investment components that have not been separated and the premium charged for insurance and other services would be arbitrary and complex to apply.</p></body></paragraph>
