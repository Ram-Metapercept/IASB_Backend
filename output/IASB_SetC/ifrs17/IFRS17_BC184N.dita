In addition the Board concluded that, to be consistent with the recognition of insurance revenue and incurred expenses required by IFRS 17, to the extent that an asset is derecognised when the entity recognises the related group of insurance contracts, insurance revenue and expenses should be recognised. In contrast, no insurance revenue or expenses arise on the derecognition of a liability at that date. The derecognition of a liability results either in the amounts expected to settle the liability being included in the fulfilment cash flows or the performance obligation depicted by the liability being subsumed within the recognition of the group of insurance contracts. For example, an entity that recognised a liability for premiums received in advance of the recognition of a group of insurance contracts would derecognise that liability when the entity recognises a group of insurance contracts to the extent the premiums relate to the contracts in the group. The performance obligation that was depicted by the liability would not be recognised separately from the group of insurance contracts had the premiums been received on the date of the initial recognition of the group. No insurance revenue arises on the derecognition of the liability.</p></body></paragraph>
