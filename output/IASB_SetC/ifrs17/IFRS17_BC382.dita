Such assessments might be impossible without the use of hindsight (ie making an assumption         of what an entity would have expected in the past). The need for hindsight could be avoided         if the assessments were made at the transition date instead of at the date of inception or         initial recognition of the contract. However, the Board noted that assessing contracts only         at the transition date could impose grouping for entities that is significantly different         from an assessment as at the date of the inception or initial recognition of the contract.         Accordingly, the Board decided that entities should be allowed to make the assessments         either:</p>       <ol outputclass="static" id="IFRS17_L0556" base="F55754467" type="lower-alpha" class="- topic/ol "><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(a)</li_value>           <p id="IFRS17_P6534" base="F55754468" class="- topic/p ">at the date of inception or initial recognition of a             contract, if such assessments could be made based on reasonable and supportable evidence             for what the entity would have determined given the terms of the contract and the market             conditions at that time; or</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(b)</li_value>           <p id="IFRS17_P6535" base="F55754470" class="- topic/p ">at the transition date.<xref type="fn" keyref="footnotes/IFRS17_BC382_FN0001" class="- topic/xref "/></p></li></ol>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
