However, there is no way to specify the scope of the exemption other than by using arbitrary thresholds because the balance of costs and benefits for different contracts vary across a range and there is no clearly identifiable point at which the costs exceed the benefits. Entities would be able to avoid applying the annual cohort requirement by structuring contracts to meet those thresholds. The Board concluded there was a high risk that contracts for which the benefits of the annual cohort requirement heavily outweigh the costs would be included in the exemption, resulting in a loss of information critical for users of financial statements.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
