An example of such a contract is one that requires payments in response to changes in a specified credit rating or credit index. The Board concluded that those contracts are derivatives and do not meet the definition of an insurance contract. Therefore, such contracts will continue to be accounted for as derivatives. The Board noted that these contracts were outside the scope of the policy choice in IFRS 4 carried forward in IFRS 17, so continuing to account for them as derivatives would not create further diversity.</p></body></paragraph>
