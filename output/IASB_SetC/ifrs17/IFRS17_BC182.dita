For example, there would be different liabilities reported if the entity had an internal sales department rather than outsourcing sales to external agents. In the Board’s view, differences in the structure of insurance acquisition activities would not necessarily reflect economic differences between insurance contracts issued by the entities.</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS17_P6137" base="F55751671" class="- topic/p ">an entity typically prices insurance contracts to recover not only incremental costs, but also other direct costs and a proportion of indirect costs incurred in originating insurance contracts—such as costs of underwriting, medical tests and inspection, and issuing the policy. The entity measures and manages these costs for the portfolio, rather than for the individual contract. Accordingly, including insurance acquisition cash flows that are incremental at the portfolio level in the fulfilment cash flows of the insurance contracts would be consistent with identification of other cash flows that are included in the measurement of the contracts.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
