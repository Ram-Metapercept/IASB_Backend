In addition, some preparers and regulators were concerned that when the underlying items are measured at cost, the carrying value of the insurance contract would not be a current value. As a result, mirroring would widen the difference between the liability measured for financial reporting purposes and the liability recognised for regulatory purposes.</p></body></paragraph>
