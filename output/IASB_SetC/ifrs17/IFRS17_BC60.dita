For users of financial statements, complexity may arise from the need to understand how gains and losses arising from events of previous years affect current-year profit or loss. For preparers of financial statements, complexity arises from the need to identify the changes in estimates of future cash flows that adjust the contractual service margin separately from changes in estimates that do not adjust the contractual service margin. For both, a particular source of complexity arises from the distinction between changes in estimates relating to future service and changes relating to past service. That distinction may be subjective and may vary according to when the entity makes the change in estimate. An entity adjusts the contractual service margin for a change in estimates of cash flows that is made before the cash flows occur. In contrast, the entity recognises an experience adjustment in profit or loss and does not adjust the contractual service margin if there is no change in estimate before the cash flows occur. However, in the light of the feedback received, the Board concluded that adjusting the contractual service margin for changes in future service provides relevant information about the unearned profit in the group of insurance contracts and is consistent with the approach in <xref href="../ifrs14/IFRS15_TOC.dita#IFRS15_TOC0001/IFRS15_TOC0001_V2" base="F59357913" id="IFRS17_X1451" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 15</xref> (see <xref href="IFRS17_gBC222-BC226.dita#IFRS17_gBC222_BC226/IFRS17_gBC222_BC226_TI" base="F59357914" id="IFRS17_X1452" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC222–BC224</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
