This option had been intended as a temporary solution, pending the publication of IFRS 17. However, although the terms of the option may appear to be imprecise, in the vast majority of cases the accounting choice for financial guarantee contracts is clear and no implementation problems appear to have been identified in practice. Therefore, the Board decided to carry forward to IFRS 17 the option to account for a financial guarantee contract as if it were an insurance contract, without any substantive changes, because the option has worked in practice and results in consistent accounting for economically similar contracts issued by the same entity. The Board did not view it as a high priority to address the inconsistency that results from accounting for financial guarantee contracts differently depending on the issuer.</p></body></paragraph>
