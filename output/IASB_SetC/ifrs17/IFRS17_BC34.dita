In doing this, the Board considered defining the investment component as (a) the amount that the contract requires to be repaid when no insured event occurs, rather than (b) the amount that would be repaid even if an insured event does not occur. For example, if the entity pays the higher of an account balance and a fixed amount in the event of a policyholder’s death, using the definition in (a) the whole of the payment that results from the policyholder’s death would be regarded as relating to the insurance component rather than to the investment component. Using the definition in (a) has the practical advantage that an entity would need to identify cash flows relating to an investment component only if it made a payment in the absence of an insured event. However, the Board decided that defining an investment component in this way does not faithfully represent the fact that the amount accumulated in the account balance through deposits by the policyholder is paid to the policyholder in all circumstances, including in the event of the policyholder’s death. In the Board’s view, the insurance benefit is the additional amount that the entity would be required to pay if an insured event occurs.</p></body></paragraph>
