The remeasurement of the contractual service margin reflects current rates and changes in the value of the consideration received. Remeasuring the contractual service margin in this way is consistent with the view that the entity is earning a variable fee from the contract—the amount it deducts from its obligation to return the value of underlying items to the policyholder (see <xref href="IFRS17_gBC238-BC269.dita#IFRS17_gBC238_BC269/IFRS17_gBC238_BC269_TI" id="IFRS17_X1720" base="F59389096" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC238–BC247</xref>). A consequence of this is that insurance revenue includes changes in the entity’s share in the change in the fair value of the underlying items. As set out in <xref href="IFRS17_B121.dita#IFRS17_B121" id="IFRS17_X1721" base="F59389097" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs B121–B124 of IFRS 17</xref>, insurance revenue includes the amount of contractual service margin allocated to the period for services provided in the period. The allocation of the contractual service margin amount is based on the remeasured contractual service margin. Insurance revenue for the period is therefore also based on that remeasured amount. The Board decided this appropriately reflects the variable nature of the fee for such contracts.</p></body></paragraph>
