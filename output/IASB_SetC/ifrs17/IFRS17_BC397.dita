New accounting mismatches could arise on first applying IFRS 17 if an entity were unable to reconsider the classification of financial assets that were classified at an earlier date in accordance with <xref href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_TOC.dita#IFRS09_TOC0001" base="F70528021" id="IFRS17_X1903" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 9</xref>. The Board concluded that entities should be able to designate financial assets using the fair value option on first applying IFRS 17 to the same extent that they would have been able to do so when first applying IFRS 9. In addition, the Board decided that, following earlier application of IFRS 9, an entity should be permitted to newly elect to use other comprehensive income to recognise changes in the fair value of some or all equity investments that are not held for trading, or to revoke such an election. The criterion for this classification option does not refer to accounting mismatches, so the Board decided that entities should be able to reconsider this election regardless of whether there is an effect on accounting mismatches when IFRS 17 is applied. Even though accounting mismatches do not determine the availability of this classification option, the Board noted that in practice entities may consider accounting mismatches when deciding whether to apply the option.</p></body></paragraph>
