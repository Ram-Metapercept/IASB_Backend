As a consequence of that amendment, the Board also amended the requirement in paragraph 62 of IFRS 17 (for recognising a group of reinsurance contracts held) to require an entity to recognise a group of reinsurance contracts held when the entity recognises onerous underlying insurance contracts, if it does so earlier than when the entity would otherwise recognise the group of reinsurance contracts held. The Board concluded such an amendment was necessary for income to be recognised on a group of reinsurance contracts held at the same time that losses are recognised on initial recognition of onerous underlying insurance contracts.</p></body></paragraph>
