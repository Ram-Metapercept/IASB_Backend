This notion had some intuitive appeal because it would include both amount and probability. However, such a definition would have meant that a contract could start as a financial liability and become an insurance contract as time passes or probabilities are reassessed. In the Board’s view, it would be too burdensome to require an entity to continuously monitor whether a contract meets the definition of an insurance contract over its duration. Instead, the Board adopted an approach that requires the decision about whether a contract is an insurance contract to be made once only, at contract inception (unless the terms of the contract are modified). The requirements in <xref href="IFRS17_B18.dita#IFRS17_B18" id="IFRS17_X1486" base="F59367582" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs B18–B24 of IFRS 17</xref> focus on whether insured events could cause an entity to pay additional amounts, judged on a contract-by-contract basis. Further, <xref href="IFRS17_B25.dita#IFRS17_B25" id="IFRS17_X1487" base="F59367583" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph B25 of IFRS 17</xref> states that an insurance contract remains an insurance contract until all rights and obligations expire.</p></body></paragraph>
