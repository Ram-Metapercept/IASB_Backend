When considering the principle from <xref href="../ifrs14/IFRS15_TOC.dita#IFRS15_TOC0001/IFRS15_TOC0001_V2" base="F59357760" id="IFRS17_X1421" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 15</xref>, the Board concluded that the obligation to provide coverage in any particular part of the entire coverage period would generally not be a separate performance obligation, and the coverage and services provided over the whole duration of the contract would generally be treated as a single performance obligation that is satisfied over time. Hence, a change in the pattern of expected cash flows results in the entity updating its measure of progress and adjusting the amount of revenue recognised accordingly. That approach is also consistent with the requirements in IFRS 17 to adjust the contractual service margin for changes in estimates of cash flows relating to future service (see <xref href="IFRS17_gBC222-BC226.dita#IFRS17_gBC222_BC226/IFRS17_gBC222_BC226_TI" base="F59357761" id="IFRS17_X1422" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC222–BC226</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
