The Board decided to permit an entity to choose         between the modified retrospective approach and the fair value approach if the entity cannot         apply IFRS 17 retrospectively. The Board acknowledged a choice of transition methods results         in a lack of comparability of transition amounts but concluded it was appropriate for the         following reasons. The objective of the modified retrospective approach is to achieve the         closest outcome to a retrospective application of the Standard. The Board noted that the         similarity between a modified retrospective approach and a full retrospective application         would depend on the amount of reasonable and supportable information available to an entity.         If an entity has relatively little reasonable and supportable information available, and,         therefore, would need to use many of the permitted modifications, the cost of the modified         retrospective approach might exceed the benefits.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
