However, the Board concluded that it would not be appropriate         to develop a bespoke solution for all hedging activities for insurance contracts, noting         that such a solution should form part of a broader project. The Board did not want to delay         the publication of IFRS 17 pending finalisation of that broader project. The Board also         concluded that a prospective basis was necessary for the application of the risk mitigation         requirements on transition, for the reasons set out in <xref href="IFRS17_gBC393-BC393.dita#IFRS17_gBC393_BC393/IFRS17_gBC393_BC393_TI" id="IFRS17_X1442" base="F59357864" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC393</xref>.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
