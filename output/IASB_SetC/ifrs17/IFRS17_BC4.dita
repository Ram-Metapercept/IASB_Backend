In particular, IFRS 4 included a ‘temporary exemption’ that explicitly stated that an entity need not ensure that its accounting policies are relevant to the economic decision-making needs of users of financial statements or that such accounting policies are reliable. As a result, there was wide diversity in the financial reporting of insurance contracts across entities applying IFRS Standards, and within some entities’ financial statements. In addition, some of that financial reporting did not provide useful information about those contracts to users of financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
