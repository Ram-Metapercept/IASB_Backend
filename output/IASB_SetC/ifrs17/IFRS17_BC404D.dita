The Board acknowledged that implementing IFRS 17 is a major undertaking. However, it noted that it had allowed an implementation period of three and a half years when it issued IFRS 17. Furthermore, given that IFRS 17 is urgently needed, the Board thought that a yearâ€™s deferral of the effective date as proposed in the 2019 Exposure Draft ought to be sufficient to allow for the effects of any disruption caused by amending the Standard before its effective date. The Board was careful to propose only targeted amendments and not to reopen fundamental aspects of the Standard. The Board acknowledged, however, that implementing the Standard by 2022, as proposed in the 2019 Exposure Draft, would be demanding, in particular for smaller insurers.</p></body></paragraph>
