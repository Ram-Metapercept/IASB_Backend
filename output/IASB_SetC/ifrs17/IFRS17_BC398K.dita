Therefore, entities that choose to       apply the classification overlay to some or all of their financial assets are still required       to apply the requirements of IFRS 9 to financial assets that continue to be recognised at the       date of initial application of IFRS 9. This means that at the date of initial application of       IFRS 9, entities that apply the classification overlay will be required to assess whether the       classification of financial assets that continue to be recognised at that date is in       accordance with IFRS 9. If the classification determined applying the classification overlay       does not meet the requirements of IFRS 9 on the date of initial application of IFRS 9, the       entity would be required to update the classification of a financial asset on that date and       apply the updated classification retrospectively (see<xref href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_7.2.3.dita" class="- topic/xref ">         paragraph 7.2.3 of IFRS 9</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
