The Board had proposed requiring insurance finance income or expenses to be disaggregated between profit or loss and other comprehensive income. However, the Board was persuaded that the balance between the costs and benefits of such disaggregation will vary significantly across entities depending on the type of insurance contracts that they issue and the information that the users of their financial statements find most useful. The Board therefore concluded that it should leave the assessment of that balance to be made by the entity.</p></body></paragraph>
