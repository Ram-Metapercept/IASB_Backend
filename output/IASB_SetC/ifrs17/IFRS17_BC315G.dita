On balance, the Board concluded that       the added complexity is justified given the strong stakeholder support for the information       that will result from entities applying the amendment. The Board also noted that, applying the       amendment, the loss-recovery component of a reinsurance contract held is treated similarly to       the loss component of insurance contracts issued. That similarity will help entities to       understand how to apply the amendment, reducing the complexity caused.</p></body></paragraph>
