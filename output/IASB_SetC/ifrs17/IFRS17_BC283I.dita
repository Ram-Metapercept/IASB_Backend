The Board acknowledged that an entity may also incur investment activity costs to enhance benefits from insurance coverage for policyholders. Therefore, the Board amended IFRS 17 to specify that an entity is required to include investment activity costs in the fulfilment cash flows to the extent that the entity performs those activities to enhance benefits from insurance coverage for policyholders. The Board also specified when investment activities enhance benefits from insurance coverage. The Board noted that in determining whether investment activity costs enhance benefits from insurance coverage for policyholders, an entity needs to apply judgement in a similar manner to when an entity determines whether an investment-return service exists.</p></body></paragraph>
