For these entities, the classification overlay relates only to the application of <xref href="IFRS17_C29.dita" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph C29 of IFRS 17</xref> and can be applied only to           financial assets derecognised in the comparative period. Initially, the Board had proposed           that the classification overlay could be applied only by the entities described in (a) and           (b). However, stakeholders informed the Board that similar, albeit less significant,           accounting mismatches could arise for entities that applied IFRS 9 before they first apply           IFRS 17. Such mismatches could arise because these entities cannot apply paragraph C29 of           IFRS 17 to financial assets derecognised in the comparative period. Therefore, the Board           decided to make the classification overlay available to these entities, but only for           financial assets derecognised in the comparative period.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
