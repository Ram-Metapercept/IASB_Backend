The essence of the mirroring approach was that, to the extent that an entity expects to settle fulfilment cash flows payable to policyholders with assets or other underlying items it holds, the entity would measure those fulfilment cash flows just as it measures the underlying items. Similarly, an entity would recognise changes in fulfilment cash flows subject to the mirroring approach (those that are expected to vary directly with returns on underlying items) in profit or loss or other comprehensive income on the same basis as the recognition of changes in the value of the underlying items. All other cash flows would be measured using the general requirements.</p></body></paragraph>
