The Board considered but rejected a suggestion to also amend the annual cohort requirement in paragraph 22 of IFRS 17 to base it on the date contracts are recognised, instead of the date they are issued. The objective of the annual cohort requirement is to facilitate timely recognition of profits, losses and trends in profitability. The profitability of a contract is initially set when the contract is issued, based on facts and circumstances at that dateâ€”for example, interest rates, underwriting expectations and pricing. Hence, the Board concluded that determining annual cohorts based on the date that contracts are issued is necessary to provide useful information about trends in profitability.</p></body></paragraph>
