These stakeholders were uncertain whether such an alignment would occur if the Board confirmed a one-year deferral. They commented on uncertainties and delays in jurisdictional endorsement and adoption processes and the consequential uncertainty about the effective dates that might be set in some jurisdictions. The Board noted that it had set the effective date of IFRS 17 so that jurisdictions would have sufficient time to adopt the new Standard. However, the Board acknowledged that considering amendments to the Standard before its effective date inevitably caused some disruption to those processes. The Board noted that the initial application of IFRS 17 will significantly affect insurersâ€™ financial statements and acknowledged that users of financial statements would benefit if the initial application of IFRS 17 were aligned around the world.</p></body></paragraph>
