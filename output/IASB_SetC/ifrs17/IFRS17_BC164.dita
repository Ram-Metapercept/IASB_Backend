For example, in one reporting period an entity may decide that a renewal premium for a portfolio of contracts is outside the contract boundary because the restriction on the entity’s ability to reprice the contract has no commercial substance. However, if circumstances change so that the same restrictions on the entity’s ability to reprice the portfolio take on commercial substance, the entity may conclude that future renewal premiums for that portfolio of contracts are within the boundary of the contract.</p></body></paragraph>
