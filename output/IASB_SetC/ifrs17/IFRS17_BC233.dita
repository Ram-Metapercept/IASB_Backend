The Board decided that for the liability for remaining coverage, in general, it was reasonable to assume that experience adjustments relate to current or past service. In contrast, changes in estimates of future cash flows in general can be assumed to relate to future service. The Board noted that experience adjustments relating to premiums received for future coverage relate to future service and are an exception to this general rule.</p></body></paragraph>
