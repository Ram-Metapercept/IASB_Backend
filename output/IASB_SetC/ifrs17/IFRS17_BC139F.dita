Such an exemption could result in a portfolio consisting of only the three groups of contracts described in paragraph BC127, that would each last for the entire life of the portfolio, which may be indefinite. The contractual service margin of each group would average the profitability of all contracts in the group over the life of the portfolio, resulting in the loss of useful information about trends in profitability. The contracts placed in any of the three profitability groups could be significantly more or less profitable than other contracts in the group. The effect of averaging profits of the contracts in the group could therefore be substantially increased, leading to a greater likelihood that:</p><ol outputclass="static" class="- topic/ol "><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(a)</li_value><p class="- topic/p ">the contractual service margin of a contract would outlast the coverage period of that contract; and</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(b)</li_value><p class="- topic/p ">the continuing profitability of some contracts would absorb the subsequent adverse changes in expectations that make some contracts onerous.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
