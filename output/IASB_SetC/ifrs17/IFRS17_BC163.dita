Even when an entity is prevented from         repricing an existing contract using an individual policyholder’s risk assessment,         the entity may nonetheless be able to reprice a portfolio to which the contract belongs with         the result that the price charged for the portfolio as a whole fully reflects the risk of         the portfolio. As a result, these stakeholders argued that in such cases the entity is no         longer bound by the existing portfolio of contracts and that any cash flows that arise         beyond that repricing point should be considered to be beyond the boundary of the existing         contract. To the extent that an entity would not be able to charge a price that fully         reflects the risks of the portfolio as a whole, it would be bound by the existing contract.         The Board was persuaded by this view and modified the contract boundary so that such cash         flows are considered to be outside the contract boundary, provided the pricing of the         premiums for coverage up to the date when the risks are reassessed does not take into         account the risks that relate to periods subsequent to the reassessment date.<xref type="fn" keyref="footnotes/IFRS17_BC160_BC162_BC163_FN0001" class="- topic/xref "/></p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
