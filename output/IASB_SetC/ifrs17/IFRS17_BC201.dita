The objective of the discount rate is to adjust estimated future cash flows for the time value of money and for financial risks (for example, the liquidity risk), to the extent that they are not included in the estimated cash flows, in a way that captures the characteristics of the contract.

Such factors include risks that are not present in the contracts but are present in the financial instrument for which the market prices are observed. Thus, the discount rate should not capture all of the characteristics of those assets, even if the entity views those assets as backing those contracts.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
