That amendment extends the period for which an asset for insurance acquisition cash flows exists, and therefore increases the total amount of such assets at the end of each reporting period. In the light of the amendment, the Board amended the disclosure requirements in IFRS 17 to require an entity to disclose a reconciliation from the opening to the closing balance of any asset for insurance acquisition cash flows recognised applying paragraph 28B of IFRS 17. An entity is also required to provide quantitative disclosure, in appropriate time bands, of the expected inclusion of insurance acquisition cash flows recognised as an asset in the measurement of the group of insurance contracts to which they are allocated (see paragraph 105A of IFRS 17).</p></body></paragraph>
