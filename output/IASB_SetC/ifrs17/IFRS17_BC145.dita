As discussed in <xref href="IFRS17_gBC176-BC180.dita#IFRS17_gBC176_BC180/IFRS17_gBC176_BC180_TI" id="IFRS17_X1579" base="F59369258" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph           BC176</xref>, the Board concluded that an entity should not recognise such costs as         separate assets. Instead, IFRS 17 requires such costs to be recognised as part of the cash         flows of the group of insurance contracts once it qualifies for initial recognition. The         Board observed that, in effect, entities will recognise groups from the date that the         insurance acquisition cash flows are incurred. However, although an asset or liability is         recognised from that date, entities do not need to update assumptions until the date the         group qualifies for initial recognition and they are required only to determine the         contractual service margin at that later date.<xref type="fn" keyref="footnotes/IFRS17_BC145_FN0001" class="- topic/xref "/></p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
