Some aspects of the adjustments to the carrying amount of the contractual service margin result in gains being treated differently from losses or changes in estimates relating to current and past service being treated differently from changes in estimates relating to future service (see <xref href="IFRS17_gBC21-BC21.dita#IFRS17_gBC21_BC21/IFRS17_gBC21_BC21_TI" id="IFRS17_X1555" base="F59369114" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC21–BC24</xref>). These different treatments mean that the accounting result depends on the level of aggregation at which the adjustments are made, because amounts that would offset each other within the measurement of a group of insurance contracts would be treated differently (and hence not offset each other) if contracts were measured individually.</p></body></paragraph>
