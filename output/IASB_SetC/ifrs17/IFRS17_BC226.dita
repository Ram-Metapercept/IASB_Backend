Those with this view argued that it would be inconsistent to prohibit the recognition of gains on initial recognition, but then to require the subsequent recognition of gains on the basis of changes in estimates made immediately after initial recognition. The Board, persuaded by these views, accordingly decided to adjust the contractual service margin for changes in estimates of fulfilment cash flows that relate to future service.</p></body></paragraph>
