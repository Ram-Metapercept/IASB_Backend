However, the liability for remaining coverage represents the obligation to provide coverage for a future period and other services needed to fulfil the contract. As a result, recognising insurance revenue to the extent of a reduction in the liability for remaining coverage, adjusted to eliminate changes that do not relate to the satisfaction of the performance obligation, would faithfully represent the entity’s performance in providing services. The adjustments to the liability for remaining coverage exclude from total insurance revenue the part of the change in the liability for remaining coverage that does not relate to cash flows expected to generate revenue; for example, insurance finance income or expenses, and losses on groups of onerous contracts. These adjustments ensure that the total insurance revenue presented over the duration of the group of insurance contracts is the same as the premiums received for services, adjusted for a financing component.</p></body></paragraph>
