Some stakeholders argued that estimating the timing of payments and calculating a discount rate would introduce additional subjectivity into the measurement of insurance contracts and that this could reduce comparability and permit earnings management. Furthermore, these stakeholders stated that the benefits of presenting a discounted measure of non-life insurance contracts might not justify the costs of preparing that measure. These stakeholders stated that the timing of cash flows and the resulting interest is an essential component of the pricing and profitability of life insurance contracts, but is less relevant for non-life insurance contracts for which the stakeholders viewed underwriting results as the most critical component of pricing and profitability.</p></body></paragraph>
