The Board observed that some entities may not       be prepared to apply the impairment requirements in <xref href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_TOC.dita" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 9</xref> for the comparative period presented on initial application of IFRS 9. In the       Boardâ€™s view, these entities should be allowed to apply the classification overlay because,       even without the application of the IFRS 9 impairment requirements, the classification overlay       would result in useful information to the users of the financial statements. Consequently, the       Board concluded that, if based on the classification determined applying <xref href="IFRS17_C28B.dita" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph C28B</xref> the financial asset would be subject to the       impairment requirements of IFRS 9 but the entity does not apply those requirements in applying       the classification overlay, the entity continues to present any amount recognised in respect       of impairment in the prior period in accordance with <xref href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita" class="- topic/xref ">IAS         39</xref>. Otherwise, any impairment amount previously recognised for that financial asset       is reversed.</p></body></paragraph>
