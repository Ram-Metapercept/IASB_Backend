The Board considered whether to give an exemption from dividing contracts into separate groups if the only reason that they would fall into different groups specified in <xref href="IFRS17_BC127.dita#IFRS17_BC127" id="IFRS17_X1566" base="F59369153" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC127</xref> is because of such constraints. In general, the Board seeks to minimise exemptions because they increase complexity for both users of financial statements and preparers and may have unintended consequences for future standard-setting activities. Further, providing an exemption for accounting for economic differences caused by the effect of law or regulation on pricing may create an undesirable precedent, given that such effects are not restricted to insurance contracts. However, the notion of grouping contracts to determine the profit or losses recognised is a specific feature of the requirements in IFRS 17. In deciding the appropriate grouping of contracts, the Board sought to balance the need to group contracts to reflect the economics of issuing insurance contracts against grouping at too high a level, which would reduce the usefulness of information produced (see <xref href="IFRS17_BC123.dita#IFRS17_BC123" id="IFRS17_X1567" base="F59369194" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC123</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
