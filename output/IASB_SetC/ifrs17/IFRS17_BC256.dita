This approach would have allowed an entity to recognise in profit or loss the change in fair value of a hypothetical derivative that matches the critical terms of the specified fulfilment cash flows or the entity’s share of the fair value return on the underlying items. This might have resulted in a greater reduction in accounting mismatches, because a fair value measurement would have been used in profit or loss for both the ‘hedged’ fulfilment cash flows and the ‘hedging’ derivative, relative to the measurement being used for the fulfilment cash flows under IFRS 17. However, the Board concluded that such an approach would involve too much additional complexity.</p></body></paragraph>
