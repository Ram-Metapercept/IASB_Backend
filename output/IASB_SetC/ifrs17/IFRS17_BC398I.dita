Such a boundary would have enabled entities to reduce accounting mismatches between insurance       contract liabilities and related financial assets and therefore would have addressed the key       concern raised by stakeholders. However, respondents to the exposure draft informed the Board       that permitting an entity that first applies IFRS 17 and <xref href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_TOC.dita" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 9</xref> at the same time to apply the classification       overlay to financial assets held in respect of non-insurance activities could improve the       usefulness of comparative information presented on initial application. These respondents       explained that because such entities qualified for the temporary exemption from applying IFRS       9 (see <xref href="../ifrs04/IFRS04_20G.dita" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 20G of IFRS 4</xref>), the proportion       of financial assets they hold in respect of non-insurance activities is not significant.       Nevertheless, the ability to apply the classification overlay to all financial assets would       significantly reduce operational complexity for those entities and would result in more       financial assets being presented in a manner consistent with IFRS 9. The Board therefore       concluded that the benefits of expanding the availability of the classification overlay would       outweigh any perceived costs.</p></body></paragraph>
