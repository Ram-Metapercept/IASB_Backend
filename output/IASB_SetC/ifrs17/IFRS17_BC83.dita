Sometimes investment contracts with discretionary participation features share in the performance of insurance contracts. Using the same accounting for both types of contracts will produce more useful information for users of financial statements because it enhances comparability within an entity. It also simplifies the accounting for those contracts. For example, some cash flow distributions to participating policyholders are made in aggregate both for insurance contracts that specify a link to returns on underlying items and for investment contracts with discretionary participation features. This makes it challenging to apply different accounting models to different parts of that aggregate participation.</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS17_P5947" base="F55751277" class="- topic/p ">both of these types of contract often have characteristics, such as long maturities, recurring premiums and high acquisition cash flows that are more commonly found in insurance contracts than in most other financial instruments.

Splitting these contracts into components with different accounting treatments would cause the same problems that would arise if insurance contracts were separated (see <xref href="IFRS17_BC10.dita#IFRS17_BC10" id="IFRS17_X1492" base="F59367628" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC10(a)</xref>). Also, in the Board’s view, the accounting model it has developed for insurance contracts, including the treatment of discretionary cash flows (see <xref href="IFRS17_gBC167-BC170.dita#IFRS17_gBC167_BC170/IFRS17_gBC167_BC170_TI" id="IFRS17_X1493" base="F59367629" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC167–BC170</xref>), is more appropriate than using any other model for these types of contracts.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
