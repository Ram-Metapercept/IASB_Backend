Measuring a group of insurance contracts using undiscounted cash flows would fail to represent faithfully the entity’s financial position and would be less relevant to users of financial statements than a measurement that includes the discounted amounts. The Board also concluded that discount rates and the amount and timing of future cash flows can generally be estimated without excessive measurement uncertainty at a reasonable cost. Absolute precision is unattainable, but it is also unnecessary. The Board is of the view that the measurement uncertainty caused by discounting does not outweigh the additional relevance of the resulting measurement of the entity’s obligations. Furthermore, many entities have experience in discounting, both to support investment decisions and to measure items for which other IFRS Standards require discounting, such as financial instruments, employee benefit obligations and long-term non-financial liabilities. Additionally, the Board has learned that, for internal managerial purposes, some insurance entities discount some of their non-life insurance portfolios or groups of insurance contracts.</p></body></paragraph>
