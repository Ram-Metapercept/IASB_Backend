However, the contractual service margin is adjusted only to the extent that it does not become negative. Beyond that, the changes in assumptions cause a gain or loss to be recognised in the statement(s) of financial performance.

The Board concluded that the former provided information that was consistent with the treatment of such changes as being part of the variable fee for service.</p></body></paragraph>
