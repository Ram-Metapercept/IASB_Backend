The approach in IFRS 17 to the measurement of a group of insurance contracts is to estimate the profit expected to be generated over the duration of the group. In this context, excluding some insurance acquisition cash flows that relate to issuing a portfolio of contracts would result in an understatement of the fulfilment cash flows and an overstatement of the contractual service margins of groups in the portfolio. In addition, the Board wanted to avoid measuring liabilities and expenses at different amounts depending on how an entity structures its insurance acquisition activities, as described in <xref href="IFRS17_BC182.dita#IFRS17_BC182" id="IFRS17_X1632" base="F59369511" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC182(a)</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
