In the Board’s view, applying the requirements in IFRS 17 provides more relevant information about such contracts than would be provided by applying other Standards. The Board also noted that investment contracts with discretionary participation features are almost exclusively issued by entities that issue insurance contracts (see <xref href="IFRS17_gBC82-BC86.dita#IFRS17_gBC82_BC86/IFRS17_gBC82_BC86_TI" id="IFRS17_X1456" base="F59357918" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC82–BC86</xref>).</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS17_P5912" base="F55751211" class="- topic/p ">it applies to financial guarantee contracts provided they meet the definition of insurance contracts in IFRS 17, the entity has previously asserted that it regards such contracts as insurance contracts and the entity has used accounting that is applicable to insurance contracts for such financial guarantee contracts. The Board noted that it has previously heard incompatible views on the appropriate accounting model for financial guarantee contracts and does not view work in this area as a high priority (see <xref href="IFRS17_gBC91-BC94.dita#IFRS17_gBC91_BC94/IFRS17_gBC91_BC94_TI" id="IFRS17_X1457" base="F59357959" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC91–BC94</xref>).</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS17_P5913" base="F55751213" class="- topic/p ">it amends other IFRS Standards (see <xref href="IFRS17_APPD.dita#IFRS17_APPD/IFRS17_APPD_TI" id="IFRS17_X1458" base="F59357960" class="- topic/xref ">Appendix D of IFRS 17</xref>) to permit an entity to recognise its own shares as assets and to measure such assets, own debt and owner-occupied property at fair value when held in an investment fund that provides investors with benefits determined by units in the fund or when an entity holds the investment as an underlying item for insurance contracts with direct participation features. The Board decided that for many contracts that specify a link to returns on underlying items, those underlying items include a mix of assets that are almost all measured at fair value through profit or loss. Measurement of own shares, own debt and owner-occupied property at fair value through profit or loss would be consistent with the measurement of the majority of the underlying assets and would prevent accounting mismatches.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
