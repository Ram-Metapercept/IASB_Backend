IFRS 17 does not treat such contracts as insurance contracts even though the contracts are traditionally described as insurance contracts and may be subject to regulation by insurance supervisors. Similarly, some contracts may contain significant insurance risk and therefore may meet the definition of insurance contracts in IFRS 17, even though they do not have the legal form of insurance contracts. Thus, IFRS 17 adopts a definition of an insurance contract that reflects the contract’s economic substance and not merely its legal form.</p></body></paragraph>
