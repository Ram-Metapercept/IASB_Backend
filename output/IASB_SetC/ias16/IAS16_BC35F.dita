However, the Board noted that the proposed amendment would improve financial statement presentation before those projects could be completed and decided to add <xref href="IAS16_68A.dita#IAS16_68A" base="F15999323" id="IAS16_X0442" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 68A</xref> as previously exposed. A few respondents raised the concern that the term ‘held for sale’ in the amendment could be confused with the notion of held for sale in accordance with <xref href="../ifrs05/IFRS05_TOC.dita#IFRS05_TOC0001" base="F15999422" id="IAS16_X0443" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 5 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Non‑current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations</ph></ph></xref>.
