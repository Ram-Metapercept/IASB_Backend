However, the respondents argued, and the Board agreed, that the modified second principle was not clearer because it would result in an entity recognising in the carrying amount of an asset and then depreciating subsequent expenditures that were for the day‑to‑day servicing of items of property, plant and equipment, those that might commonly be regarded as for ‘repairs and maintenance’. That result was not the Board’s intention.</p></body></paragraph>
