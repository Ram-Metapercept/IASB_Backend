However, the Board noted that most of the investors and analysts consulted during the user outreach performed by the staff said that fair value information about bearer plants has limited use to them without fair value information about the related land, agricultural machinery, etc. Furthermore, virtually all respondents to the ED said that disclosure of fair value information about bearer plants and/or information about the significant inputs used in valuation techniques should not be required.</p></body></paragraph>
