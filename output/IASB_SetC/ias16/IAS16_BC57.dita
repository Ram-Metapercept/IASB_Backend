However, the Board noted that it had only received limited information about these issues within the context of other biological assets. The Board agreed that the scope of the project should not be expanded without understanding whether IAS 16 is appropriate and can be applied consistently to those biological assets. The Board observed that obtaining this understanding would take time and delay completion of the ED. The Board also noted that such requests for an expanded scope would increase the complexity of the project and raise conceptual issues that did not belong in a limited-scope project but instead in a comprehensive review of <xref href="../ias41/IAS41_TOC.dita#IAS41_TOC0001/IAS41_TOC0001_V2" base="F35269920" id="IAS16_X0483" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 41</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
