The Board also noted that plantation companies generally provide more information about productivity of bearer plants outside the financial statements than is required by paragraph 46 of IAS 41 and would be likely to continue to disclose their chosen non-financial measures of bearer plants even if this paragraph only refers to produce.</p></li></ol><p id="IAS16_P0533" base="SL32831068" class="- topic/p ">Consequently, the Board decided not to add the disclosures in paragraph 46 of IAS 41 to IAS 16.</p></body></paragraph>
