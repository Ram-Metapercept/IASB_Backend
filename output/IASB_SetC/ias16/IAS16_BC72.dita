By analogy, biological transformation should not be included either. The Board further noted that most of the investors and analysts consulted during the outreach performed by the staff said that the <xref href="../ias41/IAS41_TOC.dita#IAS41_TOC0001/IAS41_TOC0001_V2" base="F35269960" id="IAS16_X0496" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 41</xref> fair value information about bearer plants is of limited use to them and that the measurement of the fair values of bearer plants is particularly subjective during the early years of the life cycle of those bearer plants. For these reasons the Board decided that bearer plants should be measured at accumulated cost before they reach maturity. The Board also observed that it would be simpler to keep bearer plants in IAS 16 throughout their life. Virtually all respondents to the ED supported measuring bearer plants using a cost accumulation approach before they mature.</p></body></paragraph>
