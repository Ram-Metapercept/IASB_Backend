It also had significant support among national standard-setters and other interested parties. Furthermore, on the basis of feedback from the 2011 Agenda Consultation and other outreach, the expected changes under the project would be likely to reduce compliance costs for preparers and would not adversely affect users of financial statements.</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(b)</li_value> <p id="IAS16_P0459" base="SL32830944" class="- topic/p ">it had the advantage of timeliness compared to a more comprehensive project. The Board was able to use the research performed by the MASB and address the main issues relatively quickly. A more comprehensive project would have had to wait for space on the Board’s agenda and, once started, might have taken several years.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
