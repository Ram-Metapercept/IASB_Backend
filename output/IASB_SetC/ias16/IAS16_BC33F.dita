In response to the comments received about the proposed guidance the IASB decided to change the focus of this guidance. The IASB decided to explain that expected future reductions in the selling price of an item could indicate the expectation of technical or commercial obsolescence of the asset, which, in turn, might reflect a reduction of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset. The IASB noted that the expectation of technical or commercial obsolescence is relevant for estimating both the pattern of consumption of future economic benefits and the useful life of an asset. The IASB noted that the diminishing balance method is an accepted depreciation methodology in <xref href="IAS16_62.dita#IAS16_62" id="IAS16_X0427" base="F34942840" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 62 of IAS 16</xref>, which is capable of reflecting an accelerated consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset.</p>  </variant></body></paragraph>
