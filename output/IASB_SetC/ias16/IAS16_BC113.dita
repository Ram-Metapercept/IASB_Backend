Many of these investors and analysts told the staff that they focus on cash flows that an entity is expected to realise. These investors and analysts said that the fair value of bearer plants is not considered in their analysis because the bearer plants themselves are not sold and the changes in the fair value of the bearer plants do not directly influence the entity’s future cash flows. Furthermore, some of these investors and analysts said that they would prefer a cost model for bearer plants because it provides a better basis to forecast future capital expenditure than a fair value model.</p></body></paragraph>
