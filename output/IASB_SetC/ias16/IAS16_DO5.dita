Mr Finnegan and Ms McConnell continue to believe that fair value measurement for the biological transformation process provides the best information about bearer assets’ quality and quantitative changes during their growth period. They also believe that the fair value of bearer plants at maturity provides the best measure of an entity’s resources being placed into the production of produce at maturity. Investors need that information to assess management’s stewardship of the resources invested in the production process and the performance of the entity using those resources. Consequently, they believe that bearer plants must be measured at fair value while maturing because fair value provides users of financial statements with the best information about an important aspect of an agricultural entity’s performance and management stewardship.</p></body></paragraph>
