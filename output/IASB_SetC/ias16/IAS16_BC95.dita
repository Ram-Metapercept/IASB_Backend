If bearer plants have long life cycles, entities could be required to look back several decades in order to obtain the necessary information. Consequently, for cost-benefit reasons, the Board decided that the amendments to IAS 16 should permit the use of fair value as deemed cost for items of bearer plants at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The Board also noted that the amendments address an immediate need for entities with bearer plants. Consequently, the Board decided that the amendments should be available for early application.</p></body></paragraph>
