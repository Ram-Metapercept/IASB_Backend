For example, the restriction would not apply to tangible goods that include a significant amount of intellectual property and, instead, any variable consideration to which the entity is entitled in exchange for those tangible goods would be considered under the general requirements for constraining estimates of variable consideration. Some respondents questioned the conceptual rationale for including a restriction that could in some cases result in an outcome that was not consistent with the requirement to recognise some or all of an estimate of variable consideration. Others asked whether they could apply the restriction by analogy if the promised good or service had characteristics similar to a licence of intellectual property and the consideration depended on the customer’s future actions. Consequently, the boards considered whether they should do either of the following:</p><ol outputclass="static" id="IFRS15_L0224" base="F31840336" type="lower-alpha" class="- topic/ol "><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2813" base="F31840337" class="- topic/p ">expand the scope of <xref href="IFRS15_gB63-B63B.dita#IFRS15_gB63_B63B" id="IFRS15_X2203" base="F35619969" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph B63 of IFRS 15</xref> to constrain all estimates of variable consideration when that consideration depends on the customer’s future actions; or</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2814" base="F31840339" class="- topic/p ">develop a general principle that could be applied to all contracts that would achieve broadly the same outcomes.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
