In other words, the boards did not expect that an entity would need to prepare a quantitative analysis each time it assessed the likelihood of whether a significant revenue reversal could occur. Therefore, the boards concluded that including a confidence level would not result in application of the requirements that is too costly or complex.</p></body></paragraph>
