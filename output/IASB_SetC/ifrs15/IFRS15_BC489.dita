Those costs may include costs to modify their processes and analyses. However, the costs are likely to be non-recurring and are likely to be offset by a longer-term reduction in costs from the additional information that would be provided by the improved disclosure requirements. Users of financial statements may also observe a longer-term reduction in education costs, because of the common framework created by IFRS 15, which applies across jurisdictions, industries and transactions.</p></body></paragraph>
