Some respondents noted that this would not always faithfully depict the amount of consideration to which an entity is entitled for satisfying a particular performance obligation. For example, those respondents noted that the allocation of the discount could result in a loss on one part of the contract although the contract as a whole may be profitable (for example, the contract contains both a high-margin item and a low-margin item). They suggested that the boards should permit an entity to allocate the discount in a contract using one of the following alternatives:</p><ol outputclass="static" id="IFRS15_L0195" base="F31839892" type="lower-alpha" class="- topic/ol "><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2535" base="F31839893" class="- topic/p ">a management approach, in which an entity would assess which promised good or service is priced at a discount to its stand-alone selling price.</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2536" base="F31839895" class="- topic/p ">a residual approach, in which any discount in the contract would be allocated entirely to the satisfied performance obligations.</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2537" base="F31839897" class="- topic/p ">a profit margin approach, in which an entity would allocate the discount in a contract in proportion to the individual profit margin on each performance obligation.
