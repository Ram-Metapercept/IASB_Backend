One of the reasons that the IASB decided not to introduce an exemption for perfunctory or inconsequential performance obligations is that it was not considered necessary, both because of how the concept of ‘distinct’ is applied and also because of the application of materiality. In assessing promised goods or services and identifying performance obligations, entities should consider not only materiality considerations but also the overall objective of IFRS 15. The IASB further noted that materiality is an overarching concept that applies throughout IFRS and not just when it is mentioned explicitly.</p></body></paragraph>
