The boards considered whether to allow an accounting policy election for contract costs, under which an entity would have been able to choose to recognise an asset from the acquisition costs or recognise those costs as an expense (with disclosure of the accounting policy election). The boards noted that this would have been consistent with previous revenue recognition requirements in US GAAP for public entities. However, the boards noted that introducing accounting policy elections into IFRS 15 would have reduced comparability and therefore would not have met one of the key objectives of the Revenue Recognition project to improve comparability in accounting among entities and industries. Consequently, the boards decided not to allow entities an accounting policy election with respect to contract acquisition costs.</p></body></paragraph>
