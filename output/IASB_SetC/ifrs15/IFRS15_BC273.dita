This is because in IFRS 15 the residual approach is used to determine the stand-alone selling price of a distinct good or service. By definition, the outcome of this approach cannot realistically result in a stand-alone selling price of zero if the good or service is in fact distinct because to be distinct that good or service must have value on a stand-alone basis. In contrast, the residual method in previous revenue Standards could have resulted in an outcome of zero because the residual method was an allocation method. Thus, under previous revenue recognition requirements, zero could be the only amount of consideration that remained to be allocated to a performance obligation. Consequently, the boards noted that if the residual approach in <xref href="IFRS15_79.dita#IFRS15_79" id="IFRS15_X2009" base="F35619559" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 79(c) of IFRS 15</xref> results in no, or very little, consideration being allocated to a good or service or a bundle of goods or services, the entity should consider whether that estimate is appropriate in those circumstances.</p></body></paragraph>
