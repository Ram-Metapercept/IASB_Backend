Those respondents explained that for customer options, breakage is taken into account when determining the stand-alone selling price of the option as required by <xref href="IFRS15_B42.dita#IFRS15_B42" id="IFRS15_X2151" base="F35619888" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph B42 of IFRS 15</xref>. Therefore, those respondents were concerned that when the consideration is allocated between the option and another performance obligation, some of the breakage on the option would be recognised when the other performance obligation is satisfied, which could occur before any rights under the options are exercised by the customer. However, the boards observed that when there are two (or more) performance obligations, IFRS 15 requires an entity to allocate the overall consideration between the performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices and, therefore, any discount on the combined bundle of goods or services is allocated on that basis (unless the entity meets the requirements in <xref href="IFRS15_82.dita#IFRS15_82" id="IFRS15_X2152" base="F35619889" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 82</xref> or <xref href="IFRS15_85.dita#IFRS15_85" id="IFRS15_X2153" base="F35619920" class="- topic/xref ">85 of IFRS 15</xref> to allocate on another basis). In other words, any difference between the sum of the stand-alone selling prices of the option and the other promised goods or services compared with the overall consideration would be recognised when (or as) the entity transfers the goods or services promised in the contract, which is consistent with the pattern of revenue recognition for breakage when there is only one performance obligation.</p></body></paragraph>
