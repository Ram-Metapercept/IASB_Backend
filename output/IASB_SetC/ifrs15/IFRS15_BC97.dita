Specifically, the good or service must be capable of being distinct—that is, the good or service is capable of providing a benefit to the customer either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The boards were concerned that requiring an entity to account separately (and estimate a stand-alone selling price) for a good or service that is not capable of providing a benefit to the customer might result in information that would not be relevant to users of financial statements. For example, if an entity transferred a machine to the customer, but the machine is only capable of providing a benefit to the customer after an installation process that only the entity can provide, the machine would not be distinct.</p></body></paragraph>
