Nearly 1,000 comment letters were received from respondents representing a wide range of industries, including construction, manufacturing, telecommunications, technology, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, financial services, consulting, media and entertainment, energy and utilities, freight and logistics, and industries with significant franchising operations, such as hospitality and quick‑service restaurant chains. The boards and their staffs also consulted extensively on the proposals in the 2010 Exposure Draft by participating in round-table discussions, conferences, working group sessions, discussion forums and one-to-one discussions that were held across all major geographical regions.</p></body></paragraph>
