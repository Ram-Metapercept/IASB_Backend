However, the boards decided not to introduce this principle into IFRS 15. This is because it would have prevented an entity from recognising any revenue when the goods and services were transferred in cases in which the entity could estimate the variable consideration and meet the objective of constraining estimates of variable consideration.</p></body></paragraph>
