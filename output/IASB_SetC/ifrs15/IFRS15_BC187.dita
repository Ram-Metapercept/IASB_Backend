For example, in the healthcare industry, an entity may determine the transaction price based on amounts to which it will be entitled to payment from the patient, insurance companies and/or governmental organisations. This may also occur in other industries in which an entity receives a payment from a manufacturer as a result of the manufacturer issuing coupons or rebates directly to the entity’s customer. However, it would not include amounts collected on behalf of another party such as some sales taxes and value added taxes in some jurisdictions.</p></body></paragraph>
