The boards made this clarification to ensure that an entity can, in some cases, attribute the reassessment of variable consideration to only the satisfied portion of a performance obligation when that performance obligation meets the criterion in <xref href="IFRS15_22.dita#IFRS15_22" id="IFRS15_X2020" base="F35619601" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 22(b) of IFRS 15</xref>. Consider the example of a contract to provide hotel management services for one year (ie a single performance obligation in accordance with <xref href="IFRS15_22.dita#IFRS15_22" id="IFRS15_X2021" base="F35619602" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 22(b) of IFRS 15</xref>) in which the consideration is variable and determined based on two per cent of occupancy rates. The entity provides a daily service of management that is distinct and the uncertainty related to the consideration is also resolved on a daily basis when the occupancy occurs. In those circumstances, the boards did not intend for an entity to allocate the variable consideration determined on a daily basis to the entire performance obligation (ie the promise to provide management services over a one-year period). Instead, the variable consideration should be allocated to the distinct service to which the variable consideration relates, which is the daily management service.</p></body></paragraph>
