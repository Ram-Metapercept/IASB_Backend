The IASB also noted that an entity’s decision to stop pursuing collection would not typically affect the entity’s rights and the customer’s obligations under the contract with respect to the consideration owed by the customer. On this basis, the IASB concluded that the existing requirements in IFRS 15 are sufficient for an entity to conclude, without any additional clarification, that a contract is terminated when it stops providing goods or services to the customer. Some IASB members also expressed concerns about the potential for unintended consequences relating to other areas of IFRS if contract termination were to be defined in IFRS 15. Consequently, the IASB decided not to amend <xref href="IFRS15_15.dita#IFRS15_15" id="IFRS15_X1777" base="F51967232" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 15</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
