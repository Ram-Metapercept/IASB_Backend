This is because the term ‘time value of money’ is a broader economic term that may suggest that it is necessary to adjust the promised amount of consideration in circumstances other than when the cash sales price may differ from the contractual payments. In addition, the boards decided to refine the factors in <xref href="IFRS15_61.dita#IFRS15_61" id="IFRS15_X1977" base="F35619444" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 61 of IFRS 15</xref> that an entity should consider when deciding whether a contract includes a significant financing component.

This factor is presented as an indicator because in some cases the difference between the cash selling price and the consideration promised by the customer is due to factors other than financing (see <xref href="IFRS15_BC233.dita#IFRS15_BC233" id="IFRS15_X1978" base="F35619445" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC233</xref>).</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2453" base="F31839658" class="- topic/p ">the combined effect of (1) the expected length of time between when the entity transfers the promised goods or services to the customer and when the customer pays for those goods or services and (2) the prevailing interest rates in the relevant market.
