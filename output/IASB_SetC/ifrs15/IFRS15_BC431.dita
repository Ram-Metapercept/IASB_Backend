Accounting for those transactions as leases would be consistent with previous US GAAP, and a number of respondents, primarily from the automotive industry, explained that they viewed the transactions to be economically similar. However, the boards observed that while the cash flows may be similar, the customer’s ability to control the asset in each case is different. If the customer has a put option that it has significant economic incentive to exercise, the customer is restricted in its ability to consume, modify or sell the asset. However, when the entity guarantees that the customer will receive a minimum amount of sales proceeds, the customer is not constrained in its ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the benefits from, the asset. Thus, the boards decided that it was not necessary to expand the requirements for repurchase agreements to consider guaranteed amounts of resale.</p></body></paragraph>
