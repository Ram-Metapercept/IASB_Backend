This is because, in its view, the clarifications made to IFRS 15 by the amendments issued in April 2016 will assist all entities in applying the requirements for identifying performance obligations contained in <xref href="IFRS15_g22-30.dita#IFRS15_g22_30/IFRS15_g22_30_TI" id="IFRS15_X2189" base="F52282939" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs 22–30 of IFRS 15</xref>. <xref href="IFRS15_BC405.dita#IFRS15_BC405" id="IFRS15_X2190" base="F52282938" class="- topic/xref ">Paragraphs BC405–BC406 of IFRS 15</xref> explain that, as is the case with other contracts, contracts that include a promise to grant a licence to a customer require an assessment of the promises in the contract using the criteria for identifying performance obligations (see <xref href="IFRS15_27.dita#IFRS15_27/IFRS15_27_V2" id="IFRS15_X2191" base="F52282940" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs 27–30 of IFRS 15</xref>). This assessment is done before applying the criteria to determine the nature of an entity’s promise in granting a licence. Consequently, the entity considers all of the contractual terms to determine whether the promised rights result in the transfer to the customer of one or more licences. In making this determination, judgement is needed to distinguish contractual provisions that create promises to transfer rights to use the entity’s intellectual property from contractual provisions that establish when, where and how those rights may be used.</p></body></paragraph>
