The FASB noted that its intention is that if specific requirements in other Topics of the Codification deal with a transaction, the more detailed requirements from those other Topics should be applied rather than the requirements in Topic 606. For example, the FASB decided to exclude from the scope of Topic 606 guarantees (other than product warranties) that are within the scope of Topic 460 <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">Guarantees</i>, because the focus of the existing accounting requirements for those guarantee arrangements relates primarily to recognising and measuring a guarantee liability.</p></body></paragraph>
