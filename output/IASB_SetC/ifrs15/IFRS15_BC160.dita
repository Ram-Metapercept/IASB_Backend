For example, in a typical health club contract, the entity’s promise is to stand ready for a period of time (ie by making the health club available), rather than providing a service only when the customer requires it. In this case, the customer benefits from the entity’s service of making the health club available. This is evidenced by the fact that the extent to which the customer uses the health club does not, in itself, affect the amount of the remaining goods or services to which the customer is entitled. In addition, the customer is obliged to pay the consideration regardless of whether it uses the health club. Consequently, in those cases, the entity would need to select a measure of progress based on its service of making goods or services available, instead of when the customer uses the goods or services made available to them.</p></body></paragraph>
