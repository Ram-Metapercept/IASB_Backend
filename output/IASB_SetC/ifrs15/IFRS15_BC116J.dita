Therefore, entities should evaluate whether the promised goods or services in the contract are outputs or, instead, are inputs to a combined item (or items). In many cases, the inputs to a combined item concept might be further explained as a situation in which an entity’s promise to transfer goods or services results in a combined item that is more than (or substantively different from) the sum of those individual promised goods and services. For example, in a contract to build a wall, the promise to provide bricks and the promise to provide labour are not separately identifiable from each other within the context of the contract because those promises together comprise the promise to the customer to build the wall.</p></body></paragraph>
