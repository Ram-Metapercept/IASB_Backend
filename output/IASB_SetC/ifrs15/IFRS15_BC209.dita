In determining the appropriate level of confidence, the boards considered whether they could use the proposal in the 2011 Exposure Draft that constrained revenue to the amount to which an entity would be reasonably assured to be entitled. However, many respondents to the 2011 Exposure Draft were unsure about what the boards intended by using the term ‘reasonably assured’. Those respondents observed that the term is used elsewhere in IFRS, US GAAP and auditing requirements and further noted that its meaning is often interpreted differently in those contexts.</p></body></paragraph>
