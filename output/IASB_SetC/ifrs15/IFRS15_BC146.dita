The boards decided that that type of payment would meet that criterion if the entity’s right to retain (and not refund) that payment would be enforceable if the customer terminated the contract. Furthermore, the boards noted that the right to payment should be enforceable; otherwise, it is questionable whether the entity actually has a right to payment. Consequently, the boards included the factors in <xref href="IFRS15_B12.dita#IFRS15_B12" id="IFRS15_X1909" base="F35619153" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph B12 of IFRS 15</xref> to help an entity determine whether the right to payment would be enforceable.</p></body></paragraph>
