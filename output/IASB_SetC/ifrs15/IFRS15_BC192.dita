However, in some cases the promised consideration may be variable because the facts and circumstances indicate that the entity may accept a lower price than that stated in the contract (ie the contract contains an implicit price concession). The boards observed that an entity’s customary business practices, published policies or specific statements may provide evidence that the entity is willing to accept a lower price in exchange for the promised goods and services. For example, an entity might grant a price concession to a customer for goods that were previously sold to that customer to enable the customer to discount the goods and, therefore, more easily sell them to a third party. The boards noted that in many cases, price concessions are likely to be granted to enhance a customer relationship to encourage future sales to that customer.</p></body></paragraph>
