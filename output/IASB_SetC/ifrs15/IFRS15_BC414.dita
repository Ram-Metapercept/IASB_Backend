However, when the licence provides the customer with a right to use the entity’s intellectual property, the boards decided that the performance obligation will be satisfied at a point in time. In those cases, an entity would need to assess the point in time at which the performance obligation is satisfied (ie when the customer obtains control of the licence) by applying <xref href="IFRS15_g38-38.dita#IFRS15_g38_38" id="IFRS15_X2170" base="F35619966" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 38 of IFRS 15</xref>. The boards also decided to specify that control of a licence could not transfer before the beginning of the period during which the customer can use and benefit from the licenced property. If the customer cannot use and benefit from the licenced property then, by definition, it does not control the licence. The boards noted that when viewed from the entity’s perspective, performance may appear to be complete when a licence has been provided to the customer, even if the customer cannot yet use that licence.
