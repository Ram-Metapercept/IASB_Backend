In those cases, the simultaneous receipt and consumption of the asset that has been created means that the customer obtains control of the entity’s output as the entity performs and, thus, the entity’s performance obligation is satisfied over time. For example, consider an entity that promises to process transactions on behalf of a customer. The customer simultaneously receives and consumes a benefit as each transaction is processed.</p></body></paragraph>
