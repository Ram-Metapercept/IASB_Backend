Consequently, an entity should recognise a warranty liability and corresponding expense when it transfers the product to the customer and the liability should be measured in accordance with <xref href="../ias37/IAS37_TOC.dita#IAS37_TOC0001" base="F35619848" id="IFRS15_X2096" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 37</xref> or Topic 460 <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">Guarantees</i>. In contrast to the accounting for service-type warranties, an entity should not attribute any of the transaction price (and therefore revenue) to an assurance-type warranty. Some warranties may include both assurance features and service features. The boards decided that if an entity cannot reasonably account for those assurance features of the warranty separately from the service features, the entity should be allowed to account for the warranties together as a single performance obligation. That accounting ensures that the entity does not overstate the recognition of revenue at the time that the product transfers to the customer and also relieves the entity from identifying and accounting separately for the two components of the warranty coverage.</p></body></paragraph>
