For example, a contract might include a requirement for the customer to purchase a minimum quantity of goods from the entity each month, but the customer’s past practice indicates that the customer is not committed to always purchasing the minimum quantity each month and the entity does not enforce the requirement to purchase the minimum quantity. In that example, the criterion in <xref href="IFRS15_g9-45.dita#IFRS15_g9_45/IFRS15_g9_45_TI" id="IFRS15_X1754" base="F36247811" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 9(a) of IFRS 15</xref> could still be satisfied if there is evidence that demonstrates that the customer and the entity are substantially committed to the contract. The boards noted that requiring all of the rights and obligations to be fulfilled would have inappropriately resulted in no recognition of revenue for some contracts in which the parties are substantially committed to the contract.</p></body></paragraph>
