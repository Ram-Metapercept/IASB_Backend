The IASB observed that this question is largely unrelated to the application guidance on principal versus agent considerations in <xref href="IFRS15_B34.dita#IFRS15_B34/IFRS15_B34_V2" id="IFRS15_X2145" base="F52282864" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph B34–B38</xref> of IFRS 15, but rather relates to applying the requirements in <xref href="IFRS15_g46-90.dita#IFRS15_g46_90/IFRS15_g46_90_TI" id="IFRS15_X2146" base="F52282865" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs 46–90</xref> on determining the consideration to which an entity is entitled. The IASB noted that the situations in which an entity that is a principal may be unaware of the amount charged to end customers by an intermediary that is an agent are generally limited to situations in which the intermediary (a) has some flexibility in setting prices; or (b) is procuring the good or service on behalf of the end customer. The IASB concluded that the issue does not require any clarifications or additional guidance because the issue is expected to affect a limited number of entities and contracts.</p></body></paragraph>
