In contrast, if the objective is to limit the amount of revenue recognised, it might be more appropriate to constrain the cumulative amount of revenue recognised (ie include a constraint at Step 5). However, the boards observed that those are not truly independent objectives because the measurement of revenue determines the amount of revenue recognised. In other words, the requirements for constraining estimates of variable consideration restrict revenue recognition and use measurement uncertainty as the basis for determining if (or how much) revenue should be recognised. The boards noted that applying the requirements for constraining estimates of variable consideration to the transaction price or to the cumulative amount of revenue recognised should have an equal effect on the amount of revenue recognised in a contract.</p></body></paragraph>
