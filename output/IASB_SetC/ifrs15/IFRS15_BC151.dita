Other respondents in this industry explained that although they were able to conclude that their performance does not create an asset with an alternative use, they were unable to meet the ‘right to payment for performance completed to date’ criterion. This would mean that they would be able to recognise revenue only at the point in time when each unit transfers to the customer (often only after construction is complete and the customer has physical possession), which they stated would be an inappropriate depiction of their performance.</p></body></paragraph>
