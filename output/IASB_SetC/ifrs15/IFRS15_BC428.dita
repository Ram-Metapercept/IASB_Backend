Consequently, the customer has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the asset (ie the customer can sell, use up or consume the entire asset and choose not to exercise the put option). The boards decided that the entity should account for its obligation to stand ready to repurchase the asset, to be consistent with the accounting for the sale of a product with a right of return (see <xref href="IFRS15_gBC363-BC367.dita#IFRS15_gBC363_BC367" id="IFRS15_X2226" base="F35620004" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC363–BC367</xref>).
