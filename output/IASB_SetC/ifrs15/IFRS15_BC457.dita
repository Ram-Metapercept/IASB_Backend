This consultation included three formal exposure documents—a Discussion Paper and two Exposure Drafts—in response to which the boards received and assessed more than 1,500 comment letters. Over the course of the project, the boards and staff also held more than 650 meetings with users of financial statements, preparers, auditors, regulators and other interested parties in a wide range of industries and a number of jurisdictions. Those meetings included general educational sessions about the proposals and in-depth discussions in relation to particular topics. Some meetings also focused on gaining an understanding of the effects of the proposals in specific industries or on particular transactions. In some cases, the boards undertook additional outreach in those specific industries or on those particular topics for which there were significant operational or other concerns about the effects of the boards’ proposals. For example, because of the disparate views of preparers and users of financial statements on the topic of disclosure requirements, the boards sought further feedback in four workshops that brought user and preparer groups together to discuss how to balance the requirements to be more useful for users of financial statements and less burdensome for preparers (see <xref href="IFRS15_BC328.dita#IFRS15_BC328" id="IFRS15_X2283" base="F35620101" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC328</xref>). In addition, because of the effect of the principles for allocating the transaction price on a typical mobile phone contract, the boards also held a number of meetings with representatives from the telecommunications industry to better understand their concerns and so that those concerns could be considered during redeliberations. The boards’ consideration of the feedback received from this industry and their conclusions is included in <xref href="IFRS15_gBC287-BC293.dita#IFRS15_gBC287_BC293" id="IFRS15_X2284" base="F35620102" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC287–BC293</xref> and <xref href="IFRS15_gBC473-BC476.dita#IFRS15_gBC473_BC476" id="IFRS15_X2285" base="F35620103" class="- topic/xref ">BC473–BC476</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
