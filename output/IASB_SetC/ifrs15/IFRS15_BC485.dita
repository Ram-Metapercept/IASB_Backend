Conversely, the boards noted that other industries in which changes may be more significant may be required to create alternative performance measures to help users understand the difference between previous accounting requirements and the requirements under IFRS 15. However, because the requirements adequately depict performance, the boards do not expect that these performance measures would be necessary in the longer term.</p></body></paragraph>
