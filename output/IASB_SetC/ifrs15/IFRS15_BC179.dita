Some asked whether an entity’s inability to measure progress would mean that costs would also be deferred. However, the boards observed that unless the entity can recognise an asset from the costs to fulfil a contract in accordance with <xref href="IFRS15_95.dita#IFRS15_95" id="IFRS15_X1936" base="F35619315" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 95 of IFRS 15</xref>, those costs would not represent an asset of the entity and, therefore, should be recognised as expenses as they are incurred. </p></body></paragraph>
