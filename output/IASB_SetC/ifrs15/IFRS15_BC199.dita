They noted that a probability-weighted method reflects all of the uncertainties existing in the transaction price at the end of the reporting period. Therefore, it best reflects the conditions that are present at the end of each reporting period. For instance, it reflects the possibility of receiving a greater amount of consideration as well as the risk of receiving a lesser amount. However, the boards observed that users of financial statements are most interested in knowing the total amount of consideration that will ultimately be realised from the contract. Consequently, the boards decided that for the estimate of the transaction price to be meaningful at the end of each reporting period, it should be an amount that the entity expects to better predict the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled (the boards decided to address the issue of credit risk separately—see <xref href="IFRS15_gBC259-BC265.dita#IFRS15_gBC259_BC265" id="IFRS15_X1957" base="F35619364" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC259–BC265</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
