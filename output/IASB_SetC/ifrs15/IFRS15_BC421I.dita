This is because, as noted in <xref href="IFRS15_BC219.dita#IFRS15_BC219" id="IFRS15_X2216" base="F52283056" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC219</xref>, the objective of the royalties constraint is to prevent an entity from recognising revenue for uncertain amounts until the uncertainty is resolved (ie when the customer’s subsequent sales or usage occurs). In effect, the requirement in <xref href="IFRS15_B63.dita#IFRS15_B63" id="IFRS15_X2217" base="F52283057" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph B63</xref> constrains the amount of revenue that can be recognised when or as a performance obligation is satisfied, rather than constraining the total amount of the transaction price to be allocated. <xref href="IFRS15_B63.dita#IFRS15_B63" id="IFRS15_X2218" base="F52310686" class="- topic/xref ">Paragraph B63(b)</xref> reflects one of the key principles of IFRS 15, which is to recognise revenue only when (or as) an entity satisfies a performance obligation. If the entity has satisfied (or partially satisfied) the performance obligation to which the royalty relates, <xref href="IFRS15_B63.dita#IFRS15_B63" id="IFRS15_X2219" base="F52310687" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph B63(a)</xref> further constrains the recognition of revenue until the uncertainty about the amount of revenue is resolved. Consequently, an entity recognises revenue from a sales‑based or usage‑based royalty when (or as) the customer’s subsequent sales or usage occur, unless recognition in that manner would accelerate the recognition of revenue for the performance obligation to which the royalty solely or partially relates ahead of the entity’s performance towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation based on an appropriate measure of progress.</p></body></paragraph>
