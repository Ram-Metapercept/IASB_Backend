Instead, the entity should recognise revenue for the transferred goods in accordance with the core principle of IFRS 15. The boards also observed that if the entity applies a cost-to-cost method of measuring progress (ie costs incurred compared with total expected costs), the entity might (in the absence of clear requirements) include the cost of the goods in the cost-to-cost calculation and, therefore, recognise a contract-wide profit margin for the transfer of the goods. The boards noted that recognising a contract-wide profit margin before the goods are installed could overstate the measure of the entity’s performance and, therefore, revenue would be overstated. Alternatively, requiring an entity to estimate a profit margin that is different from the contract-wide profit margin could be complex and could effectively create a performance obligation for goods that are not distinct (thus bypassing the requirements for identifying performance obligations). Therefore, the boards decided that, in specified circumstances, an entity should recognise revenue for the transfer of the goods but only in an amount equal to the cost of those goods. In those circumstances, an entity should also exclude the costs of the goods from the cost‑to‑cost calculation to be consistent with the cost-to-cost methodology.</p></body></paragraph>
