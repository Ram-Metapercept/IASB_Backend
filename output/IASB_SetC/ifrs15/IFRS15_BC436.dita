For example, for contracts that were considered to be completed (as assessed under previous revenue Standards) several years before the date of initial application, an entity would, theoretically, need to obtain the relevant information to ensure that there was no effect on the pattern of revenue recognition in the financial statements in the year of initial application.</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2856" base="F31840448" class="- topic/p ">presenting the effect of IFRS 15 in the comparative years would incur significant preparation and audit costs, because a change in revenue could affect many other line items in the financial statements (such as deferred tax, receivables, interest and foreign currency gains/losses) as well as items that reference an entity’s revenue in the financial statements (such as taxes, statutory reporting and financing arrangements).</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(d)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2857" base="F31840450" class="- topic/p ">the historical information needed to estimate stand-alone selling prices of goods or services in a contract with many performance obligations may not exist.</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(e)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2858" base="F31840452" class="- topic/p ">entities make assumptions and estimates throughout a contract’s life, and it may not be possible to recreate the circumstances that apply historically without the use of hindsight.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
