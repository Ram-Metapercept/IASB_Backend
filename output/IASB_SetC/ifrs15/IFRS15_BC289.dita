Those requirements were previously used by many telecommunications entities applying US GAAP and IFRS. In the respondents’ view, carrying forward those requirements would have simplified the application of the revenue recognition model by limiting the amount of consideration that a telecommunications entity could allocate to a handset that is bundled with network services to the amount that is not contingent on the delivery of network services in the future. Consequently, revenue would have been recognised at the amount that the customer paid for the handset at contract inception when the handset was transferred to the customer. The remaining contractual payments would have been recognised subsequently as revenue as the entity provided network services to the customer. Many users of financial statements of entities in the telecommunications industry agreed that this revenue recognition pattern would have been useful because it closely relates to the timing of cash received.</p></body></paragraph>
