The application guidance explains that the most appropriate categories depend on facts and circumstances; however, an entity should consider how revenue is disaggregated in other communications or for the purposes of evaluating financial performance. This is because entities often already disaggregate revenue in those communications and the categories used may be those that are most useful for users of financial statements and that meet the objective in <xref href="IFRS15_114.dita#IFRS15_114" id="IFRS15_X2057" base="F35619720" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 114 of IFRS 15</xref>. The application guidance also includes a list of examples of categories (for example, geographical region or product type) by which an entity might disaggregate its revenue. The boards noted that the list of categories was compiled as examples that could be applied to many different entities, industries and contracts. As a result, the list should not be viewed either as a checklist or as an exhaustive list. However, the boards observed that an entity may need to disaggregate by more than one category to meet the objective.</p></body></paragraph>
