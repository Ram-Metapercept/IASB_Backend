In that assessment, the individual goods or services in a bundle would not be distinct if the risk that an entity assumes to fulfil its obligation to transfer one of those promised goods or services to the customer is a risk that is inseparable from the risk relating to the transfer of the other promised goods or services in that bundle. The boards considered whether to specify ‘separable risks’ as a necessary attribute of a distinct good or service. However, the boards decided that the concept of ‘separable risks’ may not be a practical criterion for determining whether a good or service is distinct.</p></body></paragraph>
