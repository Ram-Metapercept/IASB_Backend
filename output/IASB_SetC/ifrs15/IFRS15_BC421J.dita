The boards made this clarification in paragraph B63B because the boards concluded that (a) it would be more complex to account for part of a royalty under the royalties constraint and another part under the general requirements for variable consideration; and (b) doing so would not provide any additional useful information to users of financial statements. This is because splitting a royalty would result in an entity recognising an amount at contract inception that would reflect neither the amount to which the entity expects to be entitled based on its performance, nor the amount to which the entity has become legally entitled during the period.</p></body></paragraph>
