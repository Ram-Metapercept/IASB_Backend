Many entities have a large number of contracts and as a result some respondents noted practical challenges in applying the model on a contract-by-contract basis. These respondents questioned whether it would always be necessary to apply IFRS 15 on a contract-by-contract basis. The boards observed that the way in which an entity applies the model to its contracts is not a matter for which the boards should specify requirements. Nonetheless, in the light of the feedback, the boards decided to include a practical expedient in <xref href="IFRS15_4.dita#IFRS15_4" id="IFRS15_X1814" base="F35363070" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 4 of IFRS 15</xref> to acknowledge that a practical way to apply IFRS 15 to some contracts may be to use a ‘portfolio approach’. The boards acknowledged that an entity would need to apply judgement in selecting the size and composition of the portfolio in such a way that the entity reasonably expects that application of the revenue recognition model to the portfolio would not differ materially from the application of the revenue recognition model to the individual contracts or performance obligations in that portfolio. In their discussions, the boards indicated that they did not intend for an entity to quantitatively evaluate each outcome and, instead, the entity should be able to take a reasonable approach to determine the portfolios that would be appropriate for its types of contracts.</p></body></paragraph>
