Specifically, the cumulative effect would be an adjustment to the appropriate opening balance of equity in the year of initial application (ie comparative years would not be restated) for contracts that are not completed at the date of initial application.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS15_FN0027" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/> (The boards clarified that a completed contract is a contract in which the entity has fully performed in accordance with revenue recognition requirements in effect before the date of initial application. Thus, a completed contract would include a contract for which the entity’s performance was complete but there was a change in the transaction price after the date of initial application.)<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS15_FN0028" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/> The boards observed that the cumulative catch-up transition method responds to feedback from auditors and preparers by eliminating the need to restate prior periods and thus reducing costs.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
