A risk-free rate would have been observable and simple to apply in many jurisdictions and it would have avoided the costs of determining a rate specific to each contract. However, the boards decided that using a risk-free rate would not result in useful information, because the resulting interest rate would not have reflected the characteristics of the parties to the contract. In addition, the boards noted that it would not necessarily have been appropriate to use any rate explicitly specified in the contract because the entity might offer ‘cheap’ financing as a marketing incentive and, therefore, using that rate would not have resulted in an appropriate recognition of profit over the life of the contract. Consequently, the boards decided that an entity should apply the rate used in a financing transaction between the entity and its customer that does not involve the provision of goods or services because that rate reflects the characteristics of the party receiving financing in the contract. That rate also reflects the customer’s creditworthiness, among other risks.</p></body></paragraph>
