Under previous revenue Standards, entities often did not account for shipping provided in conjunction with the sale of their goods as an additional service. As a result, some stakeholders raised cost‑benefit concerns and asked whether relief should be provided in respect of shipping and handling activities from the general requirement to assess the goods or services promised in a contract with a customer in order to identify performance obligations.</p></body></paragraph>
