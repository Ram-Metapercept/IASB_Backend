Consequently, the FASB decided to amend the guidance in Subtopic 470‑40 that discusses arrangements in which an entity sells a product to another entity and, in a related transaction, agrees to repurchase the product. However, the FASB decided not to amend Subtopic 470‑40 for transactions in which an entity arranges for another party to purchase products on its behalf and agrees to purchase those products from the other party. In those cases, the entity is required to recognise the products as an asset and to recognise a related liability when the other party purchases the product. The FASB noted that although IFRS 15 results in similar accounting when the other party acts as an agent of the entity (ie the other party does not obtain control of the products), Subtopic 470‑40 provides explicit requirements for transactions in which no sale has occurred.</p></body></paragraph>
