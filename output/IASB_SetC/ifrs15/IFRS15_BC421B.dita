Some stakeholders held the view that the royalties constraint applies whenever the royalty relates to a licence of intellectual property, regardless of whether the royalty is also consideration for other goods or services in the contract. Other stakeholders had suggested that the royalties constraint applies only when the royalty relates solely to a licence that is distinct in accordance with <xref href="IFRS15_27.dita#IFRS15_27/IFRS15_27_V2" id="IFRS15_X2206" base="F52283015" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 27 of IFRS 15</xref> or only when the licence is the predominant item to which the royalty relates. Stakeholders had also indicated that it was unclear whether a single sales-based or usage-based royalty should be split into a portion to which the royalties constraint would apply and a portion to which it would not, for example, when the royalty relates to a licence and another good or service that is not a licence.</p></body></paragraph>
