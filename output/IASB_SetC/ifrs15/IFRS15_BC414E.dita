However, stakeholders have indicated that it was unclear whether the reference in IFRS 15 to changes in the intellectual property solely refers to changes in the form or functionality of the intellectual property, or also includes changes in the value of the intellectual property. This had resulted in different interpretations about how to apply the criteria in <xref href="IFRS15_B58.dita#IFRS15_B58/IFRS15_B58_V2" id="IFRS15_X2177" base="F52282868" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph B58(a)</xref>. Some stakeholders held the view that, for activities to significantly affect the intellectual property to which the customer has rights, those activities must be expected to change the form or functionality of that intellectual property. They thought that changes that solely affect the value of the intellectual property do not significantly affect the intellectual property to which the customer has rights. Others thought that activities that significantly affect the value of the intellectual property are sufficient to conclude that the licence provides a right to access the intellectual property.</p></body></paragraph>
