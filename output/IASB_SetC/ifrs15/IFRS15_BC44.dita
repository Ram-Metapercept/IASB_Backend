The boards noted that using the same term which has different meanings in US GAAP and IFRS could result in accounting that is not converged when determining whether the criterion in <xref href="IFRS15_g9-45.dita#IFRS15_g9_45/IFRS15_g9_45_TI" id="IFRS15_X1764" base="F36247804" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 9(e) of IFRS 15</xref> is met. However, the boards noted that the term ‘probable’ was used in some of the collectability thresholds in their previous revenue recognition requirements and both boards wanted to maintain consistency with those requirements. (The term ‘reasonably assured’ was also used in collectability thresholds in some parts of US GAAP. However, in this context, the FASB understood that in practice, probable and reasonably assured had similar meanings.) In addition, the boards observed that in most transactions, an entity would not enter into a contract with a customer in which there was significant credit risk associated with that customer without also having adequate economic protection to ensure that it would collect the consideration. Consequently, the boards decided that there would not be a significant practical effect of the different meaning of the same term because the population of transactions that would fail to meet the criterion in <xref href="IFRS15_g9-45.dita#IFRS15_g9_45/IFRS15_g9_45_TI" id="IFRS15_X1765" base="F36247803" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 9(e) of IFRS 15</xref> would be small.</p></body></paragraph>
