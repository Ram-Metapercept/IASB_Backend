Those users of financial statements noted that even though many entities currently recognise working capital balances such as unbilled receivables and deferred revenue, previous revenue recognition requirements did not require adequate disclosure about the relationship between those balances and the amount of revenue recognised. Consequently, the 2010 and the 2011 Exposure Drafts proposed that an entity disclose a reconciliation of the contract asset and the contract liability balances in a tabular format.</p></body></paragraph>
