In their view, recognising different profit margins for different parts of a single performance obligation is inconsistent with the principle of identifying performance obligations. Other respondents disagreed with recognising revenue for uninstalled materials at a zero profit margin because it might not properly depict an entity’s rights under the contract (for example, if the entity was entitled on termination of the contract to a payment at an amount that reflects the contract-wide margin for all work performed, including the transfer of uninstalled materials to the customer).</p></body></paragraph>
