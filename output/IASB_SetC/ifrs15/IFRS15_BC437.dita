Consequently, the boards considered how the burden of retrospective application could be eased while, at the same time, retaining the benefits of comparability and consistency that retrospective application would provide. To ease the burden of transition without sacrificing comparability, the boards decided to allow an entity to elect to use one or more of the following practical expedients when applying IFRS 15 retrospectively.</p> <table outputclass="ruled" base="SL49527905" frame="all" id="IFRS15_TAB0037" orient="port" class="- topic/table "><tgroup cols="2" class="- topic/tgroup "><colspec align="left" colname="C1" colnum="1" colsep="1" colwidth="30*" rowsep="1" class="- topic/colspec "/><colspec align="left" colname="C2" colnum="2" colsep="1" colwidth="70*" rowsep="1" class="- topic/colspec "/><thead class="- topic/thead "><row class="- topic/row "><entry align="left" colname="C1" valign="middle" class="- topic/entry "> <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Practical expedient</b></entry><entry align="left" colname="C2" valign="middle" class="- topic/entry "> <b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Rationale</b></entry></row></thead><tbody class="- topic/tbody "><row keep_together="1" class="- topic/row "><entry align="left" nameend="C2" namest="C1" valign="top" class="- topic/entry "> <p id="IFRS15_P2880" typeface="sansserif" class="- topic/p "><i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">Reducing the number of contracts that require restatement<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS15_FN0025" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/></i></p></entry></row><row class="- topic/row "><entry align="left" colname="C1" valign="top" class="- topic/entry "> <p base="F49527913" id="IFRS15_P2881" class="- topic/p ">For contracts completed before the date of initial application of IFRS 15, an entity need not restate contracts that begin and end within the same annual reporting period.</p></entry><entry align="left" colname="C2" valign="top" class="- topic/entry "> <p base="F49527915" id="IFRS15_P2882" class="- topic/p ">In considering whether an entity should be required to review and restate all contracts completed before the date of initial application, the boards decided that trend information should be preserved for completed contracts that span annual reporting periods. Consequently, the boards decided to limit the relief to only those contracts that begin and end within the same annual reporting period, because the amount and timing of revenue recognition relating to those contracts would not change between annual reporting periods.
