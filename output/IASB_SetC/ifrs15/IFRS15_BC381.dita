This is because identifying the nature of the entity’s performance obligation is necessary for the entity to determine whether it controls the goods or services that have been promised before they are transferred to a customer. For example, a travel agent could be the principal in some contracts with customers if the travel agent determines that its promise is to provide a right to a flight (ie a ticket), instead of a promise to provide the flight. However, to conclude whether they are a principal or an agent, the travel agent would need to also consider whether it controlled that right before transferring it to the customer, which may occur when the travel agent purchases the tickets in advance for sales to future customers.</p></body></paragraph>
