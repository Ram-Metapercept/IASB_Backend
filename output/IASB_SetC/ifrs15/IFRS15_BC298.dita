The boards observed that, conceptually, an entity may obtain a contract asset as a result of its efforts to obtain a contract (because the measure of the remaining rights might exceed the measure of the remaining obligations). However, because the principle in IFRS 15 requires an entity to recognise a contract asset and revenue only as a result of satisfying a performance obligation in the contract, the boards observed that on the basis of that reasoning, the contract asset would be measured at zero at contract inception and any costs of obtaining a contract would therefore be recognised as expenses when incurred.</p></body></paragraph>
