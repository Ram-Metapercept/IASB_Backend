However, the boards observe that the pattern of transfer may be different for different real estate contracts because it will depend on the relevant facts and circumstances of each contract. For example, some real estate contracts may result in an asset that cannot (under the terms of the contract) be readily directed to another customer (ie the entity’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity), and the contracts require the customer to pay for performance completed to date (thus meeting the criterion in <xref href="IFRS15_35.dita#IFRS15_35" id="IFRS15_X1913" base="F35619235" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 35(c) of IFRS 15</xref>). However, other real estate contracts that create an asset with no alternative use to the entity may not require the customer to pay for performance completed to date. Therefore, an entity would reach a different conclusion on the pattern of transfer for those contracts.</p></body></paragraph>
