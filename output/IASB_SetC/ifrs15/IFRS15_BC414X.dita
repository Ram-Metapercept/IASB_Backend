In some cases, it might be necessary for an entity to consider the nature of its promise in granting a licence even when the licence is not distinct. The IASB discussed an example in which an entity grants a 10‑year licence that is not distinct from a one‑year service arrangement. The IASB noted that a distinct licence that provides access to an entity’s intellectual property over a 10‑year period could not be considered completely satisfied before the end of the access period. The IASB observed that it would, therefore, be inappropriate to conclude that a single performance obligation that includes that licence is satisfied over the one‑year period of the service arrangement. <xref href="IFRS15_BC407.dita#IFRS15_BC407" id="IFRS15_X2201" base="F52283011" class="- topic/xref ">Paragraph BC407</xref> further highlights that an entity considers the nature of its promise in granting the licence if the licence is the primary or dominant component (ie the predominant item) of a single performance obligation.</p></body></paragraph>
