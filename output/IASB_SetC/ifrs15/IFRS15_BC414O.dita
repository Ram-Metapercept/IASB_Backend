For example, an arrangement might grant a customer a licence of a well-known television programme or movie for a period of time (for example, three years), but the customer might be restricted to showing that licensed content only once per year during each of those three years. Those stakeholders acknowledged that <xref href="IFRS15_B62.dita#IFRS15_B62" id="IFRS15_X2186" base="F52282935" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph B62</xref> is clear that restrictions of time, geographical region or use do not affect the licensor's determination about whether the licence is satisfied over time or at a point in time. However, in their view, it was unclear whether contractual restrictions affect the entity’s identification of its promises in the contract (ie whether the airing restrictions affect whether the entity has granted one licence or three licences). Subsequent to the publication, in July 2015, of the Exposure Draft <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Clarifications to IFRS 15</ph></ph>, the TRG discussed some further examples considering whether particular contractual restrictions create separate promises or, instead, merely define attributes of a promise. The TRG also discussed time attributes within the context of applying <xref href="IFRS15_B61.dita#IFRS15_B61" id="IFRS15_X2187" base="F52282936" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph B61 of IFRS 15</xref> to renewals of, or extensions to, existing licences (see <xref href="IFRS15_gBC414S-BC414U.dita#IFRS15_gBC414S_BC414U/IFRS15_gBC414S_BC414U_TI" id="IFRS15_X2188" base="F52282937" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC414S–BC414U</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
