Previous US GAAP revenue recognition requirements for the software industry specified that an offer of a discount on future purchases of goods or services was presumed to be a separate option in the contract, if that discount was significant and also incremental both to the range of discounts reflected in the pricing of other elements in that contract and to the range of discounts typically given in comparable transactions. Those notions of ‘significant’ and ‘incremental’ form the basis for the principle of a material right that is used to differentiate between an option and a marketing or promotional offer. However, the boards observed that even if the offered discount is not incremental to other discounts in the contract, it nonetheless could, in some cases, give rise to a material right to the customer. Consequently, the boards decided not to carry forward that part of the previous revenue recognition requirements from US GAAP into IFRS 15.</p></body></paragraph>
