They did this because many users of financial statements observed that information about contract balances would be particularly important for entities that enter into long‑term contracts with customers or that carry significant contract liability balances for other reasons (for example, prepaid service contracts). However, the boards rejected this alternative for the following reasons:</p><ol outputclass="static" id="IFRS15_L0204" base="F31840078" type="lower-alpha" class="- topic/ol "><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2632" base="F31840079" class="- topic/p ">it would have been difficult to clearly identify the types of contracts or industries for which a reconciliation would (or would not) provide useful information.</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2633" base="F31840081" class="- topic/p ">limiting the scope of the reconciliation would have added complexity.
