To be consistent with that approach, the boards decided that an entity should measure non-cash consideration at fair value. The non-cash consideration could be in the form of goods or services, but it may also be in the form of a financial instrument or property, plant and equipment. For example, an entity might receive an electrical substation in exchange for connecting houses in a new residential development to the electricity network.</p></body></paragraph>
