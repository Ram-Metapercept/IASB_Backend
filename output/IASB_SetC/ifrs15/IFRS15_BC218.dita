However, the entity might determine that it is highly probable that including some of the estimate of the variable consideration in the transaction price would not result in a significant revenue reversal. The boards decided that, in such cases, the entity should include that amount in the estimate of the transaction price. Respondents to both the 2010 and the 2011 Exposure Drafts supported including some of the variable consideration in the transaction price (and therefore recognising that portion as revenue when the entity satisfies the related performance obligation) if including that amount would meet the objective of the requirements for constraining estimates of variable consideration.</p></body></paragraph>
