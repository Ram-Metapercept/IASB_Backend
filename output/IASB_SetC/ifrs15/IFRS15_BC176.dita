This would be the case if the cost-to-cost method includes costs attributable to wasted materials or other inefficiencies that do not contribute to the satisfaction of a performance obligation. Consequently, an entity should exclude the effects of any inputs that do not depict the transfer of control of goods or services to the customer (for example, the costs of wasted materials, labour or other resources to fulfil the contract that were not reflected in the price of the contract). In that regard, the requirements in <xref href="IFRS15_B19.dita#IFRS15_B19" id="IFRS15_X1935" base="F35619314" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph B19 of IFRS 15</xref> can be viewed as a reminder that a mechanical application of the cost-to-cost method might not always provide a faithful depiction of the entity’s performance.</p></body></paragraph>
