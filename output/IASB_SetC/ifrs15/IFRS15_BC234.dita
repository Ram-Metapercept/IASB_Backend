In other words, for those contracts, the financing component will not be significant. During their redeliberations, the boards clarified that an entity should consider only the <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">significance</i> of a financing component at a contract level rather than consider whether the financing is <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">material</i> at a portfolio level. The boards decided that it would have been unduly burdensome to require an entity to account for a financing component if the effects of the financing component were not material to the individual contract, but the combined effects for a portfolio of similar contracts were material to the entity as a whole.</p></body></paragraph>
