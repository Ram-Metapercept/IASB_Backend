That guidance is anchored in applying key steps of the revenue recognition model—specifically, identifying the performance obligations in a contract and assessing the transfer of control, which the boards operationalised by differentiating between two types of licences. The boards also decided to include in the application guidance the rationale for the guidance and additional illustrative examples to explain the intention, objective and application of those steps and the differentiation between licences.</p></body></paragraph>
