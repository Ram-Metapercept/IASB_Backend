This approach balances the needs of users of financial statements with preparers’ concerns because the qualitative and quantitative disclosures provide users of financial statements with the information they requested (ie information on when contract assets are typically transferred to accounts receivable or collected as cash and when contract liabilities are recognised as revenue). In addition, the boards decided that those disclosures would be more cost-effective than a reconciliation. The boards also observed that this approach would not result in a significant change for many entities that are already disclosing similar information. For example, the boards observed that some long-term construction entities already disclosed information relating to balances similar to contract assets and contract liabilities—often referred to as ‘due from customers’ or ‘unbilled accounts receivable’ and ‘due to customers’ or ‘deferred revenue’.</p></body></paragraph>
