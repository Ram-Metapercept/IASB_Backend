(A contract liability arises if an entity receives consideration from a customer before the entity satisfies its performance obligations to the customer.) This is because the amount of the remaining performance obligations for which cash has been received is useful information. However, the boards noted that contract liabilities are a subset of the amounts disclosed as the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations and <xref href="IFRS15_116.dita#IFRS15_116" id="IFRS15_X2074" base="F35619767" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 116(a) of IFRS 15</xref> already requires the contract liability balance to be disclosed. Consequently, the boards decided that no further disclosures should be required.</p></body></paragraph>
