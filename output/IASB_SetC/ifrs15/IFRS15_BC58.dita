For example, an oil supplier may swap inventory with another oil supplier to reduce transport costs, meet immediate inventory needs, or otherwise facilitate the sale of oil to the end customer. The boards noted that the party exchanging inventory with the entity meets the definition of a customer, because it has contracted with the entity to obtain an output of the entity’s ordinary activities.
