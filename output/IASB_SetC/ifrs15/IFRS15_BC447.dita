However, many respondents, including respondents in industries for which there could be significant process and system changes required to comply with IFRS 15 (for example, in the telecommunications and software industries), indicated that the proposed formula would not provide them with adequate time. Specifically, those respondents explained that providing only a short time before the earliest comparative period would not be sufficient to ensure that processes and systems were in place to capture the information that would be required to apply IFRS 15 retrospectively. Some respondents further explained that because of the large volume of contracts in their businesses, it would be far more cost‑effective to process the information on a real‑time basis to ensure that the adjustments to the financial statements were being calculated during the transition period, rather than attempting to retrospectively calculate the adjustments at the date of initial application.</p></body></paragraph>
