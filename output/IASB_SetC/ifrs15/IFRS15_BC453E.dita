IASB members observed that the issuance of IFRS 15 in May 2014 had been later than anticipated by some months, not years. Accordingly, a deferral of the effective date of IFRS 15 for anything longer than one year would unnecessarily delay transition by many entities to a new Standard that the IASB views as a substantial improvement to financial reporting.</p></body></paragraph>
