Those respondents observed that such methods appear to be output methods and, therefore, questioned whether they would always provide the most appropriate depiction of an entity’s performance. The boards observed that such methods may be appropriate in some cases; however, they may not always result in the best depiction of an entity’s performance if the performance obligation is satisfied over time. This is because a units-of-delivery or a units-of-production method ignores the work in progress that belongs to the customer. When that work in progress is material to either the contract or the financial statements as a whole, the boards observed that using a units-of-delivery or a units-of-production method would distort the entity’s performance because it would not recognise revenue for the assets that are created before delivery or before production is complete but are controlled by the customer.</p></body></paragraph>
