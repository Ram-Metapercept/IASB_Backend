In the IASB’s view, clarity about the interaction between the control principle and the indicators could have been achieved by amending only the Illustrative Examples. The IASB noted concerns about adding explanatory text to the indicators in paragraph B37 because of (a) the risk of new questions arising with respect to those additional explanations; and (b) the risk that some of those additional explanations might be used inappropriately to reach a conclusion that an entity is a principal when the entity is an agent. Nonetheless, despite those concerns, the IASB decided to amend the indicators in paragraph B37 of IFRS 15 in order to align the wording of the amendments with the wording of those made by the FASB. The IASB concluded that the benefits of retaining converged requirements on this topic outweigh the potential costs of amending the requirements.</p></body></paragraph>
