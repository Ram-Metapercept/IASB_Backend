This is because the notion of ‘benefit’ can be subjective. Consider, for example, a freight logistics contract in which the entity has agreed to transport goods from Vancouver to New York City. Many respondents suggested that the customer receives no benefit from the entity’s performance until the goods are delivered to New York City. However, the boards observed that the customer does benefit from the entity’s performance as it occurs because if the goods were delivered only part way (for example, to Chicago), another entity would not need to substantially re‑perform the entity’s performance to date—that is, another entity would not need to take the goods back to Vancouver to deliver them to New York City. The boards observed that, in those cases, the assessment of whether another entity would need to substantially re‑perform the performance completed to date can be used as an objective basis for determining whether the customer receives benefit from the entity’s performance as it is provided.</p></body></paragraph>
