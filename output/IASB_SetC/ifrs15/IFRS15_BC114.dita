Otherwise, the entity would be required to identify multiple distinct goods or services, allocate the transaction price to each of the resulting performance obligations on a stand-alone selling price basis and then recognise revenue when those performance obligations are satisfied. For example, in a repetitive service contract such as a cleaning contract, transaction processing or a contract to deliver electricity, an entity would be required to allocate the overall consideration to each increment of service (for example, each hour of cleaning) to be provided in the contract. The boards decided that it would not be cost-effective to apply the model in this manner and determined that including <xref href="IFRS15_22.dita#IFRS15_22" id="IFRS15_X1865" base="F35363508" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 22(b) of IFRS 15</xref> as part of the definition of a performance obligation would alleviate costs. This is because when <xref href="IFRS15_22.dita#IFRS15_22" id="IFRS15_X1866" base="F35363509" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 22(b) of IFRS 15</xref> applies (ie the contract includes a promise to transfer a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer), an entity will identify a single performance obligation and allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation. The entity will then recognise revenue by applying a single measure of progress to that performance obligation.</p></body></paragraph>
