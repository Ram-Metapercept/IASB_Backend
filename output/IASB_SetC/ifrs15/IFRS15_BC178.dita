Instead, the boards decided to emphasise that the objective of measuring progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation is to depict an entity’s performance in the contract and therefore a cost-to-cost calculation may require adjustment if some of the costs incurred do not contribute to the progress in the contract.</p></body></paragraph>
