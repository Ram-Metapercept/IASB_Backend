The IASB decided not to provide a similar accounting policy choice in IFRS 15.

The IASB did not amend the criteria in IFRS 15 to determine the nature of the licence but clarified that the assessment of whether the entity’s activities significantly change the intellectual property to which the customer has rights is based on whether those activities affect the intellectual property’s ability to provide benefit to the customer. The FASB decided to amend the criteria to determine the nature of the licence by requiring an entity to classify the intellectual property underlying the licence as functional or symbolic based on whether the intellectual property has significant stand‑alone functionality. A licence to functional intellectual property is considered a right to use, while a licence to symbolic intellectual property is considered a right to access the underlying intellectual property.
