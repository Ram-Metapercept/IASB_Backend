Therefore, the boards decided to include requirements regarding contract modifications in IFRS 15 to improve consistency in the accounting for contract modifications. As the revenue recognition model developed, the boards proposed different approaches to account for contract modifications. However, each approach was developed with the overall objective of faithfully depicting an entity’s rights and obligations in the modified contract. The boards concluded that to faithfully depict the rights and obligations arising from a modified contract, an entity should account for some modifications prospectively and for other modifications on a cumulative catch-up basis.</p></body></paragraph>
