The IASB noted that it expects practice to develop consistently with the boards’ intentions in developing the collectability criterion in <xref href="IFRS15_9.dita#IFRS15_9" id="IFRS15_X1773" base="F51967196" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 9(e)</xref>. The IASB does not expect the FASB’s anticipated clarifications to the paragraph equivalent to paragraph 9(e) in Topic 606 to result in any additional differences in outcomes. In reaching its decision, the IASB observed that an entity will generally not enter into a contract with a customer if the entity does not consider it to be probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer. This is consistent with the boards’ reasoning in <xref href="IFRS15_BC43.dita#IFRS15_BC43" id="IFRS15_X1774" base="F51967197" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC43</xref>. It was not the boards’ intention that many contracts should fail the condition in paragraph 9(e). On this basis, the IASB thinks that the population of contracts to which any clarification to paragraph 9(e) might apply is small.</p></body></paragraph>
