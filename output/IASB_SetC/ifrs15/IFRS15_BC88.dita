Examples of such promised goods or services may include ‘free’ handsets provided by telecommunication entities, ‘free’ maintenance provided by automotive manufacturers and customer loyalty points awarded by supermarkets, airlines and hotels. Those respondents stated that revenue should be recognised only for the main goods or services for which the customer has contracted and not for what they consider to be marketing incentives and other incidental obligations.</p></body></paragraph>
