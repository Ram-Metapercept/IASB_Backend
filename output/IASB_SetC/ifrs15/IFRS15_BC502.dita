The boards noted that undertaking a separate project would mean that changes to existing Standards would not be made until that project had been completed and became effective. Because of the boards’ other standard-setting priorities, and the time required to complete all relevant due process steps for issuing a standard, it might be several years before the existing requirements were replaced. The boards observed that the implications of not proceeding with the proposed consequential amendments would have been as follows:</p><ol outputclass="static" base="F31852591" id="IFRS15_L0252" type="lower-alpha" class="- topic/ol "><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(a)</li_value> <p base="F31852592" id="IFRS15_P3048" class="- topic/p ">for IFRS reporters, the IASB would have needed to amend <xref href="../ias16/IAS16_TOC.dita#IAS16_TOC0001/IAS16_TOC0001_V2" base="F36247863" id="IFRS15_X2302" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 16</xref>, <xref href="../ias38/IAS38_TOC0001.dita#IAS38_TOC0001/IAS38_TOC0001_V2" base="F36247943" id="IFRS15_X2303" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 38</xref> and <xref href="../ias40/IAS40_TOC0001.dita#IAS40_TOC0001" base="F35620198" id="IFRS15_X2304" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 40</xref> to include the revenue recognition criteria from previous revenue Standards in IFRS.
