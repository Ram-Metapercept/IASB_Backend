Nonetheless, the boards decided to address preparers’ concerns about costs of preparation as follows:</p><ol outputclass="static" id="IFRS15_L0207" base="F31840111" type="lower-alpha" class="- topic/ol "><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2650" base="F31840112" class="- topic/p ">providing practical expedients to limit the scope of the disclosure (see <xref href="IFRS15_121.dita#IFRS15_121" id="IFRS15_X2069" base="F35619762" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 121 of IFRS 15</xref>).

This is because users indicated that information for remaining performance obligations is most critical to their analyses when the contracts are long-term. In addition, including the practical expedient in <xref href="IFRS15_121.dita#IFRS15_121" id="IFRS15_X2071" base="F35619764" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 121(b) of IFRS 15</xref> would maintain the relief provided to an entity in <xref href="IFRS15_B16.dita#IFRS15_B16" id="IFRS15_X2072" base="F35619765" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph B16 of IFRS 15</xref> on measuring progress for those performance obligations (ie performance obligations for which the entity has a right to consideration that corresponds directly with its performance completed to date). The boards provided practical expedients rather than specifically limiting the scope because some preparers commented that it would be easier for them to comply with the requirement from an accounting systems and processes perspective if they could choose to include all of their remaining performance obligations in the disclosure.</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P2651" base="F31840115" class="- topic/p ">eliminating the prescriptive approach to disclosing when the entity expects to satisfy its remaining performance obligations (see <xref href="IFRS15_120.dita#IFRS15_120" id="IFRS15_X2073" base="F35619766" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 120 of IFRS 15</xref>). Initially, the boards proposed that an entity should follow a prescriptive approach in determining when the entity expects to satisfy its remaining performance obligations (ie by requiring a quantitative disclosure of the remaining performance obligations, scheduled into one-year time bands). However, many respondents disagreed with that proposal on the basis that the rigid nature of the prescribed time bands would imply a degree of precision in the timing of revenue recognition that may not exist and, furthermore, would increase the costs of preparation. In response to that feedback, the boards decided to permit an entity to estimate and present such information either on a quantitative basis, with time bands that are most appropriate for the duration of the remaining performance obligations (ie not necessarily one-year time bands) or by using qualitative information (or both).</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
