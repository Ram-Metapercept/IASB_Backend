These stakeholders also stated that the variety of, and changes in, tax laws among jurisdictions contributes to that complexity. Consequently, some preparers and auditors asked the boards to amend the Standard to add a practical expedient to reduce the complexity and practical difficulties in assessing whether a sales tax is collected on behalf of a third party. An accounting policy choice to either include or exclude all sales taxes in or from revenue was available in the previous revenue standards under US GAAP.</p></body></paragraph>
