The boards had proposed a similar requirement in the 2011 Exposure Draft because both users and preparers of financial statements indicated that it would not be useful for an entity to recognise a minimum amount of revenue for those contracts. This is because that approach would inevitably have required the entity to report, throughout the life of the contract, significant adjustments to the amount of revenue recognised at inception of the contract as a result of changes in circumstances, even though those changes in circumstances are not related to the entity’s performance. The boards observed that this would not result in relevant information, particularly in contracts in which the sales-based or usage-based royalty is paid over a long period of time.</p></body></paragraph>
