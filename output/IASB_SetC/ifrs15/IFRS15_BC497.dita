Because Subtopic 360‑20 <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">Real Estate Sales</i> provided requirements for recognising profit on <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">all</i> real estate sales, regardless of whether real estate is an output of an entity’s ordinary activities, the FASB considered the implications of retaining the requirements in Subtopic 360‑20 for contracts that are not within the scope of Topic 606. The FASB noted that retaining those requirements could result in an entity recognising the profit or loss on a real estate sale differently, depending on whether the transaction is a contract with a customer. However, there is economically little difference between the sale of real estate that is an output of the entity’s ordinary activities and the sale of real estate that is not. Consequently, the difference in accounting should relate only to the presentation of the profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income—revenue and expense or gain or loss.</p></body></paragraph>
