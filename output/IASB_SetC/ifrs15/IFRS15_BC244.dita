Consequently, the accounting for a trade receivable arising from a contract that has a significant financing component should be comparable to the accounting for a loan with the same features. Consider the following example: Customer A purchases a good on credit and promises to pay CU1,000 in three years. The present value of this trade receivable is CU751. Now consider Customer B who borrows CU751 from a bank with a promise to pay CU1,000 in three years. Customer B uses the loan to purchase the same good as Customer A. Economically, those transactions are the same, but, in the absence of the requirements in IFRS 15 to account for a significant financing component, the form of the transaction would determine whether an entity would recognise revenue of CU751 or CU1,000 (ie on a discounted or an undiscounted basis). For this reason, <xref href="IFRS15_g60-65.dita#IFRS15_g60_65" id="IFRS15_X1986" base="F35619482" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs 60–65 of IFRS 15</xref> require a contract with a financing component that is significant to the contract to be separated, which results in the same revenue recognition for both transactions.</p></body></paragraph>
