Although US GAAP was improved after the Revenue Recognition project began, deficiencies still existed. For example, there was no definition of a ‘deliverable’ in previous US GAAP, even though the term was used to determine the unit of account for revenue transactions. IFRS had even fewer requirements because it only acknowledged that revenue could be recognised for ‘separately identifiable components of a single transaction’, without providing guidance on how to determine what constituted a ‘separately identifiable component’.</p></body></paragraph>
