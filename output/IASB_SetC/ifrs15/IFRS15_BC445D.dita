In relation to the words ‘transferred all of the goods or services’ in the definition of a completed contract, the IASB noted that it did not intend that an entity would apply the ‘transfer of control’ notion in IFRS 15 to goods or services identified in accordance with previous revenue Standards. The IASB noted that <xref href="IFRS15_BC441.dita#IFRS15_BC441/IFRS15_BC441_V2" id="IFRS15_X2255" base="F52283098" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC441</xref> refers to performance in accordance with previous revenue Standards. Consequently, in many situations the term ‘transferred’ would mean ‘delivered’ within the context of contracts for the sale of goods and ‘performed’ within the context of contracts for rendering services and construction contracts. In some situations, the entity would use judgement when determining whether it has transferred goods or services to the customer. For example, an entity may need to use judgement to determine when it has transferred rights to use its assets (for example, rights granted within a licence agreement), because there is no specific guidance on the transfer or delivery of such rights in IAS 18.</p></body></paragraph>
