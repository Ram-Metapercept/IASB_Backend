The fact that the entity will not provide the goods or services itself is not determinative. Instead, the entity evaluates whether it controls the right to goods or services before that right is transferred to the customer. In doing so, it is often relevant to assess whether the right is created only when it is obtained by the customer, or whether the right to goods or services exists before the customer obtains the right. If the right does not exist before the customer obtains it, an entity would be unable to control that right before it is transferred to the customer.</p></body></paragraph>
