However, the boards observed that it would be difficult to clearly define a service and not all contracts that are commonly regarded as services result in a transfer of resources to customers over time. Furthermore, the boards decided that the notion of control should apply equally to both goods and services. Consequently, to address respondents’ concerns, the boards decided to specify requirements that focus on the attribute of the timing of when a performance obligation is satisfied (ie when a good or service is transferred to a customer). Accordingly, IFRS 15 includes criteria for determining whether a performance obligation is satisfied over time. Those criteria are explained in the following paragraphs.</p></body></paragraph>
