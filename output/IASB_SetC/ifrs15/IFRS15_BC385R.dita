The boards concluded (in <xref href="IFRS15_B35A.dita#IFRS15_B35A/IFRS15_B35A_V1" id="IFRS15_X2130" base="F52062343" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph B35A(c)</xref>) that when an entity provides a significant service of integrating two or more goods or services into the combined output that is the specified good or service for which the customer contracted, it controls that specified good or service before it is transferred to the customer. When the entity provides a significant integration service it controls the inputs to the combined item that is the specified good or service (including goods or services provided by another party that are inputs to the specified good or service). The entity controls the inputs by directing their use to create the combined item. In that case, the inputs provided by the other party would be a fulfilment cost to the entity. In contrast, if a third party provides the significant integration service, then the entity’s customer for its goods or services (which would be inputs to the specified good or service) is likely to be the other party.</p></body></paragraph>
