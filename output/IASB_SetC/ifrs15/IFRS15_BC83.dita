This may occur because the estimate of the amount of variable consideration in the initial contract has changed or is no longer constrained. Specifically, those respondents asked whether, in those circumstances, an entity should allocate the corresponding change in the transaction price to the performance obligations in the modified contract, or to the performance obligations identified in the contract before the modification (ie the initial contract), including to performance obligations that were satisfied before the modification. In response to that feedback, the boards clarified in <xref href="IFRS15_90.dita#IFRS15_90" id="IFRS15_X1833" base="F35363162" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 90 of IFRS 15</xref> that the allocation of the change in transaction price in those circumstances depends on whether, and the extent to which, the change in the transaction price is attributable to an amount of variable consideration promised before the modification. In providing that clarification, the boards noted that it would be appropriate in those circumstances to allocate a change in the transaction price to the performance obligations identified in the initial contract, if the promised variable consideration and the resolution of the uncertainty associated with that amount of variable consideration are not affected by the contract modification.</p></body></paragraph>
