The primary reason for that decision was the lack of clear requirements in US GAAP for accounting for the transfer of non-financial assets when those assets are not an output of an entity’s ordinary activities and do not constitute a business or non-profit activity. In addition, the FASB decided, due to the lack of guidance in Topics 350 and 360, to add guidance for how to account for a contract that fails to meet the criteria in paragraph 606‑10‑25‑1.</p></body></paragraph>
