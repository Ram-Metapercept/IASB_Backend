They expressed concerns about differences in wording between IFRS and US GAAP and also indicated that the FASB’s proposed amendments would improve the understanding of the separately identifiable principle and the operability of the requirements. Step 2 is a fundamental part of IFRS 15 that affects accounting in subsequent steps of the revenue recognition model. Consequently, in its redeliberations of the amendments the IASB concluded that the benefits of retaining converged requirements on this topic outweigh the potential costs of amending the requirements. Accordingly, the IASB decided to amend IFRS 15 to clarify the principle and the factors that indicate when two or more promises to transfer goods or services are not separately identifiable. Those amendments are the same as the FASB’s related amendments to Topic 606.</p></body></paragraph>
