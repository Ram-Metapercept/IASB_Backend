The boards decided that this approach is the most appropriate because it addresses the challenges identified in the 2011 Exposure Draft and still provides users of financial statements with the information that they had said would be most useful, which is gross revenue to provide revenue trend information and the impairment loss to provide information on receivables management (or bad debts). Furthermore, the boards noted that this would provide greater consistency with the accounting for impairment losses on contracts with customers that include a significant financing component.</p></body></paragraph>
