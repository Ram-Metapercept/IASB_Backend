In making their decision, the boards considered the feedback received from users of financial statements. The majority of users of financial statements that were consulted indicated that the most relevant measure for revenue in a reporting period would be one that will not result in a significant reversal in a subsequent period. This is because an amount that would not reverse in the future would help users of financial statements better predict future revenues of an entity. Therefore, the boards decided that the focus for constraining revenue should be on possible downward adjustments (ie revenue reversals), rather than on all revenue adjustments (ie both downward and upward adjustments). Specifically, the boards decided that an entity should include some or all of an estimate of variable consideration in the transaction price only to the extent it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur.</p></body></paragraph>
