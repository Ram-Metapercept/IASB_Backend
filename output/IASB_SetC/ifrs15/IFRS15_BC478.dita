However, previous practices were broadly consistent with this approach and many entities determined the amount of revenue on the basis of the amounts the customer promised to pay. Where IFRS 15 differs from previous revenue recognition requirements is in the additional guidance it provides for estimating consideration when it is variable and in constraining those estimates to ensure revenue is not overstated. In addition, IFRS 15 provides requirements related to other aspects of measuring revenue such as accounting for significant financing components, non-cash consideration and consideration payable to a customer.</p></body></paragraph>
