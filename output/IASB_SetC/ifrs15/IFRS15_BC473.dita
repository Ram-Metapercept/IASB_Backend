Before IFRS 15, there were no general requirements in IFRS for allocation of consideration (there were some specific requirements in an Interpretation for one type of transaction—that is, customer loyalty points). This was due in part to the lack of guidance on defining an element or unit of account for revenue. In contrast, US GAAP specified that an allocation of the consideration to multiple-elements should be made on a relative selling price basis for some industries. US GAAP also included explicit requirements for some industries on determining the selling price of an item, which required an entity to use vendor‑specific objective evidence, but it also permitted the use of estimation techniques in some cases. However, the allocation requirements in the software industry strictly prohibited allocation to individual elements unless the entity obtained vendor‑specific objective evidence for all elements of the contract. Because there was often no vendor‑specific objective evidence available for one or more undelivered elements, revenue recognition was delayed until all elements had been delivered.</p></body></paragraph>
