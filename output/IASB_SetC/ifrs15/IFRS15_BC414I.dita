In many cases, it will be clear when intellectual property has significant stand-alone functionality. If there is no significant stand‑alone functionality, the benefit to the customer might be derived substantially from the value of the intellectual property and the entity’s activities to support or maintain that value. The IASB noted, however, that an entity may need to apply judgement to determine whether the intellectual property to which the customer has rights has significant stand-alone functionality.</p></body></paragraph>
