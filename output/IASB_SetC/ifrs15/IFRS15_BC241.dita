The boards expect that in those remaining contracts in which an entity is required to account separately for the financing component, the entity and its customer will typically negotiate the contractual payment terms separately after considering factors such as inflation rates and the customer’s credit risk. Therefore, an entity should have access to sufficient information to determine the discount rate that would be used in a separate financing between the entity and the customer.</p></body></paragraph>
