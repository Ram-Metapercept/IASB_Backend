In their redeliberations, the boards noted that the proposal would result in very different accounting outcomes depending on whether a distinct good or service was included in the modification. This is because modifications that change only the price would be accounted for on a cumulative catch-up basis, whereas modifications in which a distinct good or service (no matter how small) is added to the contract at the same time as a price change would be accounted for on a prospective basis. Furthermore, the boards noted that changes in the transaction price arising from a contract modification and changes in the expectations of variable consideration are the result of different economic events—a change in the expectation of variable consideration arises from a change in a variable that was identified and agreed upon at contract inception, whereas a change in price arising from a contract modification arises from a separate and subsequent negotiation between the parties to the contract. Consequently, the boards decided that a contract modification resulting only in a change in the contract price should be accounted for in a manner that is consistent with other contract modifications. </p></body></paragraph>
