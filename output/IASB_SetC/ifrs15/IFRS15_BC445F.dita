First, the IASB expects the volume of completed contracts with unrecognised revenue at the date of transition to IFRS 15 to be significantly less than the volume of all ongoing contracts that would be included in the transition to IFRS 15. Second, for many completed contracts, the IASB does not expect the accounting under previous revenue Standards to continue for many years after transition, because the goods or services have been transferred before the transition to IFRS 15.</p></body></paragraph>
