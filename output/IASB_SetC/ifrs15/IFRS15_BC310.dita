However, the boards decided that an entity should consider only the economic benefits in the contract with the customer and, consequently, the impairment test should be based on comparing the carrying amount of the asset with the remaining amount of promised consideration in exchange for the goods or services to which the asset relates, less the remaining costs of providing those goods or services. The boards decided that for purposes of impairment testing, the entity should consider future cash flows that may be too uncertain to include in the recognition of revenue (see <xref href="IFRS15_gBC203-BC223.dita#IFRS15_gBC203_BC223" id="IFRS15_X2039" base="F35619647" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC203–BC223</xref>). The boards decided this because their objective for measuring and recognising impairments of contract acquisition and fulfilment costs is different from the measurement objective for revenue. The impairment objective is to determine whether the carrying amount of the contract acquisition and fulfilment costs asset is recoverable. Consequently, the measurement objective is consistent with other impairment methods in IFRS and US GAAP that include an assessment of customer credit risk and expectations of whether amounts of variable consideration will be received.</p></body></paragraph>
