The boards included the indicator ‘the customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset’ because of comments from respondents who disagreed with the boards’ initial proposal to eliminate considerations of the ‘risks and rewards of ownership’ from the recognition of revenue. Respondents observed that risks and rewards can be a helpful factor to consider when determining the transfer of control, as highlighted by the IASB in <xref href="../ifrs10/IFRS10_TOC.dita#IFRS10_TOC0001" base="F35619239" id="IFRS15_X1917" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 10 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Consolidated Financial Statements</ph></ph></xref>, and can often be a consequence of controlling an asset. The boards decided that adding risks and rewards as an indicator provides additional guidance, but does not change the principle of determining the transfer of goods or services on the basis of the transfer of control.</p></body></paragraph>
