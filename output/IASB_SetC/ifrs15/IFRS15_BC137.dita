This is because in some cases (for example, some real estate contracts), an asset may be standardised but may still not have an alternative use to an entity, as a result of substantive contractual restrictions that preclude the entity from readily directing the asset to another customer. If a contract precludes an entity from transferring an asset to another customer and that restriction is substantive, the entity does not have an alternative use for that asset because it is legally obliged to direct the asset to the customer. Consequently, this indicates that the customer controls the asset as it is created, because the customer has the present ability to restrict the entity from directing that asset to another customer (an entity would also need to consider whether a right to payment exists to conclude that control of the asset transfers over time as it is created, see <xref href="IFRS15_BC142.dita#IFRS15_BC142" id="IFRS15_X1903" base="F35363624" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC142–BC148</xref>). The boards observed that contractual restrictions are often relevant in real estate contracts, but might also be relevant in other types of contracts.</p></body></paragraph>
