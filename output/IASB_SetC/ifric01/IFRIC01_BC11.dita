In making that proposal, the IFRIC regarded the asset, from the time the liability for decommissioning is first incurred until the end of the asset’s useful life, as the unit of account to which decommissioning costs relate. It therefore took the view that revisions to the estimates of those costs, whether through revisions to estimated outflows of resources embodying economic benefits or revisions to the discount rate, ought to be accounted for in the same manner as the initial estimated cost. The IFRIC still sees merit in this proposal, but concluded on balance that, under current standards, full prospective capitalisation should be required for the reasons set out in <xref href="IFRIC01_BC12.dita#IFRIC01_BC12" id="IFRIC01_X0128" base="A1-108" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC12–BC18</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
