This includes individuals with global experience       at a senior level in securities market regulators, firms representing investors, international       audit networks and as preparers, users, academics and officials serving the public interest.       To achieve such a balance, Trustees should be selected after consultation with the accounting       and audit profession, the securities market and other public interest bodies, regulators,       investors, preparers, users and academics. The Trustees shall establish procedures for       inviting suggestions for appointments from these relevant organisations and for allowing       individuals to put forward their own names, including advertising vacant positions.</p></body></paragraph>
