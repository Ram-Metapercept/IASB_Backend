They expressed a high level of dissatisfaction at being prevented by SFAS 142 from recognising goodwill impairments that they knew existed at these lower levels, but which ‘disappeared’ once the lower level units were aggregated with other units containing sufficient ‘cushions’ to offset the impairment loss.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
