When developing these proposals, the IASB concluded that it was unnecessary to state explicitly that the disclosure requirements in paragraph 130 relate to assets (including goodwill) or cash-generating units, for which a material impairment loss has been recognised or reversed during the period, because all IFRSs are governed by the concept of materiality as described in <xref href="../ias01/IAS01_TOC.dita#IAS01_TOC0001" base="F24882126" id="IAS36_X0805" class="- topic/xref "><ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_number" class="- topic/ph ">IAS 1</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Presentation of Financial Statements</ph></ph></xref> (see paragraph 31 of IAS 1) and <xref href="../ias08/IAS08_TOC.dita#IAS08_TOC0001" base="F24882127" id="IAS36_X0806" class="- topic/xref "><ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_number" class="- topic/ph ">IAS 8</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors</ph></ph></xref>. Some respondents to Exposure Draft ED/2013/1 were opposed to removing this term because they thought that, by removing it, it would become unclear whether the disclosure requirements in paragraph 130 apply only when a material impairment loss has been recognised or reversed during the period. They were also concerned that the elimination of the term ‘material’ in paragraph 130 could impact the understanding of the requirements in <xref href="IAS36_131.dita#IAS36_131" base="F24882128" id="IAS36_X0807" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 131</xref> that deal with the disclosure of immaterial items on an aggregate basis.</p></body></paragraph>
