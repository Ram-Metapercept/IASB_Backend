The intention behind the proposal in Exposure Draft ED/2012/1 was to harmonise the disclosure requirements for fair value less costs of disposal and value in use by adding to paragraph 130(f) the requirement to disclose the discount rates that were used in the current and previous measurements if the recoverable amount of impaired assets, determined on the basis of fair value less costs of disposal, was measured using a present value technique. A total of 64 respondents commented on that proposal, with nearly all of those respondents supporting it. Consequently, the IASB decided to incorporate that proposal into Exposure Draft ED/2013/1, but did not request comments in response to this topic.</p></body></paragraph>
