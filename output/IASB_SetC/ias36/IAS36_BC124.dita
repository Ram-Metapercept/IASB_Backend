For example, assume a cash‑generating unit contains goodwill and an indefinite‑lived intangible, and that the indefinite‑lived intangible is assessed for impairment at the same cash‑generating unit level as goodwill. Assume also that the entity reports quarterly, has a December year‑end, and decides to test goodwill for impairment at the end of the third quarter to coincide with the completion of its annual strategic planning/budgeting process. The proposal that the annual impairment test for an indefinite‑lived intangible should be performed at the end of each annual period would mean that the entity would be required:</p> <ol outputclass="static" id="IAS36_L0139" base="SL149533" type="lower-roman" class="- topic/ol "><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(i)</li_value> <p id="IAS36_P2841" base="SL149535" class="- topic/p ">to calculate at the end of each September the recoverable amount of the cash‑generating unit, compare it with its carrying amount, and, if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, recognise an impairment loss for the unit by reducing the carrying amount of goodwill and allocating any remaining impairment loss to the other assets in the unit, including the indefinite‑lived intangible.</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(ii)</li_value> <p id="IAS36_P2842" base="SL149537" class="- topic/p ">to perform the same steps again each December to test the indefinite‑lived intangible for impairment.</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(iii)</li_value> <p id="IAS36_P2843" base="SL149539" class="- topic/p ">to perform the same steps again at any other time throughout the annual period if there is an indication that the cash‑generating unit, the goodwill or the indefinite‑lived intangible may be impaired.</p></li></ol></li></ol></body></paragraph>
