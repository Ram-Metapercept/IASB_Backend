The Board agreed with respondents that it is not clear how, in practice, this might be achieved, and that in some circumstances past actual cash flows and management’s past ability to forecast cash flows accurately might not be relevant to the development of current forecasts. However, the Board remained of the view that in developing the assumptions on which the cash flow forecasts are based, management should remain mindful of, and when appropriate make the necessary adjustments for, an entity’s actual past performance or previous history of management consistently overstating or understating cash flow forecasts.</p></body></paragraph>
