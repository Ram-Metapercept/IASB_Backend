However, the Board’s intention in revising IAS 36 was <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">not</i> to reconsider the general approach to impairment testing. Accordingly, the Board decided that it should address concerns over that general approach as part of its future re‑examination of IAS 36 in its entirety, rather than as part of its Business Combinations project.</p></body></paragraph>
