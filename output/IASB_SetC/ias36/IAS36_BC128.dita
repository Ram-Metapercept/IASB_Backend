However, the Board concluded that this would be the case only if the last recoverable amount determination exceeded the carrying amount by a substantial margin, and nothing had happened since then to make the likelihood of an impairment loss other than remote. The Board concluded that, in such circumstances, permitting a detailed calculation of the recoverable amount of an indefinite‑lived intangible to be carried forward from the preceding period for use in the current period’s impairment test would significantly reduce the costs of applying the impairment test, without compromising its integrity.</p></body></paragraph>
