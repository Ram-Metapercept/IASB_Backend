For example, some respondents and field visit participants were concerned that the proposal to allocate goodwill to such a low level would force entities to allocate goodwill arbitrarily to cash‑generating units, and therefore to develop new or additional reporting systems to perform the test. The Board confirmed that its intention was that there should be a link between the level at which goodwill is tested for impairment and the level of internal reporting that reflects the way an entity manages its operations. Therefore, except for entities that do not monitor goodwill at or below the segment level, the proposals relating to the level of the goodwill impairment test should <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">not</i> cause entities to allocate goodwill arbitrarily to cash‑generating units. Nor should they create the need for entities to develop new or additional reporting systems.</p></body></paragraph>
