Even though the vast majority of the respondents supported the proposed amendments, a few respondents believed that, when impairment losses were calculated by reference to the recoverable amount determined on the basis of fair value less costs of disposal, the amendments would result in the disclosure requirements being broader than the disclosures that would be required if the same impairment losses were calculated by reference to the recoverable amount determined on the basis of value in use. The IASB noted that it had already taken the decision to require this incremental disclosure when it first amended IAS 36 as a result of issuing <xref href="../ifrs13/IFRS13_TOC.dita#IFRS13_TOC0001" base="F24807493" id="IAS36_X0800" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 13</xref>.
