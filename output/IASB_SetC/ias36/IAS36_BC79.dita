The Board could see no justification for requiring or prohibiting the use of an expected cash flow approach, particularly given the Board’s inclination to avoid modifying the requirements in the previous version of IAS 36 for determining recoverable amount until it considers and resolves the broader measurement issues in accounting. Additionally, in relation to (d), some field visit participants said that they routinely undertake sensitivity and statistical analysis as the basis for using an expected value approach to budgeting/forecasting and strategic decision‑making.</p></body></paragraph>
