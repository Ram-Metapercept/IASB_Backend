IASC received more than 90 comment letters from over 20 countries. IASC also performed a field test of E55’s proposals. More than 20 companies from various business sectors and from 10 different countries participated in the field test. About half of the field test participants prepared their financial statements using International Accounting Standards and the other half reported using other Standards. Field test participants completed a detailed questionnaire and most of them were visited by IASC staff to discuss the results of the application of E55’s proposals to some of their assets. A brief summary of the comment letters received on E55 and the results of the field test was published in IASC <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Insight</ph></ph> in December 1997.</p></body></paragraph>
