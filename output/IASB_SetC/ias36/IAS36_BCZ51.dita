This solution may be simpler, particularly where cash flows are generated in the currency of a hyperinflationary economy (in such cases, some would prefer using a hard currency as a proxy) or in a currency other than the reporting currency. However, this solution may be misleading if the exchange rate varies for reasons other than changes in the differential between the general inflation rates in the two countries to which the currencies belong. In addition, this solution is inconsistent with the approach under <xref href="../ias29/IAS29_TOC0001.dita#IAS29_TOC0001" id="IAS36_X0692" base="F16145478" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 29 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies</ph></ph></xref>, which does not allow, if the reporting currency<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS36_FN0053" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/> is the currency of a hyperinflationary economy, translation into a hard currency as a proxy for restatement in terms of the measuring unit current at the balance sheet date.</p></body></paragraph>
