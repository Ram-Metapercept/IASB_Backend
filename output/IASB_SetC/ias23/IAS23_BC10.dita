Rather, it is to reduce differences between IFRSs and US GAAP that are capable of resolution in a relatively short time. The removal of a choice of accounting treatment and convergence in principle with US GAAP will enhance comparability. The Board acknowledges that capitalising borrowing costs does not achieve comparability between assets that are financed with borrowings and those financed with equity. However, it achieves comparability among all non‑equity financed assets, which is an improvement.</p></body></paragraph>
