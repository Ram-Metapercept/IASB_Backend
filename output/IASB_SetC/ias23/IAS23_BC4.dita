Some respondents objected to the proposal, interpreting the scope exclusion as limiting capitalisation of borrowing costs to qualifying assets measured at cost. The Board confirmed its decision not to require capitalisation of borrowing costs relating to assets that are measured at fair value.  The measurement of such assets will not be affected by the amount of borrowing costs incurred during their construction or production period. Therefore, requirements on how to account for borrowing costs are unnecessary, as <xref href="../ias41/IAS41_gB61-B62.dita#IAS41_gB61_B62" id="IAS23_X0113" base="F16142749" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs B61 and B62 of the Basis for Conclusions on IAS 41 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Agriculture</ph></ph></xref> explain. But the Board noted that the exclusion of assets measured at fair value from the requirements of IAS 23 does not prohibit an entity from presenting items in profit or loss as if borrowing costs had been capitalised on such assets before measuring them at fair value.</p></body></paragraph>
