Accordingly, the Board carefully considers the costs and benefits of any new pronouncement. In this case, the Board has not been told that preparers who elected to capitalise borrowing costs under the previous version of IAS 23 found doing so unnecessarily burdensome. In the Board’s judgement, any additional costs of capitalising an item of cost of an asset are offset by the advantage of having all entities account for that item in the same way.</p></body></paragraph>
