In those situations, IAS 12 provides no basis for determining which tax rate and tax base apply to the recovery of the carrying amount. The Board concluded that the practical way to resolve this issue was to create an exception that determines the manner of recovery of an asset within the scope of that exception.</p></body></paragraph>
