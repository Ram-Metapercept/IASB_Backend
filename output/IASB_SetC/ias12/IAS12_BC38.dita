In particular, do they give rise to a deductible temporary difference if the debt instrument’s holder expects to recover the carrying amount of the asset by use, ie continuing to hold it, and if it is probable that the issuer will pay all the contractual cash flows?

This question is relevant when taxable profit from other sources is insufficient for the utilisation of the deductible temporary differences related to debt instruments measured at fair value. In this case, an entity may only be able to recognise deferred tax assets for its deductible temporary differences if it is probable that it will collect the entire cash flows from the debt instrument and therefore recover it for more than its carrying amount.
