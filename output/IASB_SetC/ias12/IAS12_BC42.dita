Paragraphs 20 and 26(d) of IAS 12 specify that a difference between the carrying amount of an asset measured at fair value and its higher tax base gives rise to a deductible temporary difference. This is because the calculation of a temporary difference in IAS 12 is based on the premise that the entity will recover the carrying amount of an asset, and hence economic benefits will flow to the entity in future periods to the extent of the asset’s carrying amount at the end of the reporting period. In contrast, the view presented in paragraphs BC40 and BC41 is based on the assessment of the economic benefits that are expected at maturity. The Board noted that the existence of a deductible temporary difference depends solely on a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset and its tax base at the end of the reporting period, and is not affected by possible future changes in the carrying amount.</p></body></paragraph>
