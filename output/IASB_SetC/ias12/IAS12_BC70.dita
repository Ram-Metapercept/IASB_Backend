This is because application of the amendments before that date could affect only components of equity as at the beginning of the earliest comparative period. The Board concluded that entities would have sufficient information to apply the amendments to the income tax consequences of dividends that occur in comparative reporting periods and that applying the amendments in this way will enhance comparability of reporting periods.</p></body></paragraph>
