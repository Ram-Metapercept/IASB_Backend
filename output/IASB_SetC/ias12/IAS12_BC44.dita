In contrast, an entity that acquires the debt instrument described in the example illustrating paragraph 26(d) of IAS 12 for its fair value at the end of Year 2 (in the example, CU918) and continues to hold it, has to pay taxes on a gain of CU82, whereas the entity in that example will not pay any taxes on the collection of the CU1,000 of principal. The Board concluded that it was appropriate for the different tax consequences for these two holders of the same instrument to be reflected in the deferred tax accounting for the debt instrument.</p></body></paragraph>
