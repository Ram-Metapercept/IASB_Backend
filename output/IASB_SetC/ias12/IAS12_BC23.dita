Instead, the presumption is rebutted if an asset is held within a business model whose objective is to consume substantially all of the economic benefits embodied in the investment property over time, rather than through sale.  Many respondents were concerned that, because clear evidence is an ambiguous term, the requirement to gather clear evidence would have been onerous for entities that have no problem applying the existing principle in IAS 12, and could have led to abuse by entities that choose whether to gather clear evidence to achieve a favourable result. The Board chose to use the term ‘business model’ because it is already used in <xref href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_TOC.dita#IFRS09_TOC0001" base="F68304898" id="IAS12_X0636" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 9 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Financial Instruments</ph></ph></xref> and would not depend on management’s intentions for an individual asset. Many respondents were concerned that the presumption would lead to inappropriate results in some cases because it would not be rebutted if a minor scrap value would be recovered through sale. The Board also reworded the rebuttable presumption in order to respond to those concerns. The Board also made it clear that the presumption of recovery through sale cannot be rebutted if the asset is non‑depreciable because that fact implies that no part of the carrying amount of the asset would be consumed through use (see <xref href="IAS12_BC6.dita#IAS12_BC6" base="F16220584" id="IAS12_X0637" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC6</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
