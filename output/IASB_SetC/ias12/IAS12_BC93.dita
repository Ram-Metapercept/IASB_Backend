Instead, it decided to require       entities to apply the amendments for the first time by recognising deferred tax for all       temporary differences related to leases and decommissioning obligations at the beginning of       the earliest comparative period presented. It concluded that these requirements appropriately       balance expected benefits and costs. Retrospective application would require entities to       retrospectively assess whether each lease and decommissioning obligation gave rise to equal       taxable and deductible temporary differences on initial recognition, which could have occurred       a long time ago. The Board concluded that its transition approach would, therefore, make the       amendments easier and less costly to apply than a full retrospective approach, while still       achieving their objective. Such an approach also prevents any uncertainty about how the       amendments interact with the transition requirements in <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_number" class="- topic/ph "><xref href="../ifrs16/IFRS16_TOC.dita" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS         16</xref></ph></ph>.</p></body></paragraph>
