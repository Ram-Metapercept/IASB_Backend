Many also said that the proposed exception would solve the double‑counting problem partially but not completely. The Board noted that the aim of the exception was neither to link the accounting policy with measurement of deferred taxes (see <xref href="IAS12_BC7.dita#IAS12_BC7" id="IAS12_X0631" base="F16220503" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC7</xref>), nor to remove completely the double‑counting of tax effects (see <xref href="IAS12_BC15.dita#IAS12_BC15" id="IAS12_X0632" base="F16220502" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC15</xref>). The aim of this exception is to provide a practical approach when determination of the expected manner of recovery is difficult and subjective.</p></body></paragraph>
