If the recognition exemption were not applied, an entity would generally recognise a deferred tax asset and liability of the same amount for these temporary differences. The recognition of a deferred tax asset and liability of the same amount would not require an adjustment to the carrying amount of the related lease asset or lease liability; nor would it have any effect on profit or loss. Thus, the outcome the recognition exemption was designed to prevent would not occur in such situations. The Board, therefore, concluded that the recognition exemption is not generally needed if on initial recognition a transaction gives rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.</p></body></paragraph>
