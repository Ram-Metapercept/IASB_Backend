If the exception did not apply in these circumstances, deferred taxes might reflect the tax consequences of use at the acquisition date, but at a later date reflect the tax consequences of sale. The Board believes that measurement of deferred taxes at the acquisition date should be consistent with the subsequent measurement of the same deferred taxes. For the same reason, the Board concluded that the exception should not apply to investment property initially measured at fair value in a business combination if the entity subsequently uses the cost model.</p></body></paragraph>
