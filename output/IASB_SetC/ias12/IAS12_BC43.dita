This applies irrespective of whether the debt instrument’s holder expects to recover the carrying amount of the debt instrument by sale or by use, ie continuing to hold it, or whether it is probable that the issuer will pay all the contractual cash flows. Normally, the collection of the entire principal does not increase or decrease taxable profit that is reported for tax purposes, because the tax base equals the inflow of taxable economic benefits when the principal is paid. Typically, the tax base of the debt instrument is deducted either on sale or on maturity.</p></body></paragraph>
