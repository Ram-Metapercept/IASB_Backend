The IASB observed that the function of such governing bodies is to act as a fiduciary for the investors and therefore any rights given to an investee’s board of directors (or other governing body) is a pass‑through mechanism for the exercise of the investors’ rights. Thus, the governing body itself cannot be considered to have or restrict decision‑making authority over the investee. Rather it is the rights given to such a governing body by the investors and their effect on the decision‑making authority that should be considered. Consequently, a governing body is not generally viewed as a single party.</p></body></paragraph>
