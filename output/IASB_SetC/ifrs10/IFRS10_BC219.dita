For example, IFRS 7 relates only to recognised financial assets and liabilities. There is no requirement to provide disclosures related to fair value for investments in consolidated subsidiaries. Information about fair value and the methodology and inputs used for determining fair value is vital for users to make investment decisions about investment entities. Investors in an investment entity are interested in the fair value of their interest in that entity and often transact with it on a fair value basis (ie their investment in the investment entity is based on a share of the net assets of that entity). Reporting the fair value of substantially all of the net assets of an investment entity allows the investors in that entity to more easily identify the value of their share of those net assets.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
