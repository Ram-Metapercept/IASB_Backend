The Board does not think it is appropriate to consider whether there will be ‘more or less consolidation’ by applying the new proposals. However, the clarifications in relation to less than a majority of the voting rights will lead to more consolidation. In the case of what SIC‑12 referred to as special purpose entities, the Board believes that the new requirements will result in more appropriate consolidation.</p></body></paragraph>
