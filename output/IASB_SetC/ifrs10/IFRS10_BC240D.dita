In particular, this approach may better avoid some structuring issues, particularly in multi-layer groups in which different types of subsidiaries are held at different levels within the group. However, the Board decided that developing a broader principle-based approach, together with guidance to enable consistent application, would be too difficult to achieve within the limited scope of the consolidation exception clarification project. In addition, the Board decided that such an approach and related guidance could not be developed within the short time frame that was needed to provide the necessary clarification before the end of 2014.
