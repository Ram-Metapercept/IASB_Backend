The Board notes that this is partly because, in many cases, investors in an investment entity transact with it on a fair value basis (for example, on the basis of a net asset value per share, which is calculated using the fair value of the entity’s underlying investments). Similarly, the Board believes that fair value should also be used by an investment entity’s key management personnel to assess the entity’s performance and to make investing decisions. Consequently, the Board decided that, in order to meet the definition of an investment entity, an entity should demonstrate that fair value is the primary measurement attribute used to evaluate the performance of its investments, both internally and externally.</p></body></paragraph>
