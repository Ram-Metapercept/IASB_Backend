Conversely, an investor is not assumed to have the current ability to direct simply because it is actively directing the activities of an investee. For example, an investor that holds a 70 per cent voting interest in an investee (when no other relevant factors are present) has the current ability to direct the activities of the investee even if it has not exercised its right to vote. Even if the remaining 30 per cent of voting rights were held by a single party actively exercising its voting rights, that minority shareholder would not have power.</p></body></paragraph>
