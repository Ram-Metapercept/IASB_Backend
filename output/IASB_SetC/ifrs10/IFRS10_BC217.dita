IAS 27 required reporting entities to consolidate all controlled entities, regardless of the nature of the reporting entity. Respondents to ED 10 questioned the usefulness of financial statements of investment entities that consolidate investees that the investment entity controls. They pointed out that some national accounting requirements, including United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP), have historically provided industry‑specific guidance that requires investment entities to measure all of their investments, including those that they control, at fair value. The respondents argued that an investment entity holds investments for the sole purpose of capital appreciation, investment income (such as dividends or interest), or both. Users of the financial statements of these investment entities told the Board that the fair value of the investments and an understanding of how the investment entity measures the fair value of its investments is the most useful information.</p></body></paragraph>
