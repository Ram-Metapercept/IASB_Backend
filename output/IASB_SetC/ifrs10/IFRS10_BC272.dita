Some respondents questioned this proposal and suggested that at least some investment entity subsidiaries should be consolidated (for example, wholly‑owned investment entity subsidiaries that are created for legal, tax or regulatory purposes). However, the Board thinks that fair value measurement of all an investment entity’s subsidiaries (except for those subsidiaries providing investment-related services or activities) would provide the most useful information and therefore decided to retain this proposal. The Board considered requiring an investment entity to consolidate only those investment entity subsidiaries that are formed for legal, tax or regulatory purposes, but decided against this because there is no conceptual basis for distinguishing between different investment entity subsidiaries. Moreover, the Board thinks that it would be very difficult to distinguish between an investment entity subsidiary formed for a specific legal, tax or regulatory purpose and those that are set up only for other business reasons.</p></body></paragraph>
