In response to those concerns, the IASB decided to add guidance to address the reassessment of control (including a decision maker’s status as principal or agent) when there are changes in market conditions (for the reassessment of control in the context of potential voting rights see <xref href="IFRS10_BC124.dita#IFRS10_BC124" id="IFRS10_X1094" base="F16221136" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC124</xref>). The Board observed that a change in market conditions alone would not generally affect the consolidation conclusion, or the status as a principal or an agent, for two reasons. The first is that power arises from substantive rights , and assessing whether those rights are substantive includes the consideration of many factors, not only those that are affected by a change in market conditions. The second is that an investor is not required to have a particular specified level of exposure to variable returns in order to control an investee. If that were the case, fluctuations in an investor’s expected returns might result in changes in the consolidation conclusion.</p></body></paragraph>
