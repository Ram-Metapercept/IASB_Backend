They suggested that an investment entity parent should be able to apply a ‘dual-model’ of consolidation, which would allow an investment entity parent to show its directly and indirectly held investments at fair value while consolidating other activities. This is similar to the asset-based approach previously rejected by the Board (see paragraph BC226).</p></body></paragraph>
