They argued that accounting for decreases in non‑controlling interests retrospectively imposes compliance costs that are not justifiable, mainly because the requirement to account for increases prospectively reduces comparability anyway. The Board accepted those arguments and decided that prospective application would be required for all changes in ownership interests (those transitional provisions are now in <xref href="IFRS10_APPC.dita#IFRS10_APPC/IFRS10_APPC_TI" id="IFRS10_X1179" base="F16221333" class="- topic/xref ">Appendix C of IFRS 10</xref>). The revised transitional provisions will lead to increases and decreases in ownership interests being treated symmetrically and the recasting of financial statements being limited to disclosure and presentation. The recognition and measurement of previous transactions will not be changed upon transition.</p></body></paragraph>
