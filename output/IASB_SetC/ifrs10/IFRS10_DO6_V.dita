However, they believe that until the debates over the objectives of consolidated financial statements (ie what information should be provided and to whom) and the definition of the reporting entity have been settled at the conceptual level, transactions between the parent and non‑controlling interests should not be accounted for in the same manner as transactions in which the parent entity acquires its own shares and reduces its equity. In their view, non‑controlling interests cannot be considered equivalent to the ordinary ownership interests of the owners of the parent. The owners of the parent and the holders of non‑controlling interests in a subsidiary do not share the same risks and rewards in relation to the group’s operations and net assets because ownership interests in a subsidiary share only the risks and rewards associated with that subsidiary.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
