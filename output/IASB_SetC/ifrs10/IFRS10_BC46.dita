This means having the right to make decisions about the activities of an investee that could potentially be contrary to the wishes of others in every possible scenario, within the boundaries of protective rights. Therefore, for example, an investor with less than half the voting rights of an investee could not have power unless it had additional legal or contractual rights (see <xref href="IFRS10_BC101.dita#IFRS10_BC101" id="IFRS10_X1005" base="F16220630" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC101</xref>). Also, potential voting rights would not affect the assessment of control until exercised or converted because in and of themselves they do not give the holder the contractual right to direct. A consistent application of this view to ‘kick‑out’ (removal) or similar rights would suggest that a decision maker could never have power when such rights are held by others because those rights could be exercised to remove the decision maker.</p></body></paragraph>
