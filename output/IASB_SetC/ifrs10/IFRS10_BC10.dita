That Basis for Conclusions was subsequently updated to reflect amendments to the Standard. The Board has incorporated into this Basis for Conclusions material from the Basis for Conclusions on IAS 27 that discusses matters that the Board has not reconsidered. That material is contained in paragraphs denoted by numbers with the prefix BCZ. In those paragraphs cross‑references to the IFRS have been updated accordingly and minor necessary editorial changes have been made.</p></body></paragraph>
