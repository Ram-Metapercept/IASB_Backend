It noted that such a fact pattern may be common in the private equity industry. Some Board members expressed concern that allowing transactions or synergies between investments may artificially increase the fair value of each investment and, consequently, inappropriately increase the assets reported by the investment entity. However, the Board decided that trading transactions or synergies that arise between the investments of an investment entity should not be prohibited because their existence does not necessarily mean that the investment entity is receiving any returns beyond solely capital appreciation, investment income, or both.            </p></body></paragraph>
