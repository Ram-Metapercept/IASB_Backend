This is because one party or body usually has overall decision‑making responsibility for an investee (see <xref href="IFRS10_gBC85-BC92.dita#IFRS10_gBC85_BC92/IFRS10_gBC85_BC92_TI" id="IFRS10_X1051" base="F16220976" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC85</xref>). The Board believes that its conclusions in this respect will ensure that it does not create an incentive to structure investees to achieve an accounting outcome by involving multiple parties in decision‑making when there is no business rationale to do so.</p></body></paragraph>
