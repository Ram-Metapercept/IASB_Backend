As an alternative, the Board considered requiring that an investment entity’s ownership interests be in the form of equity or similar interests. However, the Board was concerned that this would put too much emphasis on the debt/equity classification in <xref href="IFRS10_TOC.dita#IFRS10_TOC0001" base="F36790166" id="IFRS10_X1248" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 32 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Financial Instruments: Presentation</ph></ph></xref> and would inappropriately exclude some structures whose ownership interests were classified as debt. Moreover, the Board was also concerned that including the ‘ownership interest’ concept as part of the definition of an investment entity would put too much emphasis on the form of the entity, rather than emphasising its business model.</p></body></paragraph>
