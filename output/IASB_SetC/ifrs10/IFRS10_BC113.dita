According to that standard, the existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible were considered when assessing control. If the options or convertible instruments that give an investor potential voting rights are currently exercisable, IAS 27 required the investor to treat those potential voting rights as if they were current voting rights. According to IAS 27, the investor had to consider all facts and circumstances except the intentions of management and the financial ability to exercise or convert such rights.</p></body></paragraph>
