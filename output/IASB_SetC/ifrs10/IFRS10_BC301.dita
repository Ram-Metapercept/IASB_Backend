Without the exception to consolidation, an investment entity could be required to consolidate an investment in one period and present it as an investment measured at fair value through profit or loss in the following period (or vice versa). This would reduce comparability between reporting periods. With the introduction of the exception to consolidation, an investment entity can report all investments at fair value, regardless of whether those investments are controlled. This will improve the comparability between reporting periods.</p></body></paragraph>
