The International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee had previously discussed this matter, but decided not to add the matter to its agenda while the business combinations project was in progress. The Board observed that the issue was outside the scope of the business combinations project. Therefore, the Board decided not to address the measurement basis of distributions to owners in the amendments to IAS 27.</p></body></paragraph>
