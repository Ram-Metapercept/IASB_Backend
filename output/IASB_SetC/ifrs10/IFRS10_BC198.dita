If, in accordance with IFRS 10, the investor never obtained control, then it would eliminate the previous consolidation from the date that it first became involved with the investee and account for that interest in accordance with other IFRSs as applicable. Alternatively, the investor may have obtained control in accordance with both IAS 27 and IFRS 10, but then later lost control in accordance with IFRS 10 but not IAS 27. In this case, the investor would cease to consolidate from the date control was lost as defined by IFRS 10. If measurement of the retained interest at the date the investor first became involved with (but did not obtain control in accordance with this IFRS), or lost control of, the investee is impracticable, the investor would apply the requirements in IFRS 10 for accounting for a loss of control at the beginning of the earliest period for which application of those requirements is practicable. The earliest period may be the current period.</p></body></paragraph>
