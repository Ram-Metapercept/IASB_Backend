Some of these respondents argued that investment entities were actively choosing to adopt those national accounting requirements rather than IFRS so that they could measure all of their investments at fair value. Respondents also pointed out that some investment entities that followed IFRS provided non-GAAP information about the fair value of all of their investments. Consequently, comparability of the financial statements of different investment entities was hindered. The Board expects the introduction of the exception to consolidation to encourage adoption of IFRS among investment entities and to eliminate the need to provide non-GAAP information about fair value. This should improve the comparability of financial statements of different investment entities.</p></body></paragraph>
