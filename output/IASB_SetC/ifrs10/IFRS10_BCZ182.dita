Some respondents disagreed with that decision. They asserted that the principles for revenue and gain recognition in the <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Framework</ph></ph> would not be satisfied for the retained interest. The Board disagreed with those respondents. Measuring the investment at fair value reflected the Board’s view that the loss of control of a subsidiary is a significant economic event. The parent‑subsidiary relationship ceases to exist and an investor‑investee relationship begins that differs significantly from the former parent‑subsidiary relationship. Therefore, the new investor‑investee relationship is recognised and measured initially at the date when control is lost.</p></body></paragraph>
