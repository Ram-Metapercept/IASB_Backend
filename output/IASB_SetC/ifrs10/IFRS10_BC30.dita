However, some noted that it can be difficult to identify an investor that has power over investees that do not require substantive continuous decision‑making. They suggested that exposure to risks and rewards should be used as a proxy for control when power is not evident. Some respondents were also concerned that applying the proposed control definition to all investees could lead to more structuring opportunities than was the case when applying the requirements in IAS 27 and SIC‑12. Others did not think that ED 10 expressed with sufficient clarity the importance of risks and rewards when assessing control.</p></body></paragraph>
