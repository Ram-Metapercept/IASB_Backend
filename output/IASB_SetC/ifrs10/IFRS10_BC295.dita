Reporting investments on more than one basis hinders comparability within the financial statements, because all investments are held by an investment entity for a similar purpose—capital appreciation, investment income, or both. In addition, some of the items consolidated would be measured at historical cost, which distorts the performance assessment of the investment entity and does not reflect the way in which the business of the entity is managed.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
