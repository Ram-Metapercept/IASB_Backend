Similarly, if the decision maker held a substantial investment in the investee (say, a 95 per cent investment), most would conclude that the decision maker uses any decision‑making authority delegated to it primarily to affect the returns it receives—the decision maker would have power for its own benefit. But at what point, between insignificant and very significant, does the decision maker change from using any decision‑making authority primarily for others to using its authority primarily for itself?</p></body></paragraph>
