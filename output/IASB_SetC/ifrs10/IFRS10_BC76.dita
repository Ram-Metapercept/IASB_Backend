SIC‑12 included this notion as one of its indicators of control and the accompanying Basis for Conclusions explained that:</p><lq class="- topic/lq "> <p id="IFRS10_P0924" base="F16128932" class="- topic/p ">SPEs [special purpose entities] frequently operate in a predetermined way so that no entity has explicit decision‑making authority over the SPE’s ongoing activities after its formation (ie they operate on ‘autopilot’). Virtually all rights, obligations, and aspects of activities that could be controlled are predefined and limited by contractual provisions specified or scheduled at inception. In these circumstances, control may exist for the sponsoring party or others with a beneficial interest, even though it may be particularly difficult to assess, because virtually all activities are predetermined. However, the predetermination of the activities of the SPE through an ‘autopilot’ mechanism often provides evidence that the ability to control has been exercised by the party making the predetermination for its own benefit at the formation of the SPE and is being perpetuated.</p></lq></body></paragraph>
