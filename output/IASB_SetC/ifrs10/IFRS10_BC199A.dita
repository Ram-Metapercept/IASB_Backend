The Board noted that the main intention when issuing IFRS 10 was to ensure consistent accounting for transactions when IFRS 10 was applied for the first time (ie 1 January 2013 for a calendar-year entity, assuming no early application). In other words, the intention was to use the date of initial application as the point at which to determine the interests that should be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 10. The Board also noted that the intention was to provide transition relief if the consolidation conclusion would be the same whether applying IAS 27/SIC‑12 or IFRS 10 at the date that IFRS 10 was applied for the first time. The Board concluded that, in those situations, the incremental benefit to users of applying IFRS 10 retrospectively would not outweigh the costs.</p></body></paragraph>
