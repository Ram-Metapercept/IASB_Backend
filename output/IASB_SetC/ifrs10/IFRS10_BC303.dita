The exception to consolidation will reduce the information about the cash flows of those subsidiaries. However, the main business purpose of an investment entity is to invest funds solely for capital appreciation, investment income, or both. The relevant cash flows relating to these activities are those of the investment entity itself. Consolidating the cash flows of a subsidiary may hinder users’ ability to predict the cash flows that may be passed on to investors. The Board therefore believes that these amendments will improve the quality of the financial information reported by an investment entity and will make that information more useful in assessing the future cash flows of the investment entity.</p></body></paragraph>
