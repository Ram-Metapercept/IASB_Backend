However, the Board believes that providing this option would be inconsistent with their view that fair value information is the most relevant information for all investment entities. Moreover, providing an option would reduce comparability between different investment entities. Consequently, the Board decided that an investment entity should be required to measure its subsidiaries at fair value through profit or loss.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
