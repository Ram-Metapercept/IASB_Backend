The Board considered whether a decision maker would always be considered an agent if the breadth of its decision‑making authority were restricted by contractual arrangements. The Board rejected such a conclusion for two reasons. First, it noted that it is rare for a parent to have unrestricted power over a subsidiary because debt providers or non‑controlling interests often have protective rights that restrict the decision‑making powers of a parent to some extent. Consequently, it would be difficult to set a particular threshold of restriction on decision‑making that would automatically lead to a conclusion that the decision maker is an agent. The second reason was that it would inappropriately lead to many investees, such as securitisation vehicles, not being classified as a controlled entity by a decision maker even though it might have significant economic interests in the investee as well as discretion in making decisions about the relevant activities of the investee. The Board observed that a decision maker can have power over an investee if it has discretion in directing the relevant activities, even if those activities are restricted when the investee is established.</p></body></paragraph>
