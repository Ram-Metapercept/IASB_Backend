For example, the Board understands that, in some cases, private equity funds may make both debt and equity investments in their investees. The debt investments may have shorter maturities than the anticipated term of the fund’s equity investment and may be held to maturity. Moreover, an investment entity may hold debt instruments to maturity to manage liquidity risk or to mitigate the risk from holding other types of more volatile investments. Although the entity does not have an exit strategy for these debt investments, it does not plan to hold them indefinitely—even if the entity does not plan to sell these investments before maturity, the vast majority of debt investments have a limited life.</p></body></paragraph>
