However, the definition of an investment entity requires that the purpose of the entity is to invest solely for capital appreciation, investment income (such as dividends, interest and rental income) or both (see paragraph B85B of IFRS 10). Consequently, an entity whose main purpose is to provide investment-related services in exchange for consideration from third parties has a business purpose that is different from the business purpose of an investment entity. This is because the entity’s main activity is earning fee income in exchange for its services. In contrast, for an entity that qualifies as an investment entity, such fee income, which could be substantial in amount, will be derived from its core investment activities, which are designed for earning capital appreciation, investment income or both.</p></body></paragraph>
