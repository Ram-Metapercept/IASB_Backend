In their view, such an approach would perpetuate problems faced in applying the guidance in IAS 27 and SIC‑12—two control models leading to inconsistent application and, therefore, potential arbitrage by varying investee‑specific characteristics. Respondents also noted that the guidance provided for structured entities should apply generally to all investees. Therefore, they suggested that there should be a single section that combines guidance on assessing control of all investees.</p></body></paragraph>
