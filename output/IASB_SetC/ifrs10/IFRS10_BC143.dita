An investor may conclude that the nature of its relationship with other parties is such that those other parties are acting on the investor’s behalf (they are ‘de facto agents’). Such a relationship need not involve a contractual arrangement, thereby creating a non‑contractual agency relationship. The Board concluded that a party is a de facto agent when the investor has, or those that direct the activities of the investor have, the ability to direct that party to act on the investor’s behalf.</p></body></paragraph>
