Such an obligation is a present obligation of the contributor, but the outflow of resources associated with it may not be probable. The IFRIC noted a parallel with the example in <xref href="../ias37/IAS37_29.dita#IAS37_29" base="F49287018" id="IFRIC05_X0116" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 29 of IAS 37</xref>, which states that ‘where an entity is jointly and severally liable for an obligation, the part of the obligation that is expected to be met by other parties is treated as a contingent liability.’ Accordingly, the IFRIC concluded that a liability would be recognised by the contributor only if it is probable that it will make additional contributions. The IFRIC noted that such a contingent liability may arise both when the contributor’s interest in the fund is accounted for as a reimbursement right and when it is accounted for in accordance with <xref href="../ias27/IAS27_TOC0001.dita#IAS27_TOC0001/IAS27_TOC0001_V3" base="F49287019" id="IFRIC05_X0117" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 27</xref>, <xref href="../ias28/IAS28_TOC.dita#IAS28_TOC0001/IAS28_TOC0001_V3" base="F49287021" id="IFRIC05_X0118" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 28</xref>, IAS 31<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRIC05_FN0021" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/> or SIC‑12.</p></body></paragraph>
