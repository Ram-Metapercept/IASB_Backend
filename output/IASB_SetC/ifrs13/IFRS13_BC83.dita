If the liability was traded as an asset, the observed price would also represent the fair value of the issuer’s liability. If there was no corresponding asset (eg as would be the case with a decommissioning liability), the fair value of the liability could be measured using a valuation technique, such as the present value of the future cash outflows that market participants would expect to incur in fulfilling the obligation.</p></body></paragraph>
