The boards concluded that even if determining the level in which to categorise a fair value measurement requires judgement, the benefits of doing so outweigh the costs. Therefore, the boards decided to require an entity to disclose the level of the fair value hierarchy in which an asset or a liability would be categorised if that asset or liability had been measured at fair value in the statement of financial position.</p></body></paragraph>
