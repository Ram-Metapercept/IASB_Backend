For example, it would be difficult to reconcile changes in fair value when an asset held for sale is recognised at its carrying amount in accordance with IFRS 5  in one period and at fair value less costs to sell in the next period. The information gained from requiring a reconciliation of changes in fair value from one period to the next is not available when requiring changes resulting from the use of different measurement bases from one period to the next.</p></body></paragraph>
