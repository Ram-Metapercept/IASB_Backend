For example, an entity might hold a large number of similar debt instruments (such as sovereign debt securities) and use matrix pricing, which does not rely exclusively on quoted prices, to measure the fair value of those instruments. In such a situation, although a Level 1 input is used to measure fair value, the fair value measurement would not be categorised within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. That is a departure from the principle that a fair value measurement should maximise the use of relevant observable inputs. However, the IASB regards this particular practical expedient as justified on cost‑benefit grounds.                   </p></body></paragraph>
