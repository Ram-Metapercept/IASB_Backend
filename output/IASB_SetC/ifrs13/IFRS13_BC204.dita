Because that refinement of the disclosure was not included in the IASB’s May 2009 exposure draft and was not required by IFRS 7, the IASB needed to expose the proposal to require the sensitivity analysis including the effect of interrelationships between unobservable inputs. That disclosure was referred to in the IASB’s re‑exposure document and the FASB’s proposed ASU in June 2010 as a <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">measurement uncertainty analysis disclosure</i>. </p></body></paragraph>
