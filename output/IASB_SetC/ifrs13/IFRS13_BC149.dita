The IASB decided that a necessary input to a valuation technique is an adjustment for risk because market participants would make such an adjustment when pricing an asset or a liability.  Therefore, including an adjustment for risk ensures that the measurement reflects an exit price for the asset or liability, ie the price that would be received in an orderly transaction to sell an asset or paid in an orderly transaction to transfer the liability at the measurement date under current market conditions.</p></body></paragraph>
