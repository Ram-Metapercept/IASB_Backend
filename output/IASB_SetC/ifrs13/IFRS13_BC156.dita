Many respondents interpreted a blockage factor as any adjustment made because of the size of an asset or a liability. In the boards’ view, there is a difference between size being a characteristic of the asset or liability and size being a characteristic of the entity’s holding. Accordingly, the boards clarified that a blockage factor encompasses the latter and is not relevant in a fair value measurement because a fair value measurement reflects the value of the asset or liability to a market participant for a particular unit of account and is not necessarily representative of the value of the entity’s entire holding.</p></body></paragraph>
