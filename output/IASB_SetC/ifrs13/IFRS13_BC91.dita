They noted that the description of present value techniques described adjustments for risk as <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">additions</i> to the discount rate, which they agreed was consistent with asset valuation, but not necessarily consistent with liability valuation in the absence of a corresponding asset. The boards reasoned that from a market participant’s perspective, compensation for the uncertainty related to a liability results in an increase to the amount that the market participant would expect to receive for assuming the obligation. If that compensation was accounted for in the discount rate, rather than in the cash flows, it would result in a reduction of the discount rate used in the fair value measurement of the liability. Therefore, the boards concluded that, all else being equal, the risk associated with an asset decreases the fair value of that asset, whereas the risk associated with a liability increases the fair value of that liability. However, the boards decided not to prescribe how an entity would adjust for the risk inherent in an asset or a liability, but to state that the objective is to ensure that the fair value measurement takes that risk into account. That can be done by adjusting the cash flows or the discount rate or by adding a risk adjustment to the present value of the expected cash flows (which is another way of adjusting the cash flows).</p></body></paragraph>
