For example, an entity might have advantages relative to the market that would make it more beneficial for the entity to fulfil the liability using its own internal resources or the counterparty might not permit the liability to be transferred to another party. However, the IASB concluded that a fair value measurement provides a market benchmark to use as a basis for assessing an entity’s advantages or disadvantages in performance or settlement relative to the market (for both assets and liabilities). Therefore, when a liability is measured at fair value, the relative efficiency of an entity in settling the liability using its own internal resources appears in profit or loss over the course of its settlement, and not before. </p></body></paragraph>
