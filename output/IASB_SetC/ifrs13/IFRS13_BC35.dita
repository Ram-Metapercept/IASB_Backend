As a consequence, the IASB thought it was too early to assess the significance of any differences that might result. With respect to liabilities, it was also not clear at that time whether entities would use different valuation techniques to measure the fair value of liabilities assumed in a business combination. In the development of IFRS 13, the IASB observed the discussions of the FASB’s Valuation Resource Group to learn from the implementation of SFAS 157 and Topic 820 in US GAAP.</p></body></paragraph>
