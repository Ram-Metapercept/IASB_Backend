Consequently, the IASB did not think it would be appropriate to require an entity to provide information when the recoverable amount is determined on the basis of fair value less costs of disposal (ie as required by IFRS 13) that is significantly different from what the entity would provide when the recoverable amount is determined on the basis of value in use.</p></body></paragraph>
