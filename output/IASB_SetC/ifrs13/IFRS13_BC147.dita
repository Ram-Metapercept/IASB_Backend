It does not preclude a change in valuation technique, provided that the change results in a measurement that is equally or more representative of fair value in the circumstances.  The exposure draft proposed requiring an entity to disclose the effect of a change in valuation technique on a fair value measurement (similar to the disclosures required by IAS 8 for a change in valuation technique).  Respondents did not support that proposal because they thought it would be difficult to determine whether a change in fair value was attributable to a change in the valuation technique used or attributable to changes in other factors (such as changes in the observability of the inputs used in the measurement).</p></body></paragraph>
