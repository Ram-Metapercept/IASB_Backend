In IAS 39 other adjustments to arrive at fair value (eg for counterparty credit risk )  were not included in the term <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">bid‑ask spread</i>. Some respondents asked whether the proposed bid‑ask guidance reflected that view. Although the boards decided not to specify what, if anything, is in a bid‑ask spread besides transaction costs, in the boards’ view the bid‑ask spread does not include adjustments for counterparty credit risk (see paragraphs BC124–BC127 for a discussion on adjustments for counterparty credit risk when measuring fair value). Therefore, an entity will need to make an assessment of what is in the bid‑ask spread for an asset or a liability when determining the point within the bid‑ask spread that is most representative of fair value in the circumstances. </p></body></paragraph>
