Consequently, the boards decided to clarify that the principal market is the market for the asset or liability that has the greatest volume or level of activity <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">for the asset or liability</i>. Because the principal market is the most liquid market for the asset or liability, that market will provide the most representative input for a fair value measurement. As a result, the boards also decided to specify that a transaction to sell an asset or to transfer a liability takes place in the principal (or most advantageous) market,  provided that the entity can access that market on the measurement date. </p></body></paragraph>
