As a result, IFRS 13 states that the fair value of a liability should not be adjusted further for the effect of a restriction on its transfer if that restriction is already included in the other inputs to the fair value measurement. However, if an entity is aware that a restriction on transfer is not already reflected in the price (or in the other inputs used in the measurement), the entity would adjust those inputs to reflect the existence of the restriction.</p></body></paragraph>
