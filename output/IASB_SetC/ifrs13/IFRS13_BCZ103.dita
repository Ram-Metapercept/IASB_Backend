It confirmed that the fair value of a financial liability with a demand feature is not less than the amount payable on demand, discounted from the first date that the amount could be required to be paid (this is now in paragraph 47 of IFRS 13). That conclusion is the same as in the original <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_number" class="- topic/ph ">IAS 32</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation</ph></ph> (issued by the IASB’s predecessor body, IASC, in 1995), which is now <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_number" class="- topic/ph ">IAS 32</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Financial Instruments: Presentation</ph></ph>. The IASB noted that in many cases, the market price observed for such financial liabilities is the price at which they are originated between the customer and the deposit‑taker—ie the demand amount. It also noted that recognising a financial liability with a demand feature at less than the demand amount would give rise to an immediate gain on the origination of such a deposit, which the IASB believes is inappropriate.</p></body></paragraph>
