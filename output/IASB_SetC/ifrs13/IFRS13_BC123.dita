The boards held discussions with several financial institutions that manage their financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of their net exposure to market risks. From those discussions, the boards concluded that when measuring fair value on the basis of an entity’s net exposure to market risks, the entity should not combine a financial asset that exposes it to a particular market risk with a financial liability that exposes it to a different market risk that does not mitigate either of the market risk exposures that the entity faces.  The boards also concluded that it is not necessary that the grouping of particular financial assets and financial liabilities results in an entity having no basis risk because the fair value measurement would take into account any basis risk. Furthermore, on the basis of their discussions with financial institutions, the boards concluded that an entity should not combine a financial asset that exposes it to a particular market risk over a particular duration  with a financial liability that exposes it to substantially the same market risk over a different duration without taking into account the fact that the entity is fully exposed to that market risk over the time period for which the market risks are not offset. If there is a time period in which a market risk is not offset, the entity may measure its net exposure to that market risk over the time period in which the market risk is offset and must measure its gross exposure to that market risk for the remaining time period (ie the time period in which the market risk is not offset).</p></body></paragraph>
