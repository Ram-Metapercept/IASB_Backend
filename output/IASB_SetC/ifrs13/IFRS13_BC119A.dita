In particular, the IASB was asked whether the scope of the portfolio exception included contracts that are accounted for as if they were financial instruments, but that do not meet the definitions of financial assets or financial liabilities in IAS 32. Examples of such a situation would be some contracts to buy or sell a non‑financial item that can be settled net in cash by another financial instrument or by exchanging financial instruments as if the contracts were financial instruments within the scope of, and accounted for in accordance with, IAS 39 or IFRS 9.</p></body></paragraph>
