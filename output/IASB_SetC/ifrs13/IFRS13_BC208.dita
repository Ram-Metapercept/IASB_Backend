The IASB decided to move that requirement from IFRS 7 to IFRS 13 so that all the fair value measurement disclosure requirements in IFRSs are in a single location. When developing IFRS 7, the IASB concluded that information about the sensitivities of fair value measurements to the main valuation assumptions would provide users of financial statements with a sense of the potential variability of the measurement. In forming that conclusion, the IASB considered the view that disclosure of sensitivities could be difficult, particularly when there are many assumptions to which the disclosure would apply and those assumptions are interdependent. However, the IASB noted that a detailed quantitative disclosure of sensitivity to all assumptions is not required (only those that could result in a significantly different estimate of fair value are required) and that the disclosure does not require the entity to reflect interdependencies between assumptions when making the disclosure.</p></body></paragraph>
