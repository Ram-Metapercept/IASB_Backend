As a result, the boards decided to specify that an entity can use the price in the market in which it normally enters into transactions, unless there is evidence that the principal market and that market are not the same. Consequently, an entity does not need to perform an exhaustive search for markets that might have more activity for the asset or liability than the market in which that entity normally enters into transactions. Thus, IFRS 13 addresses practical concerns about the costs of searching for the market with the greatest volume or level of activity for the asset or liability.</p></body></paragraph>
