That is consistent with the proposal in the exposure draft. Given that proposal, some respondents noted that in some jurisdictions entities often have common ownership (eg state‑owned enterprises or entities with cross ownership) and questioned whether transactions observed in those jurisdictions would be permitted as an input into a fair value measurement. The boards decided to clarify that the price in a related party transaction may be used as an input into a fair value measurement if the entity has evidence that the transaction was entered into at market terms. The boards concluded that this is consistent with <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_number" class="- topic/ph ">IAS 24</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Related Party Disclosures</ph></ph>. </p></body></paragraph>
