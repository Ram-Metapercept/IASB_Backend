That is the case even if an entity acquires an asset but, to protect its competitive position or for other reasons, the entity does not intend to use it actively or does not intend to use the asset in the same way as other market participants (eg if an intangible asset provides defensive value because the acquirer holds the asset to keep it from being used by competitors).  When revising IFRS 3 in 2008, the IASB decided that an entity must recognise such an asset at fair value because the intention of IFRS 3 was that assets, both tangible and intangible, should be measured at their fair values regardless of how or whether the acquirer intends to use them (see paragraph BC262 of IFRS 3). IFRS 13 sets out requirements for measuring the fair value of those assets.</p></body></paragraph>
