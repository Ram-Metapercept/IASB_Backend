Very few respondents to that proposed ASU supported the proposed disclosure, stating that it would not provide useful information and would be costly and operationally challenging.                     However, users were supportive of the proposed disclosure. The FASB decided to defer the consideration of a sensitivity analysis disclosure requirement to the joint fair value measurement project.</p></body></paragraph>
