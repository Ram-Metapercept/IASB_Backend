An entity generates cash inflows from an asset by using the asset or by selling it. Even if an entity intends to generate cash inflows from an asset by using it rather than by selling it, an exit price embodies expectations of cash flows arising from the use of the asset by selling it to a market participant that would use it in the same way. That is because a market participant buyer will pay only for the benefits it expects to generate from the use (or sale) of the asset. Thus, the IASB concluded that an exit price is always a relevant definition of fair value for assets, regardless of whether an entity intends to use an asset or sell it. </p></body></paragraph>
