For example, the fair value of a factory is linked to the value of the land on which it is situated. The fair value of the factory would be nil if the land has an alternative use that assumes the factory is demolished. The IASB concluded when developing the exposure draft that measuring the factory at nil would not provide useful information when an entity is using that factory in its operations. In particular, users would want to see depreciation on that factory so that they could assess the economic resources consumed in generating cash flows from its operation. Therefore, the exposure draft proposed requiring an entity to separate the fair value of the asset group into its current use and fair value components.</p></body></paragraph>
