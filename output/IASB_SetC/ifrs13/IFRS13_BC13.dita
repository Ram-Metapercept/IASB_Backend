Because the proposals in the exposure draft were developed using the requirements of SFAS 157, there were many similarities between them. However, some of those proposals were different from the requirements of SFAS 157 and many of them used wording that was similar, but not identical, to the wording in SFAS 157. The IASB received 160 comment letters in response to the proposals in the exposure draft. One of the most prevalent comments received was a request for the IASB and the FASB to work together to develop common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in IFRSs and US GAAP.</p></body></paragraph>
