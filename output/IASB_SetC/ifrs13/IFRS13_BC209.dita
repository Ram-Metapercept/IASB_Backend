The IASB concluded that even though there is some overlap in those disclosures, the objective of each disclosure is different: the market risk sensitivity analysis disclosure in IFRS 7 provides information about an entity’s exposure to future changes in market risks  (ie currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk), whereas the fair value measurement disclosures provide information about the sensitivity of the fair value measurement at the measurement date to changes in unobservable inputs for those fair value measurements with the greatest level of subjectivity (ie fair value measurements categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy). In addition, the market risk sensitivity analysis disclosure in IFRS 7 relates only to financial instruments (as does the quantitative sensitivity analysis disclosure in IFRS 13), whereas the narrative sensitivity analysis disclosure in IFRS 13 relates to all assets and liabilities measured at fair value.</p></body></paragraph>
