It is not necessarily the same as the price an entity paid to acquire an asset or received to incur a liability, eg if that transaction was not at arm’s length.  In discussions with interested parties, the IASB found that most people who assert that an asset or a liability should be measured using an entry price measurement basis, rather than an exit price measurement basis, would actually prefer to use the entity’s actual transaction price (or cost), not the market‑based current entry price defined above. The IASB observed that in some cases there is not an actual transaction price (eg when a group of assets is acquired but the unit of account is an individual asset, or when a biological asset regenerates) and, as a result, an assumed, or hypothetical, price must be used.</p></body></paragraph>
