The boards concluded that determining whether to recognise a day 1 gain or loss was beyond the scope of the fair value measurement project. The boards noted that the measurement basis at initial recognition of financial instruments in IFRSs and US GAAP is not always the same, and so the boards could not address comparability at this time. As a result, the boards decided that an entity would refer to relevant IFRSs for the asset or liability when determining whether to recognise those amounts. The boards concluded that if the relevant IFRS does not specify whether and, if so, where to recognise those amounts, the entity should recognise them in profit or loss. </p></body></paragraph>
