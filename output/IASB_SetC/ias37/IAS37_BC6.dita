By entering into a contract at a price       that does not fully cover the cost of the capacity used, the entity has committed itself to       using that capacity to provide goods or services at a price that would not be sustainable if       all contracts were similarly priced. The entity has effectively committed itself to making a       loss on that capacity for the life of the contract. In the Board’s view, including the cost of       the capacity used in assessing whether a contract is onerous provides information that is       relevant to users of financial statements and faithfully represents the effect of the contract       on the entity’s financial position and performance. The Board noted that an entity would       disclose additional information about the contract if such information is relevant to an       understanding of the entity’s financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
