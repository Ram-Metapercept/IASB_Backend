Instead, the entity           would be recognising its present obligation to deliver goods or provide services in           exchange for other economic benefits, measuring that obligation at an amount that includes           the cost of all the resources to be used to fulfil the obligation.</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(b)</li_value><p class="- topic/p ">paragraph 63 of IAS 37 prohibits an entity from recognising           future operating losses because such losses are not liabilities; in other words, the           entity does not have a present obligation to incur those losses. In contrast, in assessing           whether a contract is onerous, an entity determines the cost of fulfilling its present           obligation under an existing contract. Therefore, including all costs that relate directly           to a contract in assessing whether the contract is onerous does not result in an entity           recognising future operating losses.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
