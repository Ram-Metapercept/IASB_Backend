Further, a manufacturing entity that enters into contracts to supply       inventory is likely to need information about these costs to make pricing decisions.       Therefore, the entity is likely to have already the information it needs to estimate and       allocate the costs that will relate directly to contracts into which it has entered. The Board       therefore concluded that a requirement to estimate and allocate costs that relate directly to       a contract would not impose costs that outweigh the usefulness of the information       provided.</p></body></paragraph>
