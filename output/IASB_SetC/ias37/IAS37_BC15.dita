Those respondents asked the Board to clarify whether some       costs mentioned in those other IFRS Standards would be regarded as costs that relate directly       to the contract by an entity applying IAS 37. Respondents also asked the Board to provide       examples of costs that relate directly to contracts other than contracts to deliver goods or       provide services.</p></body></paragraph>
