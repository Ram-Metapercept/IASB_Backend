Many respondents to ED 9 were not clear whether parties to a joint operation that had rights to the assets should recognise a ‘right to use’ or a ‘right to a share’ or whether they should instead directly recognise ‘their share of the joint assets, classified according to the nature of the asset’. The concern raised by this uncertainty was the different accounting implications of these interpretations—ie accounting for rights or accounting for shares of assets. The Board concluded that a party to a joint operation should recognise its assets or its share of any assets in accordance with the IFRSs applicable to the particular assets.</p></body></paragraph>
