In this respect, the transaction is similar to an investment in an associate becoming an investment in a joint venture and vice versa. The Board noted that <xref href="../ias28/IAS28_24.dita#IAS28_24" id="IFRS11_X0484" base="F74058448" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 24 of IAS 28</xref> prohibits an entity from remeasuring its previously held interest in those circumstances. The Board also observed that remeasuring a previously held interest in a joint operation could conflict with the requirement in IFRS 11 for an entity to account for its assets and liabilities relating to its interest in a joint operation applying the applicable IFRSs.</p></body></paragraph>
