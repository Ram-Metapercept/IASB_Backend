The exception is when the legal form of the separate vehicle does not confer separation between the parties and the vehicle. In such a case, the Board concluded that the assessment of the rights and obligations conferred upon the parties by the legal form of that separate vehicle would be sufficient to conclude that the arrangement is a joint operation. </p></body></paragraph>
