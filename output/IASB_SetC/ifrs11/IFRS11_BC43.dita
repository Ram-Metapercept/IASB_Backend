In that respect, the Board observes that the activities that are the subject of different joint arrangements might be operationally very similar, but that the contractual terms agreed by the parties to these joint arrangements might confer on the parties very different rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to such activities. Consequently, the Board believes that the economic substance of the arrangements does not depend exclusively on whether the activities undertaken through joint arrangements are closely related to the activities undertaken by the parties on their own, or on whether the parties are closely involved in the operations of the arrangements. Instead, the economic substance of the arrangements depends on the rights and obligations assumed by the parties when carrying out such activities. It is those rights and obligations that the accounting for joint arrangements should reflect.</p></body></paragraph>
