Paragraph 23 of IFRS 10 addresses the accounting for the acquisition of an additional interest in a business that is already controlled by the acquirer. This is the analogous transaction to the acquisition of an interest in a business that is already jointly controlled by the acquirer and will continue to be jointly controlled by it. Paragraph 42 of IFRS 3 instead addresses the acquisition of an interest that results in the acquirer obtaining control over the business. This is the analogous transaction to the acquisition of an interest in a business that results in the acquirer obtaining joint control of the business. </p></body></paragraph>
