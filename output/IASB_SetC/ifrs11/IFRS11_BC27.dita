The Board thought that this possibility was likely to be rare and that the benefits of introducing an additional assessment in the classification of joint arrangements when these are not structured through separate vehicles would not outweigh the costs of increasing the complexity of the IFRS.                     This is because in the vast majority of cases, accounting for joint arrangements that are not structured through separate vehicles on a gross basis leads to the faithful representation of the parties’ rights and obligations arising from those arrangements.</p></body></paragraph>
