The Board observed that ED 9 had not been intended to change this aspect of IAS 31, where the ‘share’ is determined in accordance with the contractual arrangement. The Board concluded that the contractual arrangement generally delineates the ‘share’ or ‘part’ not only of the assets or liabilities of the parties to joint operations, but also of their ‘share’ of any revenues and expenses arising from the joint operation.</p></body></paragraph>
