In reaching that conclusion, the Board considered the views of some respondents to ED 9 who pointed out that joint control and significant influence are different. Proponents of this view argue that it is not appropriate to account for an associate and a joint venture in the same way using the equity method. Although the Board acknowledged that significant influence and joint control are different, the Board concluded that, except for specific circumstances that are addressed in IAS 28 (as amended in 2011), the equity method is the most appropriate method to account for joint ventures because it is a method that accounts for an entity’s interest in the net assets of an investee. Reconsideration of the equity method was outside the scope of the joint ventures project.</p></body></paragraph>
