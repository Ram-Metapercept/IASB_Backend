Those respondents believe that proportionate consolidation more faithfully represents the economic substance of the arrangements, and better meets the information needs of users of financial statements.              The Board acknowledged these concerns, but observed that the approach in the IFRS is consistent with its view of what constitutes the economic substance of an entity’s interests in joint arrangements, a view that it concedes may differ from that of those respondents. This seems inevitable given that, the evidence suggests that in accounting for interests in jointly controlled entities approximately half of the entities applying IFRSs use proportionate consolidation and half use the equity method. The variation in practice, which is facilitated by the option in IAS 31, is a prime motivation for developing IFRS 11 (see <xref href="IFRS11_gBC7-BC8.dita#IFRS11_gBC7_BC8" base="F16217569" id="IFRS11_X0460" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC7 and BC8</xref>). That variation will, inevitably, be a source of disagreement.</p></body></paragraph>
