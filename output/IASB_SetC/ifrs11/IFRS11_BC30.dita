The Board decided that parties to a joint arrangement that is structured through a separate vehicle should assess the classification of the arrangement by taking into consideration all facts and circumstances. The Board noted that an entity should take into consideration the legal form of the separate vehicle, the terms agreed in the contractual arrangement and, when relevant, any other facts and circumstances. </p></body></paragraph>
