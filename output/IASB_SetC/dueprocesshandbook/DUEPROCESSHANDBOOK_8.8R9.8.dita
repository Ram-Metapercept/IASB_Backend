As stated in <xref href="DUEPROCESSHANDBOOK_8.5R9.5.dita" scope="local" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 9.5</xref>, a breach of due process does not invalidate a pronouncement issued by the Board.

In such cases the DPOC or the Trustees should address the complaint as expeditiously as possible, taking into consideration the effective date of the pronouncement.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
