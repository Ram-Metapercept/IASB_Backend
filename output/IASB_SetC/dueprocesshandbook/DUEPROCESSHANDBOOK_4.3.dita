The Board normally allows a minimum of 120 days for         comment on a work plan (agenda) consultation request for information. The primary objective of         the review is to seek formal public input on the strategic direction and balance of the         Board’s work plan, including the criteria for assessing projects that may be added to the         Board’s work plan. The review could also seek views on financial reporting matters that         respondents think should be given priority by the Board, together with any proposals to         withdraw from the Board’s work plan any projects that have not proceeded as planned or for         which the prospects for progress are limited. The Board’s discussion of potential projects to         be added to or withdrawn from the work plan takes place in public Board meetings.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
