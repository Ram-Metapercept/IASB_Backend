The Board would         normally propose to develop a new IFRS Standard or to make major amendments to a Standard         only after it has published a discussion paper and considered the comments it receives from         that consultation. Publishing a discussion paper before adding a major standard-setting         project to the work plan is not a requirement. However, to proceed without a discussion         paper, the Board needs to be satisfied that it has sufficient information and understands         the problem and the potential solutions well enough. The Board might conclude that a         discussion paper is not necessary because it has sufficient input from a research paper,         request for information or other research to proceed directly to an exposure draft. The         reasons for not publishing a discussion paper need to be set out by the Board and reported         to the DPOC.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
