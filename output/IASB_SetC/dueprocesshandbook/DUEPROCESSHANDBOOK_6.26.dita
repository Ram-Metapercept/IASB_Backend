The fact that there are changes does not compel the         Board to re-expose the proposals. The Board needs to consider whether the revised proposals         include any fundamental changes on which respondents have not had the opportunity to comment         because they were not contemplated or discussed in the basis for conclusions accompanying         the exposure draft. The Board also needs to consider whether it will learn anything new by         re-exposing the proposals. If the Board is satisfied that the revised proposals respond to         the feedback received and that it is unlikely that re-exposure will reveal any new concerns,         it should proceed to finalise the proposed requirements.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
