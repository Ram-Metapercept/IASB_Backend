In         other cases, the drafting process may highlight inconsistencies between sections of an IFRS         Standard or other matters that were not discussed at a Board or Interpretations Committee         meeting. Such technical matters are usually resolved by having the technical staff prepare a         technical staff paper and taking it to a public meeting of the Board or the Interpretations         Committee as a <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">sweep issue</i>, where the matter can be resolved by a simple majority of         the Board or the Interpretations Committee.
