A         post-implementation review is an opportunity to assess the effect of the new requirements on         investors, preparers and auditors following the issuance and application of a Standard. The         review considers the issues that were important or contentious during the development of the         publication (which should be identifiable from the basis for conclusions, project summary,         feedback statement and effect analysis of the relevant Standard), as well as issues that         have come to the attention of the Board after the document was published. The Board and the         technical staff also consult stakeholders to help the Board identify areas where possible         unexpected costs or implementation problems were encountered.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
