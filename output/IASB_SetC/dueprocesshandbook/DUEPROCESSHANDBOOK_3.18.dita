A minimum         of 10 voting members present in person or by telecommunications constitutes a quorum of the         Interpretations Committee. Each voting member of the Interpretations Committee has one vote.         Members vote in accordance with their own independent views, not as representatives of any         firm, organisation or constituency with which they may be associated. Proxy voting is not         permitted by members of the Interpretations Committee.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
