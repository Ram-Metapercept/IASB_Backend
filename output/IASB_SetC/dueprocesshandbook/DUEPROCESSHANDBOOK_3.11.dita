The Chair or         Vice-Chair of the Board or the Executive Director of Technical Activities have the         discretion to withhold papers, or parts of papers, from observers if they determine that         making the material publicly available would be harmful to individual parties, for example,         if releasing that information could breach securities disclosure laws. The DPOC expects that         withholding material in such circumstances would be rare and that most papers of the Board         and the Interpretations Committee will be publicly available in their entirety.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
