When the Board has completed its deliberations, it presents its findings in a public report.         The Board may consider making minor amendments to the IFRS Standard or preparing an agenda         proposal for a broader revision of the Standard. There is no presumption that a         post-implementation review will lead to any changes to a Standard. The Board may recommend         to the DPOC that the Board should make changes to its procedures, such as how effects of a         Standard are assessed or additional steps that should be taken during the development of a         Standard.</p>     </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
