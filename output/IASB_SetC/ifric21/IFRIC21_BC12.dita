According to paragraph 14(a) of <xref href="../ias37/IAS37_TOC.dita#IAS37_TOC0001" base="F24882255" id="IFRIC21_X0065" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 37</xref>, a provision should be recognised only when an entity has a present obligation as a result of a past event. The Interpretations Committee noted that the main consequence of these requirements is that there can be only one single obligating event. The Interpretations Committee acknowledged that, in some circumstances, an obligating event can occur only if other events have occurred previously. For example, for some levies, the entity paying the levy must have undertaken an activity both in the previous and in the current periods in order to be obliged to pay the levy. The Interpretations Committee noted that the activity undertaken in the previous period is necessary, but not sufficient, to create a present obligation.</p></body></paragraph>
