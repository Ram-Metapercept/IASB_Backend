According to this example, the restoration costs that arise through the extraction of oil are recognised as a liability when the oil is extracted. The Interpretations Committee noted that in this example, the damage is directly caused by the extraction of oil, and that more damage occurs when more oil is extracted. Thus, the outcome is that the liability for damage caused over time is recognised progressively over time as the entity extracts oil and causes damage to the environment.</p></body></paragraph>
