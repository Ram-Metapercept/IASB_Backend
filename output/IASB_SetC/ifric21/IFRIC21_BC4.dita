The Interpretations Committee noted that those levies do not meet the definition of income taxes provided in <xref href="../ias12/IAS12_TOC0001.dita#IAS12_TOC0001" base="F24882211" id="IFRIC21_X0046" class="- topic/xref "><ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_number" class="- topic/ph ">IAS 12</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Income Taxes</ph></ph></xref> because they are not based on taxable profit. In two Agenda Decisions (published in March 2006 and May 2009), the Interpretations Committee (then called the IFRIC) noted that the term ‘taxable profit’ implies a notion of a net rather than a gross amount. In those Agenda Decisions, the Interpretations Committee also observed that any taxes that are not within the scope of other Standards (such as <xref href="../ias12/IAS12_TOC0001.dita#IAS12_TOC0001" base="F24882212" id="IFRIC21_X0047" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 12</xref>) are within the scope of <xref href="../ias37/IAS37_TOC.dita#IAS37_TOC0001" base="F24882213" id="IFRIC21_X0048" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 37</xref>. The Interpretations Committee further observed that <xref href="../ias37/IAS37_TOC.dita#IAS37_TOC0001" base="F24882214" id="IFRIC21_X0049" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 37</xref> contains a definition of a liability and that a provision is defined in <xref href="../ias37/IAS37_TOC.dita#IAS37_TOC0001" base="F24882215" id="IFRIC21_X0050" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 37</xref> as a liability of uncertain timing or amount. The Interpretations Committee noted that the same recognition requirements should apply to provisions to pay a levy and to liabilities to pay a levy whose timing and amount is certain. Consequently, this Interpretation also addresses the accounting for a liability to pay a levy whose timing and amount is certain. </p></body></paragraph>
