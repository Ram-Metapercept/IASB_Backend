The amendments were in response to requests from users, including those received at the Board’s <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Financial Reporting Disclosure Discussion Forum</ph></ph> in January 2013 and reflected in the resulting Feedback Statement (‘the Feedback Statement’), which was issued in May 2013. Users highlighted that understanding an entity’s cash flows is critical to their analysis and that there is a need for improved disclosures about an entity’s debt, including changes in debt during the reporting period. The Feedback Statement noted that users had been consistently asking for the Board to introduce a requirement for entities to disclose and explain a net debt reconciliation.</p></body></paragraph>
