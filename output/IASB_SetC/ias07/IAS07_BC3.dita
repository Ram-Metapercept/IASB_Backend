Some entities classified such expenditures as cash flows from operating activities and others classified them as investing activities. Examples of such expenditures are those for exploration and evaluation activities, which <xref href="../ifrs06/IFRS06_TOC.dita#IFRS06_TOC0001" base="F9043139" id="IAS07_X0324" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 6 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources</ph></ph></xref> permits to be recognised as either an asset or an expense depending on the entity’s previous accounting policies for those expenditures. Expenditures on advertising and promotional activities, staff training, and research and development could also raise the same issue.</p></body></paragraph>
