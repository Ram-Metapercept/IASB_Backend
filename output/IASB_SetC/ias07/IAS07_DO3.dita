Paragraph 44C specifies that those liabilities are liabilities for which cash flows were, or future cash flows will be, classified in the statement of cash flows as cash flows from financing activities. However, Mr Ochi thinks that specifying the scope of the disclosure requirement in this way does not capture the information that users need. This is because changes in liabilities arising from financing activities are different from the information used to assess liquidity risk management. Because IAS 7 permits an entity to classify some cash flows (such as interest payments) as either operating or financing, the understanding of what constitutes changes in liabilities arising from financing activities may vary among preparers. In Mr Ochi’s view, preparers may have a more precise understanding about what constitutes information on liquidity risk than simply understanding changes in liabilities arising from financing activities.</p></body></paragraph>
