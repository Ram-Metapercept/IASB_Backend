However, in the light of the responses, the Board decided that further work is needed before it can determine whether and how to finalise requirements arising from that proposal. The Board decided to continue that work without delaying the improvements to financial reporting that it expects will result from adding paragraphs 44A–44E to IAS 7. The Board may also, in due course, consider adding to its technical work programme a project that would look at liquidity disclosures more broadly.</p></body></paragraph>
