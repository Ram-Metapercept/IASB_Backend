In response to these comments, the Board observed that in accordance with paragraphs 4 and 8 of IAS 34, an interim financial report is a single report that includes a set of condensed financial statements and selected explanatory notes. The Board further clarified that the amendment is not extending the scope of the interim financial report, because the disclosures required in paragraph 16A(a)–(k) of IAS 34 are part of the selected explanatory notes (and therefore part of the interim financial report), even if they are presented in another statement, such as a management commentary or risk report. If they are not presented, the interim financial report would be incomplete.</p></body></paragraph>
