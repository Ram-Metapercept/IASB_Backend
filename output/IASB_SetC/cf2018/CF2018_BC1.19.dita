Nevertheless, it concluded that its reasons for describing the primary user group as the existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors of a reporting entity were still valid (see paragraph BC1.16). In addition, as explained in paragraph 1.8 of the 2018 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph>, focusing on the common information needs of the primary users does not prevent a reporting entity from including additional information that is most useful to a particular subset of primary users. Consequently, the Board concluded that no changes to the description of the primary user group were needed.</p></body></paragraph>
