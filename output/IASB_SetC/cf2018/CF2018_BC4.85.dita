Trade date accounting treats the financial asset as having already been delivered at the commitment (trade) date, instead of accounting for the purchase or sale contract as a derivative until settlement. IFRS 9 permits trade date accounting as a simple and practical method of managing and recording transactions that have only a short duration. In other words, permitting this method results from considering the cost constraint—from considering the relative costs and benefits of trade date accounting and settlement date accounting (the other method permitted by IFRS 9).</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
