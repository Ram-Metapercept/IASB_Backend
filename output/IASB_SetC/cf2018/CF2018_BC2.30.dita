The responses both to the 2013 Discussion Paper and the 2015 Exposure Draft seemed to confirm that many respondents continue to equate the word ‘reliability’ with a tolerable level of measurement uncertainty, not with the qualitative characteristic described in the 1989 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Framework</ph></ph>. Hence, the Board retained the term ‘faithful representation’ as the label for the qualitative characteristic previously called ‘reliability’. However, to address concerns that the 2010 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> did not adequately discuss the role of measurement uncertainty in financial reporting, the Board included in the 2018 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> a discussion of how measurement uncertainty affects the usefulness of financial information (see paragraphs 2.19, 2.22 and BC2.46–BC2.49). Furthermore, the 2018 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> discusses the role of measurement uncertainty in decisions about recognition and measurement (see paragraphs 5.19–5.23 and 6.60).</p></body></paragraph>
