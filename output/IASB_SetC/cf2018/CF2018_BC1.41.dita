That assessment enables users of financial statements to hold management to account for its actions. The Board’s use of the term ‘stewardship’ is consistent with the general understanding of that term: the careful and responsible management of something entrusted to one’s care.<xref keyref="footnotes/CF2018_FN0030" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/> These improvements to Chapter 1 provide increased clarity and the Board concluded that this outweighs the translation difficulties identified in 2010.</p></body></paragraph>
