For example, an obligation may arise if a minimum threshold is reached in a period (such as a minimum amount of revenue, a minimum number of employees or a minimum amount of assets) and if the reporting entity is still operating on a specified later date. In such cases, identifying which of those events (reaching the threshold or operating on the specified date) is the obligating event can be particularly difficult. If the definition of obligations encompassed only unconditional obligations (View 1 discussed in paragraph BC4.51(a)), the explicit reference to a past event would, arguably, have been redundant. That is because under View 1 the obligating event would be the event that makes the obligation unconditional. In the example given in this paragraph that event is operating on the specified later date.</p></body></paragraph>
