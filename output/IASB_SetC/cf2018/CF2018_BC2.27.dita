Some said that the Board could have better explained what reliable means rather than replacing the term. However, many respondents who made those comments assigned a different meaning to reliability from what the Board meant. In particular, many respondents’ descriptions of reliability more closely resembled the Board’s notion of verifiability than its notion of reliability. Those comments led the Board to affirm its decision to replace the term ‘reliability’ with ‘faithful representation’.</p></body></paragraph>
