However, expanding the objective of financial reporting to include maintaining financial stability could at times create conflicts between the objectives that the Board is not well-equipped to resolve. For example, some may take the view that the best way to maintain financial stability is to require entities not to report, or to delay reporting, some changes in asset or liability values. That requirement would almost certainly result in depriving investors, lenders and other creditors of information that they need. The only way to avoid conflicts would be to eliminate or de-emphasise the existing objective of providing information to investors, lenders and other creditors. The Board concluded that eliminating that objective would be inconsistent with its basic mission, which is to serve the information needs of participants in capital markets. The Board also noted that providing financial information that is relevant and faithfully represents what it purports to represent can improve usersâ€™ confidence in the information, and thus contribute to promoting financial stability.<xref keyref="footnotes/CF2018_FN0028" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/></p></body></paragraph>
