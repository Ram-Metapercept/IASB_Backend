The Board noted that the aims described in paragraph BC5.26 identify what economic phenomena need to be represented faithfully when derecognition is being considered. In the Boardâ€™s view, information about those economic phenomena is what would be relevant to users of financial statements. Therefore, the Board concluded that adding an explicit reference to relevance would not change how it would seek to achieve the two aims.</p></body></paragraph>
