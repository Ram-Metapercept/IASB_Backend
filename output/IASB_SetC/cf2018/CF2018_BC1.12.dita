It also stated that ‘major groups of investors are equity securityholders and debt securityholders’ and ‘major groups of creditors are suppliers of goods and services who extend credit, customers and employees with claims, lending institutions, individual lenders, and debt securityholders’ (paragraph 35). One difference in emphasis from the 1989 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Framework</ph></ph>, which emphasised providers of risk capital, is that Concepts Statement 1 referred to ‘both those who desire safety of investment and those who are willing to accept risk to obtain high rates of return’ (paragraph 35). However, like the 1989 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Framework</ph></ph>, Concepts Statement 1 stated that the terms investors and creditors ‘also may comprehend security analysts and advisors, brokers, lawyers, regulatory agencies, and others who advise or represent the interests of investors and creditors or who otherwise are interested in how investors and creditors are faring’ (paragraph 35).</p></body></paragraph>
