Some stakeholders stated that in some areas the Boardâ€™s proposals merely described the factors that the Board would consider in making judgements when developing Standards. They expressed the view that, as a result, the proposals did not examine fundamental concepts and were not sufficiently aspirational. The Board did not share that view. The Board viewed the <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> as a practical tool to help it to develop Standards. The Board concluded that a <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> would not fulfil this role if it described concepts without explaining the factors the Board needs to consider in making judgements when the application of concepts does not lead to a single answer, or leads to conflicting answers.</p></body></paragraph>
