For example, an entity might have a contract to sell goods to a customer and receive payment from the customer at a later date. When the entity transfers the goods to the customer, it simultaneously receives a right to receive payment from the customer. At that time, the customer receives the goods and incurs an obligation to pay for them. Each partyâ€™s combined right and obligation to exchange economic resources is satisfied at the time of the first transfer and replaced at that time by a new right (in this example to receive payment) or obligation (in this example to make payment).</p></body></paragraph>
