The Board concluded that a high level of measurement uncertainty would not necessarily preclude a measure from providing useful information about an asset or liability, so it would be difficult to set a single threshold based on measurement uncertainty that could be applied across all Standards and in all recognition events. Hence, the 2018 <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">Conceptual Framework</i> discusses measurement uncertainty as a factor that may affect whether faithful representation can be provided by recognition of an asset or liability, supported, if necessary, by explanatory information. This discussion is based on the discussion of measurement uncertainty in Chapter 2—<i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">Qualitative characteristics of useful financial information</i> (see paragraphs 2.19, 2.22 and BC2.46–BC2.49).</p></body></paragraph>
