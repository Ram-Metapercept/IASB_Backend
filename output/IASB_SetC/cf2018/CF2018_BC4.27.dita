Consequently, some stakeholders stated that the definition of an asset should include resources that produce benefits other than cash flows, for example, social or environmental services or benefits to the reporting entity, to other parties or to wider society. Similarly, the definition of a liability should, some stakeholders suggested, include obligations to transfer such benefits as well as obligations entered into for prudential or moral purposes, to meet expectations of a broader group of stakeholders or to maintain public support. However, the Board focuses currently on for-profit entities, and, therefore, concluded that the definition of an asset should continue to focus on resources that have the potential to produce economic benefits and that the definition of a liability should continue to focus on obligations to transfer an economic resource.</p></body></paragraph>
