First, it used the term ‘faithful representation’ instead of the term ‘reliability’. Second, substance over form, prudence (conservatism) and verifiability, which had been aspects of reliability in Concepts Statement 2 and the 1989 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Framework</ph></ph>, were not considered aspects of faithful representation in the 2010 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph>. References to substance over form and prudence were removed in 2010 for the reasons described in paragraphs BC2.32 and BC2.34, but they were reinstated, with clarifications, in the 2018 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph>. Since 2010, verifiability has been described as an enhancing qualitative characteristic rather than as part of this fundamental qualitative characteristic (see paragraphs 2.30–2.32).</p></body></paragraph>
