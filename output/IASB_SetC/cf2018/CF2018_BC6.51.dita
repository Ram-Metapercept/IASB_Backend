In such cases, the difference between the income or expenses included in the statement of profit or loss and the change in current value of the asset or liability is included in other comprehensive income. As discussed in paragraph 7.17, the Board would decide to require information to be provided in this way only in exceptional circumstances—and only if doing so would result in the statement of profit or loss providing more relevant information or providing a more faithful representation of the entity’s financial performance for the period.</p></body></paragraph>
