Consequently, the 2018 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> describes the historical cost of an asset as being updated to reflect the fact that part of the historical cost is no longer recoverable, that is, the carrying amount of the asset is updated to reflect impairment. Similarly, the historical cost of a liability is updated to reflect changes that result in the liability becoming onerous, that is, the consideration received to incur or take on the liability is no longer sufficient to depict the obligation to fulfil the liability. However, historical cost does not reflect changes in value of an asset that is not impaired or of a liability that is not onerous.</p></body></paragraph>
