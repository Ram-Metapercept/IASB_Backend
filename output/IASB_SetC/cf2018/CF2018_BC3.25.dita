For example, some information about a subsidiary’s assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses may be material to the financial statements of the subsidiary, but may not be material to the consolidated financial statements of the parent. The subsidiary’s own financial statements are designed to provide the primary users of its financial statements with information about the subsidiary’s assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses.</p></body></paragraph>
