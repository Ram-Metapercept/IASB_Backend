The Board discussed whether it would be appropriate to emphasise the existence, among those primary users, of different subsets of users whose information needs might differ. However, the Board concluded that requiring an entity to identify different subsets of primary users, or focusing on any special information needs and expectations those users might have, could create a tension with the definition of general purpose financial statements, which focuses on the common information needs of a wide range of users. Consequently, the Practice Statement refers to the three categories of primary users identified in the <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph>—existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors.</p></body></paragraph>
