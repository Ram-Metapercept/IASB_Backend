The Board discussed whether this step duplicates the assessment performed in Step 2 and clarified that an entity makes its materiality judgements in Step 2, but then reviews these judgements once a draft of the financial statements is available. In Step 2, an entity based its assessment on the expected financial statements as a whole, while it was still preparing its draft. In Step 4, an entity checks its assessment against the actual draft financial statements—this review may lead the entity to revisit the assessment performed in Step 2, provide additional information in the financial statements, remove immaterial information or reorganise existing information.</p></body></paragraph>
