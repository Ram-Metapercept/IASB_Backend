The Board discussed whether to broaden the audience of the Practice Statement by also addressing it to other parties involved in financial reporting, but concluded that the Practice Statement should only be addressed to those involved in the preparation of the financial statements. The Board noted, however, that the Practice Statement is also likely to help other parties, such as auditors, users of financial statements, regulators and enforcers, understand the approach an entity follows in making materiality judgements when preparing its financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
