Stakeholders largely agreed that an entity should use the requirements in IFRS Standards to identify information that primary users might need to make decisions about providing resources to the entity. When using the requirements in IFRS Standards, an entity benefits from the assessment the Board makes when developing IFRS Standards—when developing a Standard the Board identifies information it expects will meet the needs of a broad range of primary users. The Board also considered that some information not specified in IFRS Standards might be necessary to enable primary users to understand the impact of an entity’s transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. Therefore, the Board decided that the entity’s knowledge about its primary users’ common information needs should be an additional input to Step 1. On the basis of that knowledge, an entity should consider whether to include additional information not specified by IFRS Standards in its financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
