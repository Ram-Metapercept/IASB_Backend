For example, auditors usually assess materiality when making judgements about the nature, timing and extent of the work to be done to express an opinion as to whether the financial statements are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with an applicable financial reporting framework. Some respondents to the Practice Statement ED noted that preparers and auditors of financial statements assess materiality using a comparable approach—they both focus on information that could reasonably be expected to influence decisions of the users of an entity’s financial statements. The Board discussed whether to include in the Practice Statement a reference to the assessment of materiality for auditing or other purposes, but decided to focus its guidance on the preparation of financial statements only. Assessing materiality for purposes other than the preparation of financial statements is beyond the scope of this Practice Statement. Moreover, referring to different applications of the concept of materiality might cause confusion.</p></body></paragraph>
