However, some respondents to the draft amendments said selecting a cost       formula could also be viewed as making an accounting estimate. The Board observed that       paragraph 36(a) of IAS 2 already states that selecting a cost formula constitutes selecting an       accounting policy. The Board did not revisit this conclusion in the light of the 2021       amendments because it observed that entities rarely change the cost formula used to measure       inventories and, accordingly, there would be little benefit in the Board’s doing so.</p></body></paragraph>
