Accordingly, there is a risk that the effects of a change in a measurement       technique could be seen as both a change in accounting estimate and a change in accounting       policy. To avoid this risk, the Board specified in paragraph 34A that the effects of a change       in measurement technique are changes in accounting estimates unless they result from the       correction of prior period errors. </p></body></paragraph>
