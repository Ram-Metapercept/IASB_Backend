However, the Board decided to specify a narrower definition of impracticable because the fact that significant estimates are frequently required when amending comparative information presented for prior periods does not prevent reliable adjustment or correction of the comparative information. Thus, the Board decided that an inability to distinguish objectively information that both provides evidence of circumstances that existed on the date(s) as at which those amounts are to be recognised, measured or disclosed and would have been available when the financial statements for that prior period were authorised for issue from other information is the factor that prevents reliable adjustment or correction of comparative information for prior periods (see part (c) of the definition of ‘impracticable’ and <xref href="IAS08_51.dita#IAS08_51" id="IAS08_X0229" base="F15827117" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs 51 and 52</xref> of the Standard).</p></body></paragraph>
