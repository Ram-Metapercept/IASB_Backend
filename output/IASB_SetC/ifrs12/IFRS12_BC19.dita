However, the Board noted that <xref href="../ifrs03/IFRS03_TOC.dita#IFRS03_TOC0001" base="F16229510" id="IFRS12_X0449" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 3 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Business Combinations</ph></ph></xref> requires an entity to disclose information that enables users of financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effect of a business combination—ie when an entity obtains control of another business or businesses . Furthermore, if an entity’s assessment that it does not control another entity requires significant judgement, the entity will often conclude that it has either joint control of or significant influence over that other entity. The Board observed that IFRS 12 will require an entity to disclose quantitative information about its interests in joint ventures and associates, and information about its exposure to risk from its interests in unconsolidated structured entities. Therefore, the Board concluded that there was no need for a separate requirement to disclose quantitative information to help assess the accounting consequences of an entity’s decision to consolidate (or not to consolidate) another entity.</p></body></paragraph>
