The Board also decided to include guidance similar to that included in SIC‑12 to reflect the Board’s intention that the term ‘structured entity’ should capture a set of entities similar to SPEs in SIC‑12. The Board also decided to incorporate some of the attributes of a VIE included in US GAAP. In particular, a structured entity is an entity whose equity is often not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. The Board reasoned that users had requested risk disclosures relating to structured entities because being involved with such entities inherently exposes an entity to more risk than being involved with traditional operating entities. The increased risk exposure arises because, for example, the entity has restricted activities, is created to pass risks and returns arising from specified assets to investors, or there is insufficient equity to fund losses on the assets, if they arise.</p></body></paragraph>
