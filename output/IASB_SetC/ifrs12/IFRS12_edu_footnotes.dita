The Interpretations Committee noted that these views are consistent with paragraph B14(a), which states that ‘the amounts included in the IFRS financial statements of the joint venture or associate shall be adjusted to reflect adjustments made by the entity using the equity method, such as fair value adjustments made at the time of acquisition and adjustments for differences in accounting policies’.</p>       <p outputclass="keep_with_next" class="- topic/p ">The Interpretations Committee analysed the results of the outreach request performed by the staff.
