The Board believes that financial support is widely understood as a provision of resources to another entity, either directly or indirectly. In the case of implicit arrangements, the support is provided without having the contractual obligation to do so. Nonetheless, the Board decided to include some examples of financial support in IFRS 12. In order to address respondents’ concerns about distinguishing this provision of financial support from any other commercial transaction, the Board clarified that the disclosure is required when an entity has provided non‑contractual support to an unconsolidated structured entity in which it previously had or currently has an interest. </p></body></paragraph>
