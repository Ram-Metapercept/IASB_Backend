The <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Investment Entities</ph></ph> ED also gave a number of examples of ways in which an investment entity could meet that disclosure objective. Respondents generally supported the disclosure guidance. However, the Board noted that it was outside the scope of the Investment Entities project to require all investment entities to provide disclosures about their investing activities. Consequently, the Board decided to remove the disclosure objective and the examples on how to meet the objective from the final requirements. Because the Investment Entities project focuses on providing an exception to consolidation, the Board decided to limit additional disclosures to information about unconsolidated subsidiaries.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
