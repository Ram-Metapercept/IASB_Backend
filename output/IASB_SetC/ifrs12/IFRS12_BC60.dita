This decision is consistent with the Board’s decision to remove the scope exclusion in IAS 28 and IAS 31 for those entities. The Board decided that such entities that hold interests in joint ventures and associates should not be excluded from the relevant standards. Rather, they are simply permitted to use a different measurement basis (ie fair value) for their investments. </p></body></paragraph>
