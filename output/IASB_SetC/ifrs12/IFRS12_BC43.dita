Although joint control is different from significant influence, the Board concluded that the disclosure requirements for joint arrangements and associates could share a common disclosure objective—to disclose information that enables users of financial statements to evaluate the nature, extent and financial effects of an entity’s interests in joint arrangements and associates, and the nature of the risks associated with those interests. </p></body></paragraph>
