Therefore, the Board decided to require an entity to disclose information about the nature, purpose, size and activities of a structured entity and how the structured entity is financed.  The Board concluded that this requirement should provide users with sufficient information about the assets held by structured entities and the funding of those assets, without requiring specific disclosure of the assets of unconsolidated structured entities in which the entity has an interest in all circumstances. If relevant to an assessment of its exposure to risk, an entity would be required to provide additional information about the assets and funding of structured entities.</p></body></paragraph>
