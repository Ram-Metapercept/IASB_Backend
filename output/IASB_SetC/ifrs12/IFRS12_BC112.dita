Preparers generally propose having clear disclosure principles but with a limited number of prescriptive disclosure requirements. They believe that each reporting entity should be able to determine what information meets the disclosure principles on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances surrounding the entity. Users, on the other hand, prefer to have prescriptive disclosure requirements so that the information provided by preparers is comparable.</p></body></paragraph>
