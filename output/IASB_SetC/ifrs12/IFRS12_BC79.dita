The Board decided against adding ‘significant’ for a number of reasons. First, the Board noted that because the concept of materiality underpins the disclosure requirements in IFRS 12 as it does in all other IFRSs, an entity would be required to disclose only information that is material as defined and described in the <ph class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph></ph>. The Board also noted that the term ‘significant’ is not defined in IFRSs. Comments received on other projects suggest that ‘significant’ is interpreted in different ways. The Board concluded that, without defining the term, adding ‘significant’ would be of no benefit to those using IFRS 12 to prepare or audit financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
