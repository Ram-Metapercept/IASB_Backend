Therefore the Board decided to define ‘an interest in an entity’ as contractual or non‑contractual involvement that exposes the entity to variability of returns.  In addition, the Board decided to state explicitly that the disclosures about an entity’s exposure to risk should include risk that arises from previous involvement with a structured entity even if an entity no longer has any contractual involvement with the structured entity at the end of the reporting period. </p></body></paragraph>
