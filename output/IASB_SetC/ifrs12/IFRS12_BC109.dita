Information at the reporting date about total assets of unconsolidated structured entities that an entity had sponsored might be useful. However, this information would be difficult, if not impossible, for entities to provide because the entity does not control, or have an interest in, the structured entity at the reporting date. The Board also considered whether to ask for additional information when a particular triggering event occurred (for example, when a structured entity holds troubled assets). However, again, the Board rejected such an approach. Requiring additional disclosures only when the triggering event happens would probably yield information that was too late to be useful.</p></body></paragraph>
