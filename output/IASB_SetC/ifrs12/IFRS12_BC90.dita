The Board noted that the requirements are not intended to help assess the actual risk of failure or recourse to an entity. Rather, they would give a sense of the scale of the operations an entity had managed with these types of transactions and the extent of the entity’s reliance on such entities to facilitate its business. For this reason, the Board concluded that the asset information disclosed should refer not only to assets transferred by the sponsor but to all assets transferred to the structured entity during the reporting period.  The information provided would be a signpost that would enable users to identify when to ask for further information.</p></body></paragraph>
