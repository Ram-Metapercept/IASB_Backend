US GAAP defines a VIE, in essence, as an entity whose activities are not directed through voting or similar rights. In addition, the total equity at risk in a VIE is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. US GAAP contains extensive application guidance to help determine the sufficiency of the equity, including a 10 per cent equity threshold that is generally used to determine whether an entity’s equity is sufficient. The Board decided against this approach because it would introduce complicated guidance solely for disclosure purposes that was not previously in IFRSs.</p></body></paragraph>
