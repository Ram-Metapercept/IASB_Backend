In particular, the Board believes that information about the fair value of investment property, and about changes in its fair value, is highly relevant to users of financial statements. The Board believes that it is important to permit a fair value model for investment property, so that entities can report fair value information prominently. The Board tried to maintain consistency with <xref href="../ias16/IAS16_TOC.dita#IAS16_TOC0001" base="F15832910" id="IAS40_X0536" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 16</xref>, except for differences dictated by the choice of a different accounting model.</p></body></paragraph>
