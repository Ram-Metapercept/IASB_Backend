They argued that some financial institutions regard their owner‑occupied property as an integral part of their investment portfolio and treat it for management purposes in the same way as property leased to others. In the case of insurance companies, the property may be held to back policyholder liabilities. The Board believes that property used for similar purposes should be subject to the same accounting treatment. Accordingly, the Board concluded that no class of entities should use the fair value model for their owner‑occupied property.<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS40_FN0007" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/></p></variant></body></paragraph>
