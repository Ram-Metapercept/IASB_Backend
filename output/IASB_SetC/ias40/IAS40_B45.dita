In their view, the generation of independent cash flows through rental or capital appreciation distinguishes investment property from owner‑occupied property. The production or supply of goods or services (or the use of property for administrative purposes) generates cash flows that are attributable not merely to property, but also to other assets used in the production or supply process. Proponents of the fair value model for investment property argue that this distinction makes a fair value model more appropriate for investment property than for owner‑occupied property.</p></body></paragraph>
