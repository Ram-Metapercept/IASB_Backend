In their view, a fair value model may be appropriate for dealing activities, but is inappropriate where an entity has historically held rental property for many years and has no intention of selling it in the foreseeable future. They consider that holding property for long‑term rental is a service activity and the assets used in that activity should be treated in the same way as assets used to support other service activities. In their view, holding an investment in property in such cases is similar to holding “held‑to‑maturity investments”, which are measured at amortised cost under <xref href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001" base="F19805989" id="IAS40_X0550" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 39</xref>.<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS40_FN0008" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/></p></variant></body></paragraph>
