The IASB acknowledged this approach is an exception to the hedge accounting requirements in IFRS 9 because other hedge accounting requirements, including the requirements in <xref href="IFRS09_6.5.8.dita" scope="local" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs 6.5.8</xref> and <xref href="IFRS09_6.5.11.dita" scope="local" class="- topic/xref ">6.5.11 of IFRS 9</xref>, are applied to the hedging relationship in its entirety. However, in the IASB’s view, the robustness of the hedge accounting requirements is maintained because if any subgroup fails to meet the requirements in paragraph 6.6.1 of IFRS 9, the entity is required to discontinue hedge accounting for that entire hedging relationship. The IASB concluded this accounting outcome is appropriate because the basis for designating the hedged item on a group basis is that the entity is managing the designated hedge for the group as a whole.</p></body></paragraph>
