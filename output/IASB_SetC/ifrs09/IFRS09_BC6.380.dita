The IASB decided that when the entity removes the associated gain or loss that was recognised in other comprehensive income in order to include it in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability, that gain or loss should be directly applied against the carrying amount of the asset or liability. This means that it would not be a reclassification adjustment (see <xref href="../ias01/IAS01_TOC.dita#IAS01_TOC0001" base="F71871845" id="IFRS09_X3032" class="- topic/xref "><ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_number" class="- topic/ph ">IAS 1</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Presentation of Financial Statements</ph></ph></xref>) and hence would not affect other comprehensive income when removing it from equity and adding it to, or deducting it from, the asset or liability. The IASB noted that accounting for the basis adjustment as a reclassification adjustment would distort comprehensive income because the amount would affect comprehensive income twice but in different periods:</p><ol outputclass="static" base="F33207540" id="IFRS09_L0346" type="lower-alpha" class="- topic/ol "><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(a)</li_value> <p base="F33207541" id="IFRS09_P6881" class="- topic/p ">first (in other comprehensive income) in the period in which the non-financial item is recognised; and</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(b)</li_value> <p base="F33207543" id="IFRS09_P6882" class="- topic/p ">again in the later periods when the non-financial item affects profit or loss (for example, through depreciation expense or cost of sales).</p></li></ol><p base="F33207544" id="IFRS09_P6883" class="- topic/p ">The IASB also noted that presenting a basis adjustment as a reclassification adjustment would create the misleading impression that the basis adjustment was a performance event.</p></body></paragraph>
