That is because, as discussed in <xref href="IFRS09_BC4.225.dita#IFRS09_BC4_225" id="IFRS09_X2574" base="F74065317" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC4.225</xref>, such prepayment features do not introduce different contractual cash flow amounts from the contractual cash flow amounts accommodated by paragraph B4.1.11(b) of IFRS 9 (as issued in 2014); ie the loan’s prepayment amount is calculated in the same way as a prepayment amount accommodated by paragraph B4.1.11(b) of IFRS 9 (as issued in 2014). Therefore, the 2017 Negative Compensation Exposure Draft proposed an eligibility condition that was intended to capture those prepayment features that would have been accommodated by paragraph B4.1.11(b) except that a party may receive reasonable compensation for the early termination of the contract even if it is the party that chooses to terminate the contract early (or otherwise causes the early termination to occur).</p></body></paragraph>
