The requirements in <xref href="IFRS09_g5.5.1-5.5.20.dita#IFRS09_g5_5_1_5_5_20/IFRS09_g5_5_1_5_5_20_TI" id="IFRS09_X2840" base="F71859103" class="- topic/xref ">Section 5.5 of IFRS 9</xref> do not list acceptable techniques or methods for measuring the loss allowance. The IASB was concerned that listing acceptable methods might rule out other appropriate methods for measuring expected credit losses, or be interpreted as providing unconditional acceptance of a particular method even when such a measurement would result in an amount that is not consistent with the required attributes of an expected credit loss measurement. Instead, Section 5.5 of IFRS 9 sets out the objectives for the measurement of expected credit losses, allowing entities to decide the most appropriate techniques to satisfy those objectives.</p></body></paragraph>
