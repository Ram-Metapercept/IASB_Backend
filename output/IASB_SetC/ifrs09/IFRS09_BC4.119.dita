Some respondents stated that reclassifications should be reflected in the entity’s financial statements as soon as the entity’s business model for the relevant instruments changes. To do otherwise would be contradictory to the objective of reclassification—ie to reflect how the instruments are managed. However, the IASB decided that reclassifications should take effect from the beginning of the following reporting period. In the IASB’s view, entities should be prevented from choosing a reclassification date to achieve an accounting result. The IASB also noted that a change in an entity’s business model is a significant and demonstrable event; therefore, an entity will most likely disclose such an event in its financial statements in the reporting period in which the change in business model takes place.</p></body></paragraph>
