The IASB noted that a key principle underpinning the assessment of contractually linked instruments is that an entity should not be disadvantaged simply as a result of holding an investment indirectly (ie via an investment in a tranche) if the underlying pool of instruments have contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest and the tranche is not exposed to leverage or more credit risk than the credit risk of the underlying pool of financial instruments. Accordingly, in the 2012 Limited Amendments Exposure Draft, the IASB proposed to clarify that a tranche may have contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest even if:</p><ol outputclass="static" id="IFRS09_L0267" base="F33206908" type="lower-alpha" class="- topic/ol "><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P5948" base="F33206909" class="- topic/p ">the tranche is prepayable in the event that the underlying pool of financial instruments is prepaid. The IASB noted that because the underlying pool of assets must have contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest then, by extension, any prepayment features in those underlying financial assets must also be solely payments of principal and interest.</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P5949" base="F33206911" class="- topic/p ">financial assets in the underlying pool are collateralised by assets that do not meet the conditions set out in <xref href="IFRS09_B4.1.23.dita#IFRS09_B4_1_23" id="IFRS09_X2549" base="F71850763" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs B4.1.23</xref> and <xref href="IFRS09_B4.1.24.dita#IFRS09_B4_1_24" id="IFRS09_X2550" base="F71850764" class="- topic/xref ">B4.1.24 of IFRS 9</xref>. In such cases, the entity would disregard the possibility that the pool may contain the collateral in the future unless the entity acquired the instrument with the intention of controlling the collateral. The IASB noted that this is consistent with IFRS 9; ie financial assets can themselves still have contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest if they are collateralised by assets that do not have contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
