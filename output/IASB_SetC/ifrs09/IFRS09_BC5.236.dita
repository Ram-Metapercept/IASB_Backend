However, the IASB noted that if the original financial instrument has not been derecognised, the modified financial instrument is not a new financial instrument. The IASB also noted that by using such an approach the financial instrument would, by definition, not have experienced an increase in credit risk that is more than insignificant since modification. As a result, if the IASB took this approach, an entity would recognise 12‑month expected credit losses for every modified financial instrument at the point of modification.</p></body></paragraph>
