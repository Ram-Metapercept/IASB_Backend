The IASB noted in <xref href="../ifrs07/IFRS07_gBC54A-BC54A.dita#IFRS07_gBC54A_BC54A/IFRS07_gBC54A_BC54A_TI" base="F71858973" id="IFRS09_X2808" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC54A of IFRS 7</xref> the difficulty in identifying financial assets whose terms have been renegotiated for reasons other than credit reasons, especially when commercial terms of loans are often renegotiated regularly for reasons that are not related to impairment.
