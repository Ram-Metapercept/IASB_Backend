Those alternative approaches, as well as the feedback received and the IASB’s rationale for ultimately rejecting the approaches, are described in more detail in <xref href="IFRS09_gBC4.41-BC4.45.dita#IFRS09_gBC4_41_BC4_45/IFRS09_gBC4_41_BC4_45_TI" id="IFRS09_X2510" base="F71850597" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC4.41—BC4.43</xref>. The IASB believes that the fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category that was proposed in the 2012 Limited Amendments Exposure Draft, and subsequently added to IFRS 9, is different from, and significantly less complex than, those alternative approaches. For example, the alternative approaches continued to rely on the definition of ‘loans and receivables’ in IAS 39 (in addition to the assessments of the entity’s business model and the asset’s contractual cash flows). Moreover, the alternative approaches prohibited recycling and therefore did not present both fair value and amortised cost information in the financial statements. As discussed in <xref href="IFRS09_BC4.157.dita#IFRS09_BC4_157" id="IFRS09_X2511" base="F71850598" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC4.157</xref>, presenting both sets of information was an important factor in the IASB’s decision to add the fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category to IFRS 9.</p></body></paragraph>
