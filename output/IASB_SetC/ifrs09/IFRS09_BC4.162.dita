However, as discussed in <xref href="IFRS09_gBC4.140-BC4.147.dita#IFRS09_gBC4_140_BC4_147/IFRS09_gBC4_140_BC4_147_TI" id="IFRS09_X2505" base="F71850566" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC4.140</xref>, the introduction of the third measurement category and the clarifications to the hold to collect business model clarify, instead of change (narrow the scope of), the population of financial assets that were intended to be eligible to be measured at amortised cost. The clarifications to the guidance for the hold to collect business model address particular application questions raised by interested parties by reaffirming the existing principle in IFRS 9. The introduction of the fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category affects only assets that are not held in a hold to collect business model and thus would otherwise be measured at fair value through profit or loss under the requirements issued in IFRS 9 (2009).</p></body></paragraph>
