The IASB noted that under IFRS some costs of insuring risks were treated as transaction costs that were capitalised into the costs of the insured asset (for example, freight insurance paid by the buyer in accordance with <xref href="../ias02/IAS02_TOC0001.dita#IAS02_TOC0001" base="F71871892" id="IFRS09_X3045" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 2 Inventories</xref> or <xref href="../ias16/IAS16_TOC.dita#IAS16_TOC0001/IAS16_TOC0001_V2" base="F71871893" id="IFRS09_X3046" class="- topic/xref "><ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_number" class="- topic/ph ">IAS 16</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Property, Plant and Equipment</ph></ph></xref>), whereas costs of insuring some other risks were recognised as expenses over the period for which the entity was insured (for example, fire insurance for a building). Hence, the IASB considered that aligning the accounting for the time value of options with such other areas would provide more comparable results that would also be more aligned with how preparers and users of financial statements think about the issue.</p></body></paragraph>
