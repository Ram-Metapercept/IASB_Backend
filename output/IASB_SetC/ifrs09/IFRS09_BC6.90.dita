Accordingly, the IASB decided to separately deliberate on the accounting for macro hedging as part of its active agenda with the objective of issuing a Discussion Paper. The IASB noted that this would enable IFRS 9 to be completed more quickly and would enable the new ‘general’ hedge accounting requirements to be available as part of IFRS 9. The IASB also noted that during the project on accounting for macro hedging the status quo of ‘macro hedge accounting' under previous Standards would broadly be maintained so that entities would not be worse off in the meantime.</p></body></paragraph>
