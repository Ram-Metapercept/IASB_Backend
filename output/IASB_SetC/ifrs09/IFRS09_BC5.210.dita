In accordance with the general model, if the credit risk on financial instruments, for which lifetime expected credit losses have been recognised, subsequently improves so that the requirement for recognising lifetime expected credit losses is no longer met, the loss allowance should be measured at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses with a resulting gain recognised in profit or loss. Doing so would reflect the fact that the expectations of credit losses have moved back towards the initial expectations. For purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets (to which the general model does not apply (see <xref href="IFRS09_gBC5.214-BC5.220.dita#IFRS09_gBC5_214_BC5_220/IFRS09_gBC5_214_BC5_220_TI" id="IFRS09_X2775" base="F71857081" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC5.214–BC5.220</xref>), an entity would recognise a gain if credit risk improves after initial recognition, reflecting an increase in the expected cash flows.</p></body></paragraph>
