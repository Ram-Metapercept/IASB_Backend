However, there is a mismatch between the interest rate set and the duration of the interest rate period. IFRS 9 (2014) provides explicit guidance for such financial instruments so that they are, in specific circumstances, considered to have payments that are solely principal and interest cash flows despite their structure. This will allow financial instruments that are considered ‘simple’ in the relevant jurisdiction to be measured other than at fair value through profit or loss, depending on an entity’s business model. This is expected to provide relevant information for the entities that hold such financial assets.</p></body></paragraph>
