Ms McConnell could accept accounting for changes in fair value of some instruments outside profit or loss in other comprehensive income. However, that treatment should not be a free choice; criteria for that presentation should be developed. In addition, the Board decided that when those securities are sold any realised gains and losses are not ‘reclassified’ to profit or loss. That conclusion is inconsistent with the Board’s decision to report dividends received on these investments in profit or loss. Such dividends represent a return on investment or a form of ‘reclassifying’ changes in the value of the instruments.</p></body></paragraph>
