However, these estimates only use credit loss experience based on historical events to set out ‘provisioning’ levels over the entire economic cycle (‘through-the-cycle’). Furthermore, through-the-cycle approaches consider a range of possible economic outcomes instead of those that are actually expected at the reporting date. This would result in a loss allowance that is not designed to reflect the economic characteristics of the financial instruments at the reporting date. In addition, the default measures used may be adjusted to reflect a more ‘conservative’ outlook instead of actual expectations.</p></body></paragraph>
