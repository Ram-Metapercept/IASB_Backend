This is because amortised cost information is presented in profit or loss for assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and, as the IASB has consistently stated, the amortised cost measurement attribute provides relevant and useful information only for financial assets with ‘simple’ contractual cash flows (ie contractual cash flows that are solely principal and interest). Amortised cost is a relatively simple measurement technique that allocates interest over the relevant time period using the effective interest rate. As discussed in <xref href="IFRS09_BC4.23.dita#IFRS09_BC4_23" id="IFRS09_X2501" base="F71850560" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC4.23</xref>, the IASB’s long-held view is that the effective interest method, which underpins amortised cost measurement, is not an appropriate method for allocating ‘complex’ contractual cash flows (ie contractual cash flows that are not solely principal and interest).</p></body></paragraph>
