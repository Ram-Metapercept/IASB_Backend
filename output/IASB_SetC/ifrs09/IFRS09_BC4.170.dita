A financial asset was measured at amortised cost only if its contractual terms gave rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, subject to the assessment of the business model within which the asset is held. For the purposes of assessing the contractual cash flow characteristics of a financial asset, interest was consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time. <xref href="IFRS09_BC4.22.dita#IFRS09_BC4_22" id="IFRS09_X2518" base="F71850599" class="- topic/xref ">Paragraph BC4.22</xref> noted that a premium for liquidity risk may be included.</p></body></paragraph>
