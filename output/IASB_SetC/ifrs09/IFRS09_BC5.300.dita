For example, a fallback provision could specify the hierarchy of rates to which an interest rate benchmark would revert in case the existing benchmark rate ceases to exist. The IASB decided these situations—ie revisions to an entity’s estimates of future cash payments or receipts arising from the activation of existing contractual terms that are required by the reform—should also be within the scope of the Phase 2 amendments.  Doing so, avoids differences in accounting outcomes simply because the changes in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows were triggered by an existing contractual term instead of by a change in the contractual cash flows or contractual terms after the initial recognition of the financial instrument. Such diversity in accounting outcomes would reduce the usefulness of information provided to users of financial statements and would be burdensome to preparers.</p></body></paragraph>
