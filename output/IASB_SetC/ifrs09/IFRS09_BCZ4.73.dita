The latter is intended to provide information about the financial position, performance and changes in financial position of an entity that is useful to a wide range of users                     in making economic decisions. However, the IASB acknowledged that for the purposes of determining what level of capital an institution should maintain, prudential supervisors may wish to understand the circumstances in which a regulated financial institution has chosen to apply the fair value option and evaluate the rigour of the institution’s fair value measurement practices and the robustness of its underlying risk management strategies, policies and practices. Furthermore, the IASB agreed that certain disclosures would assist both prudential supervisors in their evaluation of capital requirements and investors in making economic decisions. In particular, the IASB decided to require an entity to disclose how it has satisfied the conditions for using the fair value option, including, for instruments that are now within <xref href="IFRS09_g4.2.2-4.2.2.dita#IFRS09_g4_2_2_4_2_2/IFRS09_g4_2_2_4_2_2_TI" base="F71919245" id="IFRS09_X2391" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 4.2.2(b) of IFRS 9</xref>, a narrative description of how designation at fair value through profit or loss is consistent with the entity’s documented risk management or investment strategy.</p></body></paragraph>
