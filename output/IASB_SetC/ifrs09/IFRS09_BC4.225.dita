That is, the loan’s prepayment amount is calculated in the same way as a prepayment amount accommodated by paragraph B4.1.11(b) of IFRS 9 (as issued in 2014). Specifically, the loan’s prepayment amount reflects unpaid amounts of principal and interest plus or minus an amount that reflects the effect of the change in the relevant benchmark interest rate. The contractual terms of the loan described in paragraph BC4.224 change only the circumstances in which the compensation amounts may arise; ie the loan may result in either reasonable additional compensation or reasonable negative compensation for the early termination of the contract.</p></body></paragraph>
