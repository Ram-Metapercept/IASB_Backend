As a result of the reform, contractual cash flows of hedged items and hedging       instruments based on an existing interest rate benchmark will likely change when that interest       rate benchmark is subject to the reformâ€”in these amendments, contractual cash flows encompass       both contractually specified and non-contractually specified cash flows. The same uncertainty       arising from the reform regarding the timing and the amount of future cash flows will likely       affect the changes in fair value of hedged items and hedging instruments in a fair value hedge       of the interest rate benchmark exposure. Until decisions are made about what the alternative       benchmark rate is, and when and how the reform will occur, including specifying its effects on       particular contracts, uncertainties will exist regarding the timing and the amount of future       cash flows of the hedged item and the hedging instrument.</p></body></paragraph>
