This is because currently in IAS 39 forbearance, as             generally used in the regulatory sense, is regarded as an event that indicates objective             evidence of impairment. The IASB however notes that because a significant increase in             credit risk is determined by reference to the initial credit risk (on the original             contractual terms), financial instruments will not necessarily revert to 12‑month             expected credit losses as a result of a modification of contractual cash flows. IFRS 9             requires an entity to base its assessment of significant increases in credit risk on the             credit risk at initial recognition of the original financial instrument (assuming             derecognition has not occurred), based on all reasonable and supportable information             that is available without undue cost or effort. This includes historical, current and             forward‑looking information and an assessment of the credit risk over the remaining life             of the instrument, which should include the circumstances that led to the             modification.</p></body></paragraph>
