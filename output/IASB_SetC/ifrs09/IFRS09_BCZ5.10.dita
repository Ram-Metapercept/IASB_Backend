The IASB concluded that an entity may recognise a gain or loss at inception only if fair value is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument (ie without modification or repackaging) or is based on a valuation technique incorporating only observable market data. The IASB concluded that those conditions were necessary and sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that fair value was other than the transaction price for the purpose of recognising upfront gains or losses. The IASB decided that in other cases, the transaction price gave the best evidence of fair value.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS09_FN0117" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/> The IASB also noted that its decision achieved convergence with US GAAP.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS09_FN0118" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/> </p></body></paragraph>
