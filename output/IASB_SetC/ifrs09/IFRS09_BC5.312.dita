For example, a change would be economically equivalent if it involved only replacing an interest rate benchmark with an alternative benchmark rate plus a fixed spread that compensated for the basis difference between the interest rate benchmark and the alternative benchmark rate. The IASB observed that, in this situation, applying <xref href="IFRS09_B5.4.5.dita" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph B5.4.5 of IFRS 9</xref> (that is, revising the effective interest rate when cash flows are re-estimated) would have an accounting outcome similar to applying <xref href="IFRS09_5.4.3.dita" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 5.4.3</xref> or <xref href="IFRS09_B5.4.6.dita" class="- topic/xref ">B5.4.6 of IFRS 9</xref> (that is, recognising a modification gain or loss) because it is unlikely that the resulting modification gain or loss would be significant.</p></body></paragraph>
