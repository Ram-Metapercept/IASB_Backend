For example, this scenario may arise when an entity sells an item (for example, an automobile) and, as a marketing incentive, provides financing to the customer at an interest rate that is below the prevailing market rate. At initial recognition the entity would measure the financial asset at fair value<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS09_FN0110" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/> and, as a result of the below‑market interest rate, the fair value would be at a discount to the par amount. If the customer has a contractual right to repay the par amount at any point before maturity, then without an exception, the contractual cash flows may not be solely payments of principal and interest. The IASB observed that such a contractual prepayment feature likely would have an insignificant fair value because it is unlikely that the customer will choose to prepay; in particular, because the interest rate is below‑market and thus the financing is advantageous. Consistently with the discussion in <xref href="IFRS09_BC4.193.dita#IFRS09_BC4_193" base="F71850684" id="IFRS09_X2533" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC4.193</xref>, the IASB believes that amortised cost would provide relevant                     and useful information to users of financial statements about this financial asset, because the prepayment amount does not introduce variability that is inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement.</p></body></paragraph>
