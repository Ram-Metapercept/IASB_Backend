The IASB also noted that extending the eligibility to these financial instruments would align the new hedge accounting model more closely with the classification model of IFRS 9 and make it better able to address hedging strategies that could evolve in the future. Consequently, the IASB proposed in its 2010 Hedge Accounting Exposure Draft that non-derivative financial instruments that are measured at fair value through profit or loss should also be eligible hedging instruments if they are designated in their entirety (in addition to hedges of foreign currency risk for which the hedging instrument can be designated on a risk component basis—see <xref href="IFRS09_BC6.124.dita#IFRS09_BC6_124" id="IFRS09_X2895" base="F71859350" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC6.124</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
