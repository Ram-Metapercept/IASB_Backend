Such a prepayment amount would, in effect, include an amount that reflects a payment <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">to</i> the borrower from the lender, instead of compensation <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">from</i> the borrower to the lender, even though the borrower chose to prepay the debt instrument. An outcome in which the party choosing to terminate the contract receives an amount, instead of pays an amount, is inconsistent with paragraph B4.1.11(b) of IFRS 9 (as issued in 2014). Specifically, it is inconsistent with the notion of reasonable additional compensation for the early termination of the contract. In this section of the Basis for Conclusions, such an outcome is referred to as negative compensation. Thus, the financial assets described in the submission would not have contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest, and those instruments would be measured at fair value through profit or loss applying IFRS 9 (as issued in 2014).</p></body></paragraph>
