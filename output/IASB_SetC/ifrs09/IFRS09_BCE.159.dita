However, the IASB clarified that IFRS 9 does not require individual financial instruments to be identifiable as having significantly increased in credit risk in order to recognise lifetime expected credit losses. Financial instruments that share common risk characteristics can be assessed on a collective basis. In particular, IFRS 9 clarifies that the assessment of significant increases in credit risk could be implemented by establishing the maximum credit risk accepted for a particular portfolio on initial recognition (by product type and/or region; the ‘origination’ credit risk), and then comparing the credit risk of financial instruments in that portfolio at the reporting date with that origination credit risk.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS09_FN0146" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/> In addition, it clarifies that in some cases the assessment of significant increases in credit risk can be implemented through a counterparty assessment instead of an assessment of each individual facility provided to the counterparty as long as such an assessment achieves the objectives of the impairment model and the outcome would not be different to what it would have been if financial instruments had been individually assessed.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS09_FN0147" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/> Both of these clarifications are expected to reduce the operational burden of tracking.</p></body></paragraph>
