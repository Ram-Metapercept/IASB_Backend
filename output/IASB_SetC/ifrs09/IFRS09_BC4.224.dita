However, the difference is that such a prepayment feature may have the result that the party that triggers the early termination of the contract may, in effect, receive an amount <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">from</i> the other party, rather than pay compensation <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">to</i> the other party. To illustrate this difference, the IASB considered a loan with a prepayment feature that may result in negative compensation. Specifically, both the borrower and the lender have the option to terminate the loan before maturity and, if the loan is terminated early, the prepayment amount includes compensation that reflects the change in the relevant benchmark interest rate. That is, if the loan is terminated early (by either party) and the relevant benchmark interest rate has fallen since the loan was initially recognised, then the lender will effectively receive an amount representing the present value of that lost interest revenue over the loan’s remaining term. Conversely, if the contract is terminated early (by either party) and the relevant benchmark interest rate has risen, then the borrower will effectively receive an amount that represents the effect of that change in that interest rate over the loan’s remaining term.</p></body></paragraph>
