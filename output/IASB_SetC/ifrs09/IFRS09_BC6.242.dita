More specifically, those respondents were concerned that the objective of the hedge effectiveness assessment as drafted in the 2010 Hedge Accounting Exposure Draft could be interpreted as requiring entities to set up a hedging relationship that was ‘perfectly effective’. They were concerned that this would result in an effectiveness assessment that would be based on a bright line of 100 per cent effectiveness, and that such an approach:</p><ol outputclass="static" base="F33207070" id="IFRS09_L0326" type="lower-alpha" class="- topic/ol "><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(a)</li_value> <p base="F33207071" id="IFRS09_P6681" class="- topic/p ">would not take into account that, in many situations, entities do not use a hedging instrument that would make the hedging relationship ‘perfectly effective’.
