Some respondents argued that the inconsistencies that the IASB had discussed in its original deliberations (see <xref href="IFRS09_BC6.107.dita#IFRS09_BC6_107" id="IFRS09_X2876" base="F71859269" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC6.107–BC6.108</xref>) could be overcome by using a differentiating approach, whereby if fair value changes of the hedging instrument exceeded those of the hedged item hedge ineffectiveness would be presented in profit or loss and otherwise in other comprehensive income. However, the IASB noted that the cumulative ineffectiveness presented in profit or loss or other comprehensive income over the total period of the hedging relationship might still contradict the principle of not recycling to profit or loss changes in the fair value of equity investments at fair value through other comprehensive income. Hence, the IASB rejected that approach.</p></body></paragraph>
