Therefore, an entity is required to amend the hedging relationship to reflect the changes required by the reform as and when the uncertainty arising from the reform is no longer present with respect to the hedged risk or the timing and the amount of interest rate benchmark-based cash flows of the hedged item or of the hedging instrument. The scope of the hedging relationships to which the Phase 2 amendments apply is therefore the same as the scope to which the Phase 1 amendments apply, except for the amendment to the separately identifiable requirement, which also applies to the designation of new hedging relationships (see <xref href="IFRS09_6.9.13.dita" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 6.9.13 of IFRS 9</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
