However, the IASB concluded that an entity is likely to have such information available because IFRS 9 already requires it to identify and document hedged items designated within a hedging relationship with sufficient specificity. Therefore, the IASB concluded that the benefits of avoiding the discontinuation of hedge accounting and the resulting accounting impacts outweigh the associated costs of this exception.</p></body></paragraph>
