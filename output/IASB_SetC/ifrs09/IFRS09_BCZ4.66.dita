However, the IASB noted that users, in making economic decisions, would find useful both a description of the chosen strategy and how designation at fair value through profit or loss is consistent with it. Such disclosures are required (now in <xref href="../ifrs07/IFRS07_TOC.dita#IFRS07_TOC0001/IFRS07_TOC0001_V2" base="F71850010" id="IFRS09_X2382" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 7</xref>). The IASB also noted that the required documentation of the entity’s strategy need not be item by item, nor need it be in the level of detail required for hedge accounting. However, it should be sufficient to demonstrate that using the fair value option is consistent with the entity’s risk management or investment strategy. In many cases, the entity’s existing documentation, as approved by its key management personnel, should be sufficient for this purpose. </p></body></paragraph>
