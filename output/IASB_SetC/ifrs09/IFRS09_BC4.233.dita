Accordingly, in the deliberations that led to the publication of the 2017 Negative Compensation Exposure Draft, the IASB observed that if such a prepayable financial asset is measured at amortised cost, the likelihood is higher that the lender will be required to make catch-up adjustments applying <xref href="IFRS09_B5.4.6.dita#IFRS09_B5_4_6" id="IFRS09_X2578" base="F74065321" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph B5.4.6 of IFRS 9</xref> to reflect revisions to its estimates of contractual cash flows related to the exercise of the prepayment feature. This could include adjustments to reflect circumstances in which the lender is forced to settle the contract in a way that it would not recover its investment for reasons other than the asset’s credit quality. The IASB observed that recognising frequent upward and downward adjustments in the gross carrying amount is generally inconsistent with the objective of the effective interest method, which is a relatively simple measurement technique that allocates interest using the effective interest rate over the relevant time period. Recognising more frequent adjustments in the gross carrying amount could reduce the usefulness of the interest amounts that are calculated using such a simple measurement technique and could suggest that fair value measurement would provide more useful information.</p></body></paragraph>
