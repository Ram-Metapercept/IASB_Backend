The IASB considered whether specific transition requirements are needed for those entities because, without such additional transition requirements, the transition provisions in Section 7.2 of IFRS 9 (as issued in 2014) would not be applicable. That is because, as set out in paragraph 7.2.27 of IFRS 9, an entity applies each of the transition provisions in IFRS 9 only once; ie at the relevant date of initial application of IFRS 9. This means that entities would be required to apply the amendments retrospectively applying IAS 8 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors</ph></ph>. However, in some circumstances, an entity may not be able to apply the amendments retrospectively without the use of hindsight. When the IASB developed the transition requirements in IFRS 9, it provided requirements to address scenarios when it would be impracticable to apply particular requirements retrospectively. Accordingly, the IASB decided to provide transition requirements for entities that apply the amendments after they have already applied IFRS 9.</p></body></paragraph>
