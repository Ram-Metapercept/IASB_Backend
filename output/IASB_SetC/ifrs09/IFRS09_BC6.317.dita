Under <xref href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001/IAS39_TOC0001_V3" base="F71871707" id="IFRS09_X3003" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 39</xref> this had resulted in discontinuing hedge accounting for the hedging relationship as designated, ie the volume designated as the hedged item in its entirety. The IASB considered that the quantity of forecast transactions that were still highly probable of occurring was in fact a continuation of the original hedging relationship (albeit with a lower volume). Hence, the IASB decided to propose in its 2010 Hedge Accounting Exposure Draft that hedge accounting should be discontinued only for the volume that was no longer highly probable of occurring and that the remaining volume that was still highly probable of occurring should be accounted for as a continuation of the original hedging relationship. In the IASB’s view, this would more closely align hedge accounting with risk management and provide more useful information.</p></body></paragraph>
