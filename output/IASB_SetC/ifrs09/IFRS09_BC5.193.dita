The IASB clarified that the objective of the rebuttable presumption in <xref href="IFRS09_5.5.11.dita#IFRS09_5_5_11" id="IFRS09_X2764" base="F71857036" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 5.5.11 of IFRS 9</xref> is not to be an absolute indicator of when lifetime expected credit losses should be recognised, but serves as a backstop for when there has been a significant increase in credit risk. The IASB noted that the application of the rebuttable presumption should identify significant increases in credit risk before financial assets become credit‑impaired or an actual default occurs. The IASB also noted that, ideally, significant increases in credit risk should be identified before financial assets become past due.</p></body></paragraph>
