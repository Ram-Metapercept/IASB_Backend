However, some respondents expressed the view that the scope of the exceptions,       as set out in the 2019 Exposure Draft, would not include other types of hedging relationships       that may be affected by uncertainties arising from the reform such as hedging relationships in       which an entity designates cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to both       foreign currency and interest rate risk. These respondents asked the IASB to clarify whether       the scope of the exceptions was meant to include such hedging relationships.</p></body></paragraph>
