However, the acquisition of an interest in an associate represents the acquisition of a financial instrument. The acquisition of an interest in an associate does not represent an acquisition of a business with subsequent consolidation of the constituent net assets. The IASB noted that paragraph 20 of IAS 28 explains only the methodology used to account for investments in associates. This should not be taken to imply that the principles for business combinations and consolidations can be applied by analogy to accounting for investments in associates and joint ventures. The IASB concluded that <xref href="IFRS09_g2.1-2.7.dita#IFRS09_g2_1_2_7/IFRS09_g2_1_2_7_TI" id="IFRS09_X2251" base="F71919203" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 2(g)</xref> should not be applied by analogy to contracts to acquire investments in associates and similar transactions.
