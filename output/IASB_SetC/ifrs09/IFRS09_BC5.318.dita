If there are changes in addition to those required by the reform, an entity would first apply the practical expedient in <xref href="IFRS09_5.4.7.dita" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 5.4.7 of IFRS 9</xref> to account for the changes to the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or financial liability determined to be required by the reform (ie changes that meet the conditions in paragraph 5.4.7 of IFRS 9) by updating the effective interest rate based on the alternative benchmark rate. Then the entity would apply the relevant requirements in IFRS 9 to determine if the additional changes to that financial instrument (ie any changes to which the practical expedient does not apply) result in the derecognition of the financial instrument. If the entity determines that the additional changes do not result in derecognition of that financial asset or financial liability, the entity would account for the additional changes (ie changes not required by the reform) by applying <xref href="IFRS09_5.4.3.dita" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 5.4.3</xref> or <xref href="IFRS09_B5.4.6.dita" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph B5.4.6 of IFRS 9</xref>. In the IASB’s view, this approach would provide useful information to users of financial statements about the economic effects of any changes to financial instruments not required by the reform while consistently accounting for changes required by the reform.</p></body></paragraph>
