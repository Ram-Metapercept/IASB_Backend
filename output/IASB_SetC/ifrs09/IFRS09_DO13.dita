The Board concludes that reporting fair value changes in profit or loss may not reflect the operating performance of an entity. Mr Leisenring could accept accounting for changes in fair value of some instruments outside profit or loss in other comprehensive income. That accounting, however, should not be a free choice and why that presentation is superior in defined circumstances should be developed. In addition, when these securities are sold any realised gains and losses are not ‘recycled’ to profit or loss. That conclusion is inconsistent with the Board’s conclusion that dividends received on these instruments should be reported in profit or loss. Such dividends would represent a return on investment or a form of ‘recycling’ of changes in the value of the instruments.</p></body></paragraph>
