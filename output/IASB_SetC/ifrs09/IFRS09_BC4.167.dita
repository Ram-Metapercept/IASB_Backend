The approach was a ‘business-activity approach’ and was similar to the tentative approach that the FASB had been considering immediately prior to the start of the boards’ joint deliberations. In summary, the business-activity approach would have classified financial assets on the basis of the business activity that the entity uses in acquiring and managing those financial assets, subject to an assessment of the asset’s contractual cash flow characteristics. The business-activity approach focused on the strategy that resulted in an entity’s initial recognition of the financial asset. Under this approach, the relevant business activities were ‘customer financing’ or ‘lending’, which would result in measurement at amortised cost; ‘investing’, which would result in measurement at fair value through other comprehensive income; and ‘holding for sale’ or ‘actively managing (or monitoring) the assets at fair value’, which would result in measurement at fair value through profit or loss. In order to be considered a lending (or customer financing) business activity, in addition to holding the financial assets to collect substantially all of the contractual cash flows, the entity must also have had the ability to negotiate adjustments to the contractual cash flows with the counterparty in the event of a potential credit loss.</p></body></paragraph>
