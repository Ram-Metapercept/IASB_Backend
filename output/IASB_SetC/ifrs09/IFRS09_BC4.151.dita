Fair value information reflects the cash flows that would be realised if, and when, the assets are sold. In addition, the 2012 Limited Amendments Exposure Draft proposed that when an asset measured at fair value through other comprehensive income is derecognised, the cumulative fair value gain or loss that was recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified (‘recycled’) from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment (in accordance with <xref href="../ias01/IAS01_TOC.dita#IAS01_TOC0001" base="F71850489" id="IFRS09_X2489" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 1</xref>). The IASB noted that amortised cost information would not be provided in profit or loss unless the gains or losses previously accumulated in other comprehensive income are recycled to profit or loss when the financial asset is derecognised—and, therefore, recycling was a key feature of the proposed fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category.</p></body></paragraph>
