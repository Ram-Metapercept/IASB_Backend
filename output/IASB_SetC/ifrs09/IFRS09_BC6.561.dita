Applying this exception, any amount remaining in the cash flow hedge reserve when a hedging relationship is discontinued would be reclassified to profit or loss in the same period(s) during which the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss, based on the assumption that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows are based is not altered as a result of the reform. If, however, the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur for other reasons, the entity is required to immediately reclassify to profit or loss any amount remaining in the cash flow hedge reserve. In addition, the exception would not exempt entities from reclassifying the amount that is not expected to be recovered into profit or loss as required by <xref href="IFRS09_6.5.11.dita" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 6.5.11(d)(iii) of <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_number" class="- topic/ph ">IFRS 9</ph></ph></xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
