However, in the IASB’s view, a clearly defined end point is necessary because of the temporary nature of the amendment. The exception described in <xref href="IFRS09_g6.9.11-6.9.13.dita" scope="local" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs 6.9.11–6.9.13</xref> is a significant relief from one of the requirements that is a basis for the robustness of the hedge accounting requirements, therefore the relief is intentionally short-lived. The IASB considered that a period of 24 months will assist entities in applying the hedge accounting requirements in IFRS 9 particularly during the early stages of the transition to alternative benchmark rates. Therefore, the IASB decided that a period of 24 months from the date an entity first designates an alternative benchmark rate as a non-contractually specified risk component is a reasonable period and would enable entities to implement the reform and comply with any regulatory requirements, while avoiding potential short-term disruption as the market for an alternative benchmark rate  develops.</p></body></paragraph>
