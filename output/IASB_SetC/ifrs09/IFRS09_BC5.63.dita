Thus, that guidance was carried forward from <xref href="../ifrs07/IFRS07_TOC.dita#IFRS07_TOC0001/IFRS07_TOC0001_V2" base="F71854776" id="IFRS09_X2662" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 7</xref> to IFRS 9.  However, to respond to some of the questions raised in the comment letters, the IASB decided to clarify the difference between the creditworthiness of the entity and the credit risk of a liability.  Moreover, the IASB addressed the difference between a liability’s credit risk and asset-specific performance risk —and confirmed that a change in a liability’s credit risk does not include changes in asset-specific performance risk. Furthermore, the IASB noted that in some cases a liability might not have credit risk. Consequently, the IASB included additional examples in the application guidance to clarify those points.</p></body></paragraph>
