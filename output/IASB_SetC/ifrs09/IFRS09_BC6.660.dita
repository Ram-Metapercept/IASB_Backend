Therefore, if the risk component is not reliably measurable, either when it is designated or thereafter, the alternative benchmark rate would not meet the qualifying criteria to be designated as a risk component in a hedging relationship. Similarly, if the hedging relationship fails to meet any other qualifying criteria set out in IFRS 9 to apply hedge accounting, either at the date the alternative benchmark rate is designated or during the 24-month period, the entity is required to discontinue hedge accounting prospectively from that date. The IASB decided that providing relief only for the separately identifiable requirement would achieve the objective described in <xref href="IFRS09_BC5.290.dita" scope="local" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC5.290</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
