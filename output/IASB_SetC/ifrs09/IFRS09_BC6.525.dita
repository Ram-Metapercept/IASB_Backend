The IASB noted that hedged items such as bonds or loans have ‘intrinsic’ value but not an equivalent to time value. In an effective economic hedge, the changes in the intrinsic value in the hedged item would offset the changes in the intrinsic value of the hedging instrument. During times of financial difficulty, but before a credit event (for example, before an actual default), the fair value of the loan would have decreased because of credit deterioration. Also, the fair value of the related credit default swap would increase because of the higher risk of default. Hence, the IASB considered that the increase in fair value of the credit default swap includes some intrinsic value element even though it would be difficult to isolate and separately quantify it.</p></body></paragraph>
