Instead, all financial assets were classified in their entirety. Since 2009, many interested parties have expressed support for that approach. However, others have expressed the view that hybrid financial assets should be bifurcated into a derivative component and a non‑derivative host. Much of the feedback that was received after IFRS 9 was issued in 2009 was similar to the feedback that was received during the deliberations that led to that Standard being issued. That feedback is summarised in <xref href="IFRS09_BC4.88.dita#IFRS09_BC4_88" id="IFRS09_X2538" base="F71850720" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC4.88</xref>.
