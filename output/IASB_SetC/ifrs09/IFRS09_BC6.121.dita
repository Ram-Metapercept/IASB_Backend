However, such an approach would be a significant expansion of the scope of the Hedge Accounting project because the IASB would need to address the question of how to disaggregate a hedging instrument into components. In order to be consistent, a similar question would need to be addressed for non-financial items (for example, non-financial liabilities in <xref href="../ias37/IAS37_TOC.dita#IAS37_TOC0001" base="F71859310" id="IFRS09_X2886" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets</xref> with currency or commodity risk elements). The IASB did not want to expand the scope of the hedge accounting project beyond financial instruments because the outcome of exploring this alternative would be highly uncertain, could possibly necessitate a review of other Standards and could significantly delay the project.</p></body></paragraph>
