Some of these respondents were specifically concerned about contingently convertible instruments or so‑called ‘bail‑in’ instruments. While the contractual terms of these instruments vary, generally, interested parties raised concerns about contingently convertible instruments that convert into equity instruments of the issuer on the basis of a predetermined ratio if a specified event occurs (for example, if the issuer’s regulatory capital ratios decline below a specific threshold). In the case of a bail‑in instrument, interested parties generally raised concerns about instruments with a contractual feature that requires (or permits) a portion or all of the unpaid amounts of principal and interest to be written off if a specified event occurs (for example, if the issuer has insufficient regulatory capital or is at a point of non‑viability). These respondents expressed the view that these instruments should not be measured at fair value through profit or loss merely as a result of the contingent cash flow characteristics (ie the conversion into a predetermined number of the issuer’s equity instruments or the write‑off of particular unpaid amounts upon the occurrence of a particular future event) if it is unlikely that the future event will occur.</p></body></paragraph>
