This scope exception would be separate from that for fair value hedge accounting for a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk, which complements the hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9 and which the IASB had already proposed in the 2010 Hedge Accounting Exposure Draft (see <xref href="IFRS09_BC6.88.dita#IFRS09_BC6_88" base="F71859264" id="IFRS09_X2871" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC6.88</xref>).

In the IASB’s view it was not necessary from a technical perspective to make any changes in addition to the clarifications that it had already provided (see <xref href="IFRS09_BC6.93.dita#IFRS09_BC6_93" base="F71859266" id="IFRS09_X2873" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC6.93–BC6.101</xref>). However, the IASB acknowledged that it had not yet completed its project on accounting for macro hedging and that providing a choice to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements in IAS 39 would allow entities to wait for the complete picture related to the accounting for hedging activities before applying a new hedge accounting model.</p></body></paragraph>
