Accordingly, that paragraph already accommodates a prepayment amount that is more or less than unpaid amounts of principal and interest, depending on which party chooses to terminate the contract early. In applying the effective interest method to measure such financial assets at amortised cost, an entity considers the contractual cash flows arising from such a prepayment feature when it estimates the future cash flows and determines the effective interest rate at initial recognition. Subsequently, consistent with the treatment of all financial instruments measured at amortised cost, the entity applies <xref href="IFRS09_B5.4.6.dita#IFRS09_B5_4_6" id="IFRS09_X2569" base="F74065312" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph B5.4.6 of IFRS 9</xref> and adjusts the gross carrying amount of the financial asset if it revises its estimates of contractual cash flows, including any revisions related to the exercise of the prepayment feature.</p></body></paragraph>
