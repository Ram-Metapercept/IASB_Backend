The IASB noted that IFRS 9 refers to liabilities for which the fair value option is elected as “liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss”, irrespective of whether the effects of changes in the liability’s credit risk are presented in other comprehensive income or (if that presentation would enlarge an accounting mismatch) in profit or loss. However, for the eligibility as a hedging instrument, the IASB considered that it would make a difference whether the effects of changes in the liability’s credit risk are presented in other comprehensive income or profit or loss. The IASB noted that if a financial liability whose credit risk related fair value changes are presented in other comprehensive income was an eligible hedging instrument there would be two alternatives for what could be designated as part of the hedging relationship:</p><ol outputclass="static" id="IFRS09_L0311" base="F33206610" type="lower-alpha" class="- topic/ol "><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P6529" base="F33206612" class="- topic/p ">only the part of the liability that is measured at fair value through profit or loss, in which case the hedging relationship would exclude credit risk and hence any related hedge ineffectiveness would not be recognised; or</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P6530" base="F33206614" class="- topic/p ">the entire fair value change of the liability, in which case the presentation in other comprehensive income of the changes in fair value related to changes in the credit risk of the liability would have to be overridden (ie using reclassification to profit or loss) to comply with the hedge accounting requirements.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
