The IASB considered that including an end date for that exception could require an entity to immediately discontinue hedge accounting at a point in time because, as the reform progresses, a risk component based on the interest rate benchmark may no longer be separately identifiable (for example, as the market for the alternative benchmark rate is established). As noted in <xref href="IFRS09_BC6.597.dita" scope="local" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC6.597</xref>, in the IASB’s view, such an immediate discontinuation of hedge accounting would be inconsistent with the objective of this exception in Phase 1. Therefore, when issuing the Phase 1 amendments, the IASB decided that an entity should cease applying the Phase 1 exception from the separately identifiable requirement to a hedging relationship only when that hedging relationship is discontinued applying the requirements in IFRS 9.</p></body></paragraph>
