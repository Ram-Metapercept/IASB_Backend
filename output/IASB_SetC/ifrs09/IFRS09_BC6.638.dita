The Phase 2 amendments do not include an exception from the measurement requirements in IFRS 9. Accordingly, the fair value of the hedging instrument or of the hedged item (ie the present value of the cumulative changes in the hedged expected future cash flows) is determined at the measurement date based on the expected future cash flows and assumptions that market participants would use. In other words, the fair values are not determined retrospectively. The IASB therefore considered that the cash flow hedge reserve is not remeasured as if it had been based on the alternative benchmark rate since inception of the hedging relationship.</p></body></paragraph>
