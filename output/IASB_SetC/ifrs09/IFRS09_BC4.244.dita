In contrast, others preferred a later effective date for the amendments; specifically, annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 (with earlier application permitted). These respondents observed that many entities are advanced in their implementation of IFRS 9 and may not have sufficient time before the effective date of IFRS 9 to determine the effect of these amendments. Additionally, some jurisdictions will need time for translation and endorsement activities and the proposed effective date may not provide them with sufficient time for those activities.</p></body></paragraph>
