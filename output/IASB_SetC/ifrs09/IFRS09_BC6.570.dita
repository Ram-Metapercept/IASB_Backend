As the IASB decided that entities should continue to measure and recognise hedge ineffectiveness as required by IFRS Standards, entities should continue to apply assumptions that are consistent with those applied to the hedged risk of the hedged item. For example, if an entity designated interest rate benchmark-based cash flows as the hedged item in a cash flow hedge, the entity would not assume for the purpose of measuring hedge ineffectiveness that the expected replacement of the interest rate benchmark with an alternative benchmark rate will result in zero cash flows after the replacement. The hedging gain or loss on the hedged item should be measured using the interest rate benchmark-based cash flows (that is, the cash flows on which the hypothetical derivative is based) when applying a present value technique, discounted at a market-based discount rate that reflects market participants’ assumptions about the uncertainty arising from the reform. The IASB concluded that reflecting market participants’ assumptions when measuring hedge ineffectiveness provides useful information to users of financial statements about the effects of the uncertainty arising from the reform on an entity’s hedging relationships. Therefore, the IASB decided that no exceptions are needed for the measurement of actual ineffectiveness.</p></body></paragraph>
