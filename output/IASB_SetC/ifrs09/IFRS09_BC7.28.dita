As noted in <xref href="IFRS09_gBC7.19-BC7.19.dita#IFRS09_gBC7_19_BC7_19/IFRS09_gBC7_19_BC7_19_TI" id="IFRS09_X3182" base="F71905716" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC7.19</xref>, when an entity initially applies IFRS 9 to assets, it is required to reassess particular liabilities designated under the fair value option. That was necessary because the requirements issued in IFRS 9 (2009) introduced a new classification and measurement approach for financial assets, which would change the classification of some (and perhaps many) financial assets. Those changes require an entity to reassess liabilities designated under the fair value option to the extent that designation was originally elected to address an accounting mismatch. However, the IASB believed that a similar case could not be made for the requirements added to IFRS 9 in 2010. And because the requirements issued in IFRS 9 (2009) already require reassessment of particular liabilities, the IASB believes that a second reassessment would make transition unnecessarily complex. Consequently, the IASB decided to confirm the proposal in the 2010 Own Credit Risk Exposure Draft.</p></body></paragraph>
