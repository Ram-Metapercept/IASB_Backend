That industry also argued that totals for assets and liabilities that include only the ‘net’ amount (of the linked transactions) would be most appropriate for financial analysis purposes. That industry believed that the ratios, such as leverage, should be calculated on the basis of the difference between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, ie the net amount instead of the gross amount of those items.</p></body></paragraph>
