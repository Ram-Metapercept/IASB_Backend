They noted that in an approach based on an entity’s business model for managing financial assets, reclassifications would provide useful, relevant                     and comparable information                     to users because it would ensure that financial statements faithfully represent how those financial assets are managed at the reporting date. In particular, most users stated that, conceptually, reclassifications should not be prohibited when the classification no longer reflects how the instruments would be classified if the items were newly acquired. If reclassification were prohibited, the reported information would not reflect the amounts, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows.</p></body></paragraph>
