The IASB believes that the concern is addressed for some financial assets by the clarifications to the principal and interest criterion outlined above. This is because, despite the presence of embedded features, these financial assets may economically have principal and interest cash flows. This is expected to be the case, for example, for many financial instruments with regulated interest rates and financial instruments with interest rate tenor mismatches. However, for other financial assets, for example, when the contractual cash flows are linked to an underlying that is unrelated to principal or interest, such as a commodity price, IFRS 9 (2014) will not change the requirements issued in IFRS 9 (2009). For the reasons discussed in detail in <xref href="IFRS09_BC4.88.dita#IFRS09_BC4_88" base="F71918670" id="IFRS09_X3290" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC4.88–BC4.89</xref> and <xref href="IFRS09_gBC4.196-BC4.204.dita#IFRS09_gBC4_196_BC4_204/IFRS09_gBC4_196_BC4_204_TI" base="F71918671" id="IFRS09_X3291" class="- topic/xref ">BC4.196–BC4.204</xref>, the IASB believes that classifying financial assets in their entirety instead of bifurcating them will result in financial information that is more useful in assessing the amounts, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows.</p></body></paragraph>
