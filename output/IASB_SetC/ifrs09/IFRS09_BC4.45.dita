A       restriction of this kind is often called ‘tainting’. However, the IASB believes that       classification based on the entity’s business model for managing financial assets and the       contractual cash flow characteristics of those financial assets provides a clear rationale for       measurement. A tainting provision would increase the complexity of application, be unduly       prohibitive in the context of that approach and could give rise to classification that is       inconsistent with the classification approach in IFRS 9. However, in 2009 the IASB amended         <xref href="../ias01/IAS01_TOC.dita#IAS01_TOC0001" base="F71849756" id="IFRS09_X2334" class="- topic/xref "><ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_number" class="- topic/ph ">IAS 1</ph>           <ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Presentation of Financial Statements</ph></ph></xref> to       require an entity to present separately in the statement of comprehensive income all gains and       losses arising from the derecognition of financial assets measured at amortised cost.  The IASB also amended <xref href="../ifrs07/IFRS07_TOC.dita#IFRS07_TOC0001/IFRS07_TOC0001_V2" base="F71849795" id="IFRS09_X2336" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS         7</xref> in 2009 to require an entity to disclose an analysis of those gains and losses,       including the reasons for derecognising those financial assets.  Those requirements enable users of financial statements         to understand       the effects of derecognising before maturity instruments measured at amortised cost and also       provides transparency in situations where an entity has measured financial assets at amortised       cost on the basis of having an objective of managing those assets in order to collect the       contractual cash flows but regularly sells them.</p></body></paragraph>
