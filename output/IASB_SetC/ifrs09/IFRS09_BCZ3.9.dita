In support of this conclusion, it noted that the application of the requirements in the revised IAS 39 generally resulted in answers that could have been obtained under the original IAS 39. In addition, although there would be a need to apply judgement to evaluate whether substantially all risks and rewards had been retained, this type of judgement was not new compared with the original IAS 39. However, the revised requirements clarified the application of the concepts in circumstances in which it was previously unclear how IAS 39 should be applied (this guidance is now in <xref href="IFRS09_TOC.dita#IFRS09_TOC0001" base="F71849379" id="IFRS09_X2265" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 9</xref>). The IASB concluded that it would be inappropriate to revert to the original IAS 39 without such clarifications.</p></body></paragraph>
