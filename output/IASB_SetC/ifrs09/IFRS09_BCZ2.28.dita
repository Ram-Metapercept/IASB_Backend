Consequently, the actual type of settlement (ie whether settled net in cash) would not be conclusive for the evaluation of the appropriate accounting treatment. Instead, an entity would consider not only the purpose (based solely on the actual type of settlement) but also how the contracts are managed. As a result, if an entity’s underlying business model changes and the entity no longer manages its commodity contracts on a fair value basis, the contracts would revert to the own use scope exception. This would be consistent with the criteria for using the fair value option for financial instruments (ie eliminating an accounting mismatch or if the financial instruments are managed on a fair value basis).</p></body></paragraph>
