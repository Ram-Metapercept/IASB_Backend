In addition, the IASB noted that removing the accounting policy choice would require either removing the simplified approach or making it mandatory, neither of which the IASB considered appropriate. In the IASB’s view, the benefits of achieving comparability do not outweigh the costs to implement the full model in this case. The IASB therefore decided to confirm these proposals in IFRS 9. As noted in <xref href="IFRS09_BC5.134.dita#IFRS09_BC5_134" base="F71858889" id="IFRS09_X2794" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC5.134</xref>, the IASB decided that the impairment requirements in IFRS 9 should also apply to contract assets that are recognised and measured in accordance with <xref href="../ifrs14/IFRS15_TOC.dita#IFRS15_TOC0001/IFRS15_TOC0001_V2" base="F71858884" id="IFRS09_X2795" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 15</xref>. Because the nature of contract assets and the exposure to credit risk is similar to trade receivables, the IASB decided that an entity should have the same accounting policy choice as for trade receivables with a significant financing component and for lease receivables.</p><variants id="IFRS09_E0411" class="+ topic/bodydiv ifrs-d/variants "> </variants></body></paragraph>
