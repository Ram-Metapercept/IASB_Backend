Specifically, they agreed that reasonable negative compensation for the early termination of the contract should not in itself preclude amortised cost measurement. The respondents agreed with the IASB’s rationale described in <xref href="IFRS09_BC4.226.dita#IFRS09_BC4_226" id="IFRS09_X2575" base="F74065318" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC4.226–BC4.227</xref> and they also agreed that the proposed eligibility condition would capture a population of financial assets for which amortised cost measurement could provide useful information to users of financial statements. The respondents said that measuring such assets at amortised cost, and including them in key metrics like net interest margin, would provide useful information to users of financial statements about the financial assets’ performance. Those respondents consider information about expected credit losses and interest revenue (calculated using the effective interest method) to be more relevant than information about changes in fair value for the purpose of assessing the performance and future cash flows of those financial assets.</p></body></paragraph>
