A financial asset was measured at amortised cost only if it was held within a business model whose objective was to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows (a ‘hold to collect’ business model), subject also to an assessment of the asset’s contractual cash flow characteristics. All other financial assets were measured at fair value through profit or loss. <xref href="IFRS09_BC4.15.dita#IFRS09_BC4_15" id="IFRS09_X2482" base="F71850482" class="- topic/xref ">Paragraph BC4.15–BC4.21</xref> describe the IASB’s rationale for that assessment.</p></body></paragraph>
