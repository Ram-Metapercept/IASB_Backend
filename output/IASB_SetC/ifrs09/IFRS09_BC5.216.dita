However, this does not mean that all financial assets originated at a high credit risk are within the scope—the financial assets have to be credit‑impaired on initial recognition. In confirming that a financial asset could be credit‑impaired on origination the IASB focussed on the potential for the modification of contractual cash flows to result in derecognition. The IASB considered an example in which a substantial modification of a distressed asset resulted in derecognition of the original financial asset. Such a case is an example of the rare situation in which a newly originated financial asset may be credit‑impaired—it would be possible for the modification to constitute objective evidence that the new asset is credit‑impaired at initial recognition.</p></body></paragraph>
