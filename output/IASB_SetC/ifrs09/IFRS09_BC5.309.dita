The IASB decided to limit the scope of the practical expedient so that it applies only to changes in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or a financial liability that are required by the reform. For this purpose, applying <xref href="IFRS09_5.4.7.dita" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 5.4.7 of IFRS 9</xref>, a change is required by the reform if, and only if, the change is necessary as a direct consequence of the reform and the new basis for determining the contractual cash flows is economically equivalent to the previous basis (ie the basis immediately preceding the change). This is consistent with the conditions proposed in the 2020 Exposure Draft.</p></body></paragraph>
