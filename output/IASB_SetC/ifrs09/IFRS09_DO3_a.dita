On the surface, this appears to be an improvement over IAS 39’s criterion that was based on management’s intention to trade, hold available for sale, hold to maturity, or hold for the foreseeable future. However, Ms McConnell finds it difficult to see how IFRS 9’s criterion based on the objective of the entity’s business model differs significantly from management’s intention. In her opinion selection of a business model is a management choice, as is the decision to have a trading account, use the fair value option for debt instruments or the fair value option for equity instruments with gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income. In paragraphs BC4.20 and BC4.21 the Board argues that selection of a measurement method based on an entity’s business model is not a free choice. Ms McConnell does not find the arguments persuasive.</p></body></paragraph>
