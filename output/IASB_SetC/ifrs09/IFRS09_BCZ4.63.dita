In the IASB’s view, financial reporting is best served by providing entities with the opportunity to eliminate perceived accounting mismatches whenever that results in more relevant information. Furthermore, the IASB concluded that the fair value option may validly be used in place of hedge accounting for hedges of fair value exposures, thereby eliminating the related burden of designating, tracking and analysing hedge effectiveness. Hence, the IASB decided not to develop detailed prescriptive guidance about when the fair value option could be applied (such as requiring effectiveness tests similar to those required for hedge accounting) in the amendment on the fair value option. Instead, the IASB decided to require disclosures (now in <xref href="../ifrs07/IFRS07_TOC.dita#IFRS07_TOC0001/IFRS07_TOC0001_V2" base="F71849930" id="IFRS09_X2372" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 7</xref>) about:</p><ul base="F33205034" id="IFRS09_L0239" class="- topic/ul "><li class="- topic/li ">         <p base="F33205035" id="IFRS09_P5692" class="- topic/p ">the criteria an entity uses for designating financial           assets and financial liabilities as at fair value through profit or loss </p>       </li><li class="- topic/li ">         <p base="F33205037" id="IFRS09_P5693" class="- topic/p ">how the entity satisfies the conditions for such           designation </p>       </li><li class="- topic/li ">         <p base="F33205039" id="IFRS09_P5694" class="- topic/p ">the nature of the assets and liabilities so designated </p>       </li><li class="- topic/li ">         <p base="F33205051" id="IFRS09_P5695" class="- topic/p ">the effect on the financial statement of using this           designation, namely the carrying amounts and net gains and losses on assets and           liabilities so designated, information about the effect of changes in a financial           liability’s credit quality on changes in its fair value, and information about the           credit risk of loans or receivables and any related credit derivatives or similar           instruments. </p>       </li></ul></body></paragraph>
