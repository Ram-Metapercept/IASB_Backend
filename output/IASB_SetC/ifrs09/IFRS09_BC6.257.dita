The IASB considered that moving, instead of removing, the threshold would not address the root cause of the problem (see <xref href="IFRS09_gBC6.237-BC6.251.dita#IFRS09_gBC6_237_BC6_251/IFRS09_gBC6_237_BC6_251_TI" base="F71871621" id="IFRS09_X2978" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC6.237</xref>). The suggested approach would instead only change the level of the threshold. The IASB considered that, even though the threshold would be of a qualitative nature, it would still create a danger of reverting back to a quantitative measure (such as the percentage range of IAS 39) in order for it to be operational. The IASB noted that similar concerns had been raised as part of the feedback to the 2010 Hedge Accounting Exposure Draft.</p></body></paragraph>
