It requires that the estimates of cash flows are expected values. Consequently, estimates of the amounts and timing of cash flows are the probability-weighted possible outcomes. In the IASB’s view, an expected value measurement provides relevant information about the timing, amounts and uncertainty of an entity’s future cash flows. It provides information about the risk that the investment might not perform. The amount of expected credit losses will reflect both the risk of a default occurring and the loss amount that would arise if a default were to occur. This is because all financial instruments have a risk of a default occurring. The measurement will therefore reflect that risk of default and not the most likely outcome, as is often the case in practice in accordance with <xref href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001/IAS39_TOC0001_V3" base="F71918821" id="IFRS09_X3320" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 39</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
