The IASB considered that the only way to mitigate this issue was to allow for the designation of components of the non-derivative financial instrument. This would limit the change in measurement to a component of the instrument attributable to the hedged risk. However, the IASB had already rejected that idea in its deliberations (see <xref href="IFRS09_BC6.126.dita#IFRS09_BC6_126" id="IFRS09_X2894" base="F71859349" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC6.126</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
