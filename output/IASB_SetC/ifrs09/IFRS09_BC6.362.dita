This issue is a particular concern to that industry because of the magnitude of firm commitments that are denominated in a foreign currency because of the industry’s business model. In response to that concern, the IASB considered whether applying linked presentation for fair value hedges of firm commitments might be appropriate. Linked presentation is a way of presenting information so that it shows how particular assets and liabilities are related. Linked presentation is not the same as offsetting, which presents a net asset or liability. Linked presentation displays the ‘gross’ amount of related items in the statement of financial position (while the net amount is included in the total for assets or liabilities).</p></body></paragraph>
