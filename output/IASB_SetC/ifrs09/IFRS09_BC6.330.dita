Hence, the risk management objective for a particular hedging relationship could change even though an entity’s risk management strategy remained unchanged. The IASB’s intention was to prohibit voluntary discontinuation of hedge accounting when the risk management objective at the level of a particular hedging relationship (ie not only the risk management strategy) remained the same and all other qualifying criteria were still met. </p></body></paragraph>
