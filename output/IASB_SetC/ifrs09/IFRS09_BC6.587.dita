The IASB noted that, in some cases, a contract       may be amended to include reference to the alternative benchmark rate without actually       altering the interest rate benchmark-based cash flows in the contract. Such an amendment may       not eliminate the uncertainty regarding the timing and the amount of interest rate       benchmark-based cash flows in the contract. The IASB considered the following scenarios to       assess the robustness of the end of application requirements. However, these scenarios are not       exhaustive and other scenarios may exist in which the uncertainties arising from the reform       regarding the timing and the amount of cash flows would no longer be present.</p></body></paragraph>
