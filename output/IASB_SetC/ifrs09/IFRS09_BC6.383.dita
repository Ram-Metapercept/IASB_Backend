The IASB noted that a net investment in a foreign operation was determined and accounted for in accordance with <xref href="../ias21/IAS21_TOC.dita#IAS21_TOC0001" base="F71871850" id="IFRS09_X3036" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 21</xref>. The IASB also noted that the hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation also related to IAS 21. Hence, similar to the issue of considering intragroup monetary items for eligibility as hedging instruments for hedges of foreign exchange risk (see <xref href="IFRS09_BC6.149.dita#IFRS09_BC6_149" base="F71871851" id="IFRS09_X3037" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC6.149</xref>), the IASB considered that comprehensively addressing this type of hedge would require a review of the requirements in IAS 21 at the same time as considering the hedge accounting requirements.</p></body></paragraph>
