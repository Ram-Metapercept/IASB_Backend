In addition, not reflecting the term structure might also result in the assessment that the risk of a default occurring has changed merely because of the passage of time. This could happen even if an entity had expected such a change at initial recognition. In the IASB’s view, the assessment of the criteria should not change solely because the maturity date is closer.</p></body></paragraph>
