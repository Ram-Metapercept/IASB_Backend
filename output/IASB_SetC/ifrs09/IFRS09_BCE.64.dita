However, many users of financial statements confirmed that fair value information on the balance sheet does provide useful information because, for example, it can provide early information about an entity’s credit problems. The IASB thus decided that entities should continue to have the ability to measure their non-derivative liabilities at fair value (subject to the relevant criteria that are unchanged from <xref href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001/IAS39_TOC0001_V3" base="F71918672" id="IFRS09_X3293" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 39</xref>), but that the portion of the fair value change that is a consequence of changes in the financial instrument’s credit risk should be recognised in other comprehensive income. The result of the IASB’s decisions, including the own credit requirements for financial liabilities described in <xref href="IFRS09_gBC5.35-BC5.64.dita#IFRS09_gBC5_35_BC5_64/IFRS09_gBC5_35_BC5_64_TI" base="F71918712" id="IFRS09_X3294" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC5.35–BC5.64</xref>, result in information being reported for financial liabilities that is more useful in assessing the amounts, timing and uncertainty of the entity’s future cash flows.</p></body></paragraph>
