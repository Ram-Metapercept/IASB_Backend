They argued that the Exposure Draft did not give enough guidance to enable them to account for these features. The IASB concluded it could not address such features in the short term. The IASB noted that when credit insurers issue credit insurance contracts, they typically recognise a liability measured as either the premium received or an estimate of the expected losses. However, the IASB was concerned that some other issuers of financial guarantee contracts might argue that no recognisable liability existed at inception. To provide a temporary solution that balances these competing concerns, the IASB decided the following:</p><ol outputclass="static" base="F33203801" type="lower-alpha" id="IFRS09_L0212" class="- topic/ol "><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(a)</li_value>         <p base="F33203803" id="IFRS09_P5446" class="- topic/p ">If the issuer of financial guarantee contracts has previously asserted explicitly that it regards such contracts as insurance contracts and has used accounting applicable to insurance contracts, the issuer may elect to apply either <xref href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001/IAS39_TOC0001_V3" base="F71849071" id="IFRS09_X2218" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 39</xref> or <ph class="- topic/ph ">IFRS 4</ph> to such financial guarantee contracts.</p>       </li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(b)</li_value>         <p base="F33203807" id="IFRS09_P5447" class="- topic/p ">In all other cases, the issuer of a financial guarantee contract should apply IAS 39.</p>       </li></ol></body></paragraph>
