Given that the new classification model for financial assets is based on the entity’s business model for managing its financial assets and those assets’ contractual cash flow characteristics, it is reasonable to conclude that the costs incurred and the benefits obtained in complying with the new requirements will depend on the entity’s business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of its financial assets.</p></body></paragraph>
