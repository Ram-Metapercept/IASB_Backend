At initial recognition, the timing of initial expected credit losses affects the amount of the adjustment to the effective interest rate. Thus, an earlier expected credit loss would give rise to a larger credit adjustment to the effective interest rate than a later expected credit loss of an equal nominal value. Because the pattern of initially expected credit losses is priced into the asset as represented by its present value, compensation is received for the amount and timing of those initially expected credit losses. Thus, in the IASB’s view, if initial credit loss expectations do not subsequently change:</p><ol outputclass="static" id="IFRS09_L0287" base="F33209179" type="lower-alpha" class="- topic/ol "><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P6219" base="F33209180" class="- topic/p ">interest revenue should reflect the credit-adjusted effective return over time; and</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P6220" base="F33209182" class="- topic/p ">there is no credit loss (or gain), because no economic loss (or gain) has occurred.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
