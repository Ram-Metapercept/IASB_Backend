The IASB considered that one type of distortion of other comprehensive income was inevitable (ie either in the period of the basis adjustment or over the total period) and hence there was a trade-off. The IASB concluded that, on balance, the effect of a reclassification adjustment in the period of the basis adjustment would be more misleading than the effect over the total period of not using a reclassification adjustment.</p></body></paragraph>
