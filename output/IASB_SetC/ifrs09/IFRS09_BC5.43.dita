Those respondents suggested that the proposals should not apply to those items because the IASB’s intention seemingly had always been to address the issue of own credit risk for non-derivative liabilities. The respondents noted that loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts either meet the definition of a derivative or are very similar to a derivative from an economic perspective and therefore changes in their fair value should always be presented in profit or loss. The IASB agreed with those respondents and decided that all changes in the fair value of loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts designated under the fair value option should be presented in profit or loss.  In addition to the comments put forward by respondents, the IASB also noted that phase II of the insurance project<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS09_FN0124" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/> was discussing whether all financial guarantee contracts should be within the scope of that proposed Standard.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
