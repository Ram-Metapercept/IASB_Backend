Most of the respondents that disagreed with the second eligibility condition said the first eligibility condition (discussed above in <xref href="IFRS09_gBC4.222-BC4.232.dita#IFRS09_gBC4_222_BC4_232/IFRS09_gBC4_222_BC4_232_TI" id="IFRS09_X2579" base="F74065362" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC4.222–BC4.232</xref>) was sufficient.

Some respondents suggested alternatives that they thought would better achieve the IASB’s objective. Those suggestions included assessing the probability that prepayment, or negative compensation, will occur.</p></body></paragraph>
