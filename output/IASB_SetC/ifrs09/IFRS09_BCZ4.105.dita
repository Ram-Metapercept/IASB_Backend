For example, assume that an entity, when it first becomes a party to a contract, separately recognises a host asset<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS09_FN0104" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/> and an embedded derivative liability. If the entity were required to reassess whether the embedded derivative was to be accounted for separately and if the entity concluded some time after becoming a party to the contract that the derivative was no longer required to be separated, then questions of recognition and measurement would arise. In the above circumstances, the IFRIC identified the following possibilities:</p><ol outputclass="static" id="IFRS09_L0247" base="F33205448" type="lower-alpha" class="- topic/ol "><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P5770" base="F33205449" class="- topic/p ">The entity could remove the derivative from its balance sheet and recognise in profit or loss a corresponding gain or loss.

The issue would then arise as to when the item was to be removed from the balance sheet. Should it be amortised (and, if so, how would the amortisation affect the effective interest rate of the asset), or should it be derecognised only when the asset is derecognised?</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P5772" base="F33205453" class="- topic/p ">The entity could combine the derivative (which is recognised at fair value) with the asset (which is recognised at amortised cost). This would alter both the carrying amount of the asset and its effective interest rate even though there had been no change in the economics of the whole contract.
