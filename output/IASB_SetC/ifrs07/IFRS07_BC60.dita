For example, the analysis may not reveal non‑linearities in sensitivities or the effects of interdependencies between variables. The Board decided to meet the first concern by requiring additional disclosure when the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of a risk inherent in a financial instrument (<xref href="IFRS07_42.dita#IFRS07_42" id="IFRS07_X1652" base="F15833561" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 42</xref>). The Board noted that it could meet the second concern by requiring a more complex sensitivity analysis that takes into account the interdependencies between risks. Although more informative, such an analysis is also more complex and costly to prepare. Accordingly, the Board decided not to require such an analysis, but to permit its disclosure as an alternative to the minimum requirement when it is used by management to manage risk.</p></body></paragraph>
