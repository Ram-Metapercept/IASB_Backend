The Board thought that such a disclosure would provide potentially misleading information to users of financial statements. This is because users of financial statements might think that all financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments might be held for speculative purposes. This is not necessarily the case. Entities might hold financial instruments for hedging purposes but may decide not to elect hedge accounting. In addition to this, the Board thought that, because entities need to provide the information that requires a tabular format based on the same level of aggregation or disaggregation as in <xref href="../ifrs13/IFRS13_TOC.dita#IFRS13_TOC0001/IFRS13_TOC0001_V2" base="F34942725" id="IFRS07_X1535" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 13</xref>, users of financial statements should be able to identify the financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments by simply comparing the disclosures with each other. In addition, users should be able to understand how an entity manages the risks it is exposed to as a result of financial instruments using the disclosure requirements in IFRS 7 that are not related to the hedge accounting disclosures.</p></body></paragraph>
