The Board decided to require disclosure of the change in fair value of the hedging instruments and the change in the value of the hedged items on the basis that is used to calculate the hedge ineffectiveness that is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. Those are the changes in value during the period (after taking into account the effect of the ‘lower of’ test for cash flow hedges and hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation). This means that the difference between the amount included in the table for hedged items and the amount included in the table for hedging instruments equals the hedge ineffectiveness recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.</p></body></paragraph>
