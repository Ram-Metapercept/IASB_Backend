Respondents (including preparers) generally supported disclosing a reconciliation (ie flow information) of changes in the loss allowance and stated that it was operational and useful. However, similar to the feedback received on the Supplementary Document, respondents to the 2013 Impairment Exposure Draft commented that showing separate reconciliations of the gross carrying amount of financial assets was onerous, especially when they were required to disclose the effect of the change of financial assets between those with loss allowances measured at amounts equal to 12-month and lifetime expected credit losses. They noted that when loss allowances are determined on a collective (ie portfolio) basis, an entity does not allocate loss allowances to individual financial assets. Preparers also stated that the costs associated with the disclosure, and any disclosure about flow information, would be substantial. In order to provide this information for open portfolios, an entity would be required to track changes in the credit risk of individual financial instruments and calculate the change in the loss allowance that results from new loans, derecognised assets, changes between 12-month and lifetime loss allowances and changes in estimates of credit losses. They noted that this would be contrary to the requirement in <xref href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_TOC.dita#IFRS09_TOC0001" base="F43926600" id="IFRS07_X1595" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 9</xref> which requires lifetime expected credit losses to be recognised even if a significant increase in credit risk cannot be identified on an individual financial instrument basis.</p></body></paragraph>
