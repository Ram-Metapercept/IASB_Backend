The Board’s predecessor, the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC), issued a number of Standards that addressed, more comprehensively, some of the topics previously addressed only for banks in IAS 30. Also, fundamental changes were taking place in the financial services industry and in the way in which financial institutions manage their activities and risk exposures. This made it increasingly difficult for users of banks’ financial statements to assess and compare their financial position and performance, their associated risk exposures, and their processes for measuring and managing those risks.</p></body></paragraph>
