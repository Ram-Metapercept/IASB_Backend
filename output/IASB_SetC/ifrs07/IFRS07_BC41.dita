The requirements in <xref href="IFRS07_33.dita#IFRS07_33" id="IFRS07_X1565" base="F16459310" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs 33–42</xref> combine qualitative disclosures of the entity’s exposure to risks arising from financial instruments, and the way in which management views and manages these risks, with quantitative disclosures about material risks arising from financial instruments. The extent of disclosure depends on the extent of the entity’s exposure to risks arising from financial instruments. The guidance on implementing the IFRS illustrates how an entity might apply the IFRS. This guidance is consistent with the disclosure requirements for banks developed by the Basel Committee (known as Pillar 3), so that banks can prepare, and users receive, a single co‑ordinated set of disclosures about financial risk.</p></body></paragraph>
