The Board decided that if transfer activity is concentrated around the end of reporting periods, disclosure of this fact provides an indication of whether transfer transactions are undertaken for the purpose of altering the appearance of the statement of financial position rather than for an ongoing commercial or financing purpose. In such cases, the amendments require disclosure of when the greatest transfer activity took place within that reporting period, the amount recognised from the transfer activity in that part of the reporting period, and the total amount of proceeds from transfer activity in that part of the reporting period.</p></body></paragraph>
