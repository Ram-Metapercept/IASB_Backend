They said that it is more important to understand the risks that the entity manages and the results after hedging. However, to provide information effectively on the effects of hedge accounting on the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and the statement of financial position, the information should reflect the accounting that was applied (for example, cash flow hedge accounting or fair value hedge accounting). The Board believed that if the proposed table is prepared by risk category and by type of hedge, the table would provide sufficient links between the accounting information and the risk management information.</p></body></paragraph>
