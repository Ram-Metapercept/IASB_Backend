In the light of this feedback the Board decided to remove the requirement to provide a disaggregation across a minimum of three credit risk rating grades, and instead require that the disaggregation to be aligned with how credit risk is managed internally. The Board additionally decided to permit the use of an ageing analysis for financial assets for which delinquency information is the only borrower-specific information available to assess significant increases in credit risk.</p></body></paragraph>
