This proposed requirement resulted from users of financial statements requesting information to enable them to understand the amount of financial assets that have been modified and that have subsequently improved in credit quality. During redeliberations the Board noted operational concerns raised in feedback from preparers about the need to meet such a requirement by tracking individual financial assets, particularly even long after such assets have returned to a performing status and are no longer closely monitored for credit risk management purposes. The Board noted that the usefulness of the information would decrease over time as an increasing number of assets are required to be included in the disclosure. The Board therefore decided to limit the requirement to financial assets that have previously been modified at a time when the loss allowance was measured at lifetime expected credit losses and for which the loss allowance has changed back to 12-month expected credit losses during the reporting period.</p></body></paragraph>
