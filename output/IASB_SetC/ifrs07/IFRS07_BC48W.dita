Consequently, the Board decided that an entity should disclose the undiscounted expected credit losses that are implicit in the pricing at initial recognition for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets. Users of financial statements have indicated that such a disclosure would be helpful in alleviating some of the complexity in this area of accounting and would allow them to see the possible contractual cash flows that an entity could collect if there was a favourable change in expectations of credit losses for such assets.</p></body></paragraph>
