Depending on the terms of the collateral arrangement, collateral will often reduce an entity’s exposure in the events of default and insolvency or bankruptcy of a counterparty to the contract. Collateral received or pledged against financial assets and financial liabilities may often be liquidated immediately upon an event of default. Consequently, the boards concluded that the amounts of collateral that are not set off in the statement of financial position but that are associated with other netting arrangements should be included in the amounts disclosed as required by <xref href="IFRS07_13C.dita#IFRS07_13C" id="IFRS07_X1474" base="F17328311" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 13C(d)(ii)</xref> of IFRS 7.</p></body></paragraph>
