This was included because feedback from users of financial statements indicated users would like to understand the extent to which recoveries of written off assets are still possible. The Board acknowledged this desire, however it determined that the disclosure of the aggregate amount of financial assets that have been written off but that remain subject to enforcement activity would not provide the most relevant information for this purpose. For example, the nominal amount could be very high (particularly as time passes, if the asset legally continues to accrue interest) even though the prospect of recovering any amounts outstanding might be extremely low. In addition, the Board received feedback from preparers that tracking these amounts for an extended period would be operationally burdensome. As a result, the Board decided to modify the disclosure and require that entities disclose the amount of financial assets that have been written off during the period, while narrative information is provided about financial assets that have previously been written off but that are still subject to enforcement activity.</p></body></paragraph>
