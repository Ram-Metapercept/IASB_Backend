Consequently, the Board observed that the servicer’s obligation to pass through to one or more entities the cash flows that it collects from a transferred financial asset is not in itself continuing involvement for the purposes of the disclosure requirements, because the activity of passing through cash flows does not in itself constitute an interest in the future performance of the transferred financial asset. The Board observed, however, that a servicing contract is generally continuing involvement for the purposes of the transfer disclosure requirements because, in most cases, the servicer has an interest in the future performance of the transferred financial assets as a result of that contract. That would be the case if the amount and/or timing of the servicing fee depended on the amount and/or timing of the cash flows collected from the transferred financial asset. This would be true irrespective of how the servicer receives its servicing fee; ie whether the servicer retains a portion of the cash flows collected from the transferred financial asset as its fee or it passes through all of the cash flows collected and receives its fee separately from the transferee or another entity.</p></body></paragraph>
