As described in greater detail in other sections of this Basis for Conclusions on <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Disclosures—Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities</ph></ph> (Amendments to IFRS 7), the Board considered that there is significant benefit to market participants in providing these disclosures. The disclosures address a significant difference between the amounts presented in statements of financial position prepared in accordance with IFRSs and amounts presented in statements of financial position prepared in accordance with US GAAP, particularly for entities that have large amounts of derivative activities. The disclosures therefore make the amounts presented in accordance with both sets of standards more comparable.</p></body></paragraph>
