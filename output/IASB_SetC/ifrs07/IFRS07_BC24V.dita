Disclosure by type of financial instrument may (or may not) differ from the class of financial instrument used for other disclosures in IFRS 7, but is appropriate in circumstances where a difference would better achieve the objective of the disclosures required by these amendments. The boards also decided to provide flexibility as to whether the information required by <xref href="IFRS07_13C.dita#IFRS07_13C" id="IFRS07_X1480" base="F17328317" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 13C(c)–(e)</xref> of IFRS 7 is presented by type of financial instrument or by counterparty. This would allow preparers to present the disclosures in the same way that they manage their credit exposure.</p></body></paragraph>
