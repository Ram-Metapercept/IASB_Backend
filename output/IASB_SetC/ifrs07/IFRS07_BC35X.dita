Consequently, it would result in disclosures about forward looking information and the rates at which future transactions are hedged. The Board acknowledged that this would potentially provide competitors with insight into an entity’s costing structure. Consequently, the Board decided not to require information to be disclosed about the total risk exposure because of the potential forward looking nature of this information. The Board also decided to change the focus of the proposed disclosure from the hedged item to the hedging instrument. In other words, the disclosure would require information on some of the terms and conditions of the hedging instrument to be provided. The Board believes that this information will still be relevant and useful for users of financial statements in inferring the exposure that an entity is exposed to and what the effects will be on future cash flows as a result of how the entity manages the particular risk.</p></body></paragraph>
