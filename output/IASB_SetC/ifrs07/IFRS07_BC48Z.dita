The Board rejected these views and confirmed that the scope of this guidance applies to all modifications of contractual cash flows, regardless of the reason for the modification. In making this decision, the Board noted that an amortised cost carrying amount equates to the present value of the expected contractual cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate. Consequently, the carrying amount should reflect changes in those contractual cash flows, irrespective of the reason for the modification occurring. In addition, it was noted that any change in contractual terms will have an impact on credit risk, even if small. Furthermore, the Board noted that it has been told previously that identifying those modifications that have been performed for credit risk management (ie non-commercial) purposes is operationally challenging. Consequently, the disclosures in paragraph 35J of IFRS 7 apply to all modifications of contractual cash flows.</p></body></paragraph>
