While these financial instruments may not have experienced an increase in credit risk greater than those evaluated on a group basis, the Board concluded that this distinction helps users of financial statements to understand how an entity is monitoring and managing credit risk, so it is useful even when the difference is not attributable to differences in credit risk.</p></body></paragraph>
