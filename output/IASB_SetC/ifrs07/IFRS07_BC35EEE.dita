To achieve this balance, the Board sought to develop disclosure requirements that would provide useful information to users of financial statements about the effects of the reform on an entityâ€™s financial instruments and risk management strategy without requiring disclosures for which the cost of providing that information would outweigh the benefits of the amendments. Consequently, the Board decided not to require quantitative disclosures of what the effects of the reform would have been in the absence of the Phase 2 amendments because the cost of providing such information could outweigh the benefits provided by the amendments. For the same reason, the Board decided not to require entities to provide the disclosure that would otherwise be required by <xref href="../ias08/IAS08_28.dita" scope="local" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 28(f) of <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_number" class="- topic/ph ">IAS 8</ph></ph></xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
