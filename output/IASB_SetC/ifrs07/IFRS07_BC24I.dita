The boards specifically excluded loans and customer deposits with the same financial institution from the scope of these requirements (except in the limited cases when the respective offsetting model is satisfied). This reduced scope still responds to the needs of users of financial statements for information about amounts that have been set off in accordance with IFRSs and amounts that have been set off in accordance with US GAAP. The types of instruments that fall within the scope of these disclosures include the instruments that cause significant differences between amounts presented in statements of financial position prepared in accordance with IFRSs and amounts presented in statements of financial position prepared in accordance with US GAAP.</p></body></paragraph>
