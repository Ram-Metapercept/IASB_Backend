Quantitative information about financial assets and financial liabilities that—as at the end of the reporting period—reference interest rate benchmarks that are subject to the reform would therefore assist users of financial statements to assess an entity’s progress towards implementing the reform. The Board also considered that for this disclosure to be useful, the quantitative information about non-derivative financial assets, non-derivative financial liabilities and derivatives that continue to reference interest rate benchmarks subject to the reform should be provided in the context of the total non-derivative financial assets, total non-derivative financial liabilities and total derivatives as at the end of the reporting period.</p></body></paragraph>
