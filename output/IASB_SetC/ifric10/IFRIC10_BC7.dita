Entity A prepares quarterly interim financial statements and Entity B prepares half‑yearly financial statements. The entities have the same year‑end. The IFRIC noted that if there was a significant decline in the fair value of the equity instrument below its cost in the first quarter, Entity A would recognise an impairment loss in its first quarter interim financial statements. However, if the fair value of the equity instrument subsequently recovered, so that by the half‑year date there had not been a significant decline in fair value below cost, Entity B would not recognise an impairment loss in its half‑yearly financial statements if it tested for impairment only at its half‑yearly reporting dates. Therefore, unless Entity A reversed the impairment loss that had been recognised in an earlier interim period, the frequency of reporting would affect the measurement of its annual results when compared with Entity B’s approach. The IFRIC also noted that the recognition of an impairment loss could similarly be affected by the timing of the financial year‑ends of the two entities.</p></body></paragraph>
