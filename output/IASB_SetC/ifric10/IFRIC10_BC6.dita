The IFRIC considered these responses but maintained its view that such losses should not be reversed in subsequent financial statements. The IFRIC observed that the wide divergence of views evident from respondents’ letters underlined the need for additional guidance and it therefore decided to issue the Interpretation with few changes from D18.</p></body></paragraph>
