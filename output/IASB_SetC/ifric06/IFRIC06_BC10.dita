In accordance with <xref href="../ias37/IAS37_19.dita" scope="local" id="IFRIC06_X0028" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 19 of IAS 37</xref>, a provision can be recognised only in respect of an obligation that arises independently of the entity’s future actions. For historical household equipment the obligation is created only by the future actions of the entity. If an entity has no market share in a measurement period, it has no obligation for the waste management costs relating to the products of that type which it had previously manufactured or sold and which otherwise would have created an obligation in that measurement period. This differentiates waste management costs, for example, from warranties (see <xref href="../ias37/IAS37_IE_C_ex1.dita#IAS37_0008/IAS37_0008_TI" base="F15826776" id="IFRIC06_X0029" class="- topic/xref ">Example 1 in the guidance on implementing IAS 37</xref>), which represent a legal obligation even if the entity exits the market. Consequently, no obligation exists for the future waste management costs until the entity participates in the market during the measurement period.</p></body></paragraph>
