Some respondents noted that matrix organisational structures are commonly used for large complex organisations and that mandating the use of components based on products and services was inconsistent with the management approach. The Board agreed with this view. Accordingly, the IFRS requires the identification of operating segments to be made by reference to the core principle of the IFRS.</p></body></paragraph>
