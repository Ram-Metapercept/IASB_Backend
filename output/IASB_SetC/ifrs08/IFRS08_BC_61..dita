They note that the business review section and the chairman’s letter in an annual report frequently discuss the enterprise’s operations on a basis different from that of the segment information in the notes to the financial statements and the management’s discussion and analysis section, which is required by SEC rules to correspond to the segment information provided to comply with Statement 14. That appears to occur if the enterprise is not managed in a way that corresponds to the way it defines segments under the requirements of Statement 14. Segmentation based on the structure of an enterprise’s internal organization should facilitate consistent discussion of segment financial results throughout an enterprise’s annual report.</p></body></paragraph>
