They expressed the view that such information would be relevant when a large proportion of an entity’s business is carried out in its country of domicile. They noted, however, that in many circumstances the country of domicile represents a small proportion of the entity’s business and in these cases the information required would not be relevant. In addition, they argued that SFAS 131 had been designed for entities in the US, for whom the ‘country of domicile’ is in itself a significant geographical area. These respondents suggested that disclosures should instead be required about the country of principal activities.</p></body></paragraph>
