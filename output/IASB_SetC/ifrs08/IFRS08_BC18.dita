The Board noted that it was premature to adopt the proposed definition of public accountability that is being considered in a separate Board project on small and medium‑sized entities (SMEs). However, the Board decided that the scope of the standard should be extended to include entities that hold assets in a fiduciary capacity for a broad group of outsiders. The Board concluded that the SMEs project is the most appropriate context in which to decide whether to extend the scope of the requirements on segment reporting to other entities.</p></body></paragraph>
