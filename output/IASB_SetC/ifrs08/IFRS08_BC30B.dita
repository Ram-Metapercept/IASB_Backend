The Board thinks that including a disclosure requirement in paragraph 22 would provide users of financial statements with an understanding of the judgements made by management on how (and the reasons why) operating segments have been aggregated. The judgements made by management may relate to the application of any of the criteria in <xref href="IFRS08_12.dita#IFRS08_12" id="IFRS08_X0266" base="F35271399" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 12</xref>, which states that two or more operating segments may be aggregated into a single operating segment if aggregation is consistent with the core principle of IFRS 8, the segments have similar economic characteristics and the segments are similarly based on the factors listed in paragraph 12(a)–(e). Consequently, the Board added paragraph 22(aa) to complement the disclosure required in paragraph 22(a). The requirements in paragraph 22(b) remain the same and its wording has not been modified.</p></body></paragraph>
