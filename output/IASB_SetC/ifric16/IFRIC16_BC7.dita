This is because each foreign operation is translated only once into the presentation currency. In contrast, the submission stated that if the step‑by‑step method was required, the hedged risk that qualifies for hedge accounting is the risk between the functional currencies of the foreign operation and the immediate parent entity into which the entity was consolidated. This is because each foreign operation is consolidated directly into its immediate parent entity.</p></body></paragraph>
