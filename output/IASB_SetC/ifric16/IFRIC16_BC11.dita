If the presentation currency of the group and the functional currency of the parent entity are the same, the exchange rate being hedged would be identified as that between the parent entity’s functional currency and the foreign operation’s functional currency. No further translation adjustment would be required to prepare the consolidated financial statements. However, when the functional currency of the parent entity is different from the presentation currency of the group, a translation adjustment will be included in other comprehensive income to present the consolidated financial statements in a different presentation currency. The issue, therefore, is how to determine which foreign currency risk may be designated as the hedged risk in accordance with <xref href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita#IAS39_TOC0001" base="F28730578" id="IFRIC16_X0099" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 39 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement</ph></ph></xref><xref keyref="footnotes/IFRIC16_FN0003" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/> in the hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
