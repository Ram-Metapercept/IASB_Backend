The Board noted that paragraphs AG13–AG15 of IFRIC 16 illustrate that a non‑derivative instrument held by the foreign operation does not need to be considered to be part of the parent’s net investment. As a result, even if it is denominated in the foreign operation’s functional currency a non‑derivative instrument could still affect the profit or loss of the consolidated group. Consequently, although it could be argued that the amendment was not required to permit non‑derivative instruments to be designated as hedges, the Board decided that the proposal should not be changed.</p></body></paragraph>
