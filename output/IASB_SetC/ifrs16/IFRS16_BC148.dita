However, initial measurement of a right-of-use asset at cost is consistent with the measurement of many other non-financial assets, such as assets within the scope of <xref href="../ias16/IAS16_TOC.dita#IAS16_TOC0001/IAS16_TOC0001_V2" base="F47962645" id="IFRS16_X0942" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 16</xref> and <xref href="../ias38/IAS38_TOC0001.dita#IAS38_TOC0001/IAS38_TOC0001_V2" base="F47962646" id="IFRS16_X0943" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 38</xref>. Measuring right-of-use assets on a basis similar to that used to measure the underlying asset maintains the comparability of amounts reported for leased and owned assets, which contributes to the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. Furthermore, measuring the right-of-use asset at cost is less complex and less costly for entities than measuring that asset at fair value, because there often is not an active market for right-of-use assets. The IASB thinks that, for many leases, a cost measurement basis will also provide a reasonable approximation of the fair value of the right-of-use asset at the commencement date.</p></body></paragraph>
