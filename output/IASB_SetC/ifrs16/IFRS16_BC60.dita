Those respondents had asked the IASB to address both lessee and lessor accounting at the same time because they thought that developing consistent and symmetrical accounting for lessees and lessors would be beneficial. In addition, some users of financial statements had argued that the lessor accounting model in IAS 17 did not provide sufficient information about a lessor’s exposure to residual asset risk (ie the risks retained as a result of its remaining interest in the underlying asset). Accordingly, the IASB proposed changes to lessor accounting in the 2010 and 2013 Exposure Drafts that were more symmetrical with the lessee accounting model ultimately included in <xref href="IFRS16_TOC.dita#IFRS16_TOC0001" base="F47962080" id="IFRS16_X0805" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 16</xref>, because these proposals would have required a lessor to recognise a lease receivable for all (or many) leases.</p></body></paragraph>
