Specific areas of the proposals that stakeholders highlighted as being particularly costly or complex included the dual lessee and lessor accounting models (both the lease classification proposals and the accounting requirements), the reassessment proposals, the disclosure proposals and the scope of the transactions subject to the proposals.</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(d)</li_value> <p id="IFRS16_P1852" base="F45930625" class="- topic/p ">the majority of stakeholders disagreed with the proposed lessor accounting model.
