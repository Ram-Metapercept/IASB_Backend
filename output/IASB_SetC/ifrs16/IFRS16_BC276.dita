A full retrospective approach would require entities to determine the carrying amounts of all leases in existence at the earliest comparative period as if those leases had always been accounted for applying <xref href="IFRS16_TOC.dita#IFRS16_TOC0001" base="F47963349" id="IFRS16_X1143" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 16</xref> and to restate comparative information. That could be impracticable for entities that have thousands of leases. Nonetheless, the IASB did not wish to prohibit entities from applying a full retrospective approach, because that approach would provide better information to users of financial statements than other approaches. Consequently, the IASB decided to permit entities to choose to apply IFRS 16 fully retrospectively with restatement of comparative information.</p></body></paragraph>
