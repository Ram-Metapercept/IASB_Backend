The IASB acknowledged that there might be costs involved with determining the fair value of right-of-use assets, particularly for entities that are not in the property industry but sublease property, for example, because that property is not needed for use within their business. However, the IASB noted that there are two factors that will lessen the likelihood that entities that are not in the property industry will hold investment property as a right-of-use asset:</p><ol outputclass="static" base="F45931618" id="IFRS16_L0142" type="lower-alpha" class="- topic/ol "><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(a)</li_value> <p base="F45931619" id="IFRS16_P2119" class="- topic/p "><xref href="IFRS16_TOC.dita#IFRS16_TOC0001" base="F47962740" id="IFRS16_X0973" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 16</xref> requires an entity to classify a sublease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease (see <xref href="IFRS16_gBC233-BC234.dita#IFRS16_gBC233_BC234/IFRS16_gBC233_BC234_TI" base="F47962777" id="IFRS16_X0974" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC233–BC234</xref>). Consequently, an intermediate lessor would classify a sublease as a finance lease if it subleases the asset for all or most of the remaining term of the head lease. In those cases, the intermediate lessor would apply finance lease accounting (ie recognise a net investment in the sublease rather than the underlying right-of-use asset) and, thus, would not be required to apply the requirements of <xref href="../ias40/IAS40_TOC0001.dita#IAS40_TOC0001/IAS40_TOC0001_V4" base="F47962778" id="IFRS16_X0975" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 40</xref>. The IASB observed that entities that are not in the property industry that wish to reduce property costs would generally aim to secure a sublease for the entire remaining period of the head lease, which (if successful) would result in finance lease accounting.</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(b)</li_value> <p base="F45931621" id="IFRS16_P2120" class="- topic/p ">entities that are not in the property industry may not be within the scope of IAS 40 if they sublease a property under an operating lease with the intention of subsequently using the property within their own business.
