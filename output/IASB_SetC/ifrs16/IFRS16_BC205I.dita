The Board was informed that lessees continue to face challenges accounting for rent       concessions, especially in the light of the many other challenges lessees face during the       pandemic. Almost all stakeholders—including almost all users of financial statements—that       provided feedback on the 2021 amendment supported extending the availability of the practical       expedient. Users of financial statements agreed that the ongoing severity of the pandemic had       not been envisaged when the Board originally developed the practical expedient in May 2020;       they nonetheless highlighted the continued importance of limiting the availability of the       practical expedient so that it can be used only when it is needed most. The Board acknowledged       that lessees were no longer applying <xref href="IFRS16_TOC.dita" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 16</xref> for the first       time, but concluded that, in all other respects, extending the scope of the practical       expedient would be consistent with the Board’s objectives when it originally developed the       practical expedient in May 2020 (see <xref href="IFRS16_BC205B.dita" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph       BC205B</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
