In the IASB’s view, a more detailed maturity analysis will enable users of financial statements to more accurately forecast future lease cash flows and estimate liquidity risk. The IASB does not expect the incremental cost (compared to the IAS 17 requirements) to be significant because lessors typically needed the same information to provide the disclosures required by IAS 17. The IASB also noted that some lessors had already disclosed a maturity analysis relating to lease payments to be received in more detail than was required by IAS 17.</p></body></paragraph>
