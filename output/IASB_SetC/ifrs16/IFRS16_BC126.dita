The joint arrangement might be a joint venture or a joint operation. The contract might be signed by the joint arrangement itself if the joint arrangement has its own legal identity, or it might be signed by one or more of the parties to the joint arrangement on behalf of the joint arrangement. In these cases, the IASB decided to clarify that an entity should consider the joint arrangement to be the customer when assessing whether the contract contains a lease applying <xref href="IFRS16_g9-17.dita#IFRS16_g9_17/IFRS16_g9_17_TI" base="F47962542" id="IFRS16_X0904" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs 9–11 of IFRS 16</xref>—ie the parties to the joint arrangement should not each be considered to be a customer. Accordingly, if the parties to the joint arrangement collectively have the right to control the use of an identified asset throughout the period of use through their joint control of the arrangement, the contract contains a lease. In that scenario, it would be inappropriate to conclude that a contract does not contain a lease on the grounds that each of the parties to the joint arrangement either obtains only a portion of the economic benefits from use of the underlying asset or does not unilaterally direct the use of the underlying asset.</p></body></paragraph>
