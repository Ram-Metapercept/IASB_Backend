In response to stakeholder       feedback, the Board decided to highlight—in paragraph <xref href="IFRS16_C20BC.dita" class="- topic/xref ">C20BC of         IFRS 16</xref>—the relevance of <xref href="IFRS16_2.dita" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 2 of IFRS 16       </xref>when first applying the 2021 amendment. Applying paragraph 2, a lessee that had already       applied the practical expedient in <xref href="IFRS16_46A.dita" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 46A </xref>would be       required to apply the extended scope of the practical expedient to eligible contracts with       similar characteristics and in similar circumstances. Similarly, the 2021 amendment did not       allow a lessee to elect to apply the practical expedient if the lessee did not apply the       practical expedient to eligible rent concessions with similar characteristics and in similar       circumstances, including those that reduce only lease payments due on or before 30 June 2021.       At the time the Board issued the 2021 amendment, a lessee may not have established an       accounting policy on applying (or not applying) the practical expedient to eligible rent       concessions. Such a lessee could still decide to apply the practical expedient, however that       lessee would be required to do so retrospectively and to apply it consistently to contracts       with similar characteristics and in similar circumstances.</p></body></paragraph>
