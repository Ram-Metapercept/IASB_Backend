The practical expedient does not otherwise interpret or change any requirements in <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_number" class="- topic/ph ">IFRS 16</ph></ph>. The Board observed therefore that a lessee would account for the lease liability and right-of-use asset applying the requirements in <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_number" class="- topic/ph ">IFRS 16</ph></ph>, which, for example, incorporate requirements in <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_number" class="- topic/ph ">IAS 16</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Property, Plant and Equipment</ph></ph>. With this in mind, the Board considered how a lessee applying the practical expedient would account for three types of change in lease payments:</p><ol outputclass="static" type="lower-alpha" class="- topic/ol "><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(a)</li_value>         <p class="- topic/p ">a lessee applying the practical expedient would generally account for a forgiveness or waiver of lease payments as a variable lease payment applying paragraph 38 of <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_number" class="- topic/ph ">IFRS 16</ph></ph>. The lessee would also make a corresponding adjustment to the lease liability—in effect, derecognising the part of the lease liability that has been forgiven or waived.</p>       </li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(b)</li_value>         <p class="- topic/p ">a change in lease payments that reduces payments in one period but proportionally increases payments in another does not extinguish the lessee’s lease liability or change the consideration for the lease—instead, it changes only the timing of individual payments. In this case, applying paragraph 36 of <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_number" class="- topic/ph ">IFRS 16</ph></ph>, a lessee would continue to both recognise interest on the lease liability and reduce that liability to reflect lease payments made to the lessor.</p>       </li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(c)</li_value>         <p class="- topic/p ">some covid-19-related rent concessions reduce lease payments, incorporating both a forgiveness or waiver of payments and a change in the timing of payments.</p>       </li></ol></body></paragraph>
