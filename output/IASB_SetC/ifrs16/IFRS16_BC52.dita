The measurement proposals for variable lease payments and optional lease periods were simplified in the 2013 Exposure Draft, and these simplifications have been retained in <xref href="IFRS16_TOC.dita#IFRS16_TOC0001" base="F47962074" id="IFRS16_X0799" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 16</xref>.

The IASB expects the simpler measurement requirements and exemptions in IFRS 16 to alleviate many of the concerns that were received in response to the single model proposed in the 2010 Exposure Draft.</p></body></paragraph>
