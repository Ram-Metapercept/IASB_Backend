Accordingly, the lessor has an unconditional right to receive lease payments (the lease receivable). The lessor controls that right—for example, it can decide to sell or securitise that right. The right arises from past events (not only the commitment to the lease contract but also the underlying asset being made available for use by the lessee) and is expected to result in future economic benefits (typically cash from the lessee) flowing to the lessor.</p></body></paragraph>
