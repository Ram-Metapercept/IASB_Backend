In other words, the weighting should reflect the leasehold interest in the land element and the buildings element of the lease at the inception date. In the extreme case that a building is fully depreciated over the lease term, the lease payments would need to be weighted to provide a return plus the full depreciation of the building’s value at the inception of the lease. The leasehold interest in the land would, assuming a residual value that equals its value at the inception of the lease, have a weighting that reflects only a return on the initial investment.
