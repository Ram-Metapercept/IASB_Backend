The IASB concluded that a customer is unlikely to have the right to control the use of a capacity portion of a larger asset if that portion is not physically distinct (for example, if it is a 20 per cent capacity portion of a pipeline). The customer is unlikely to have the right to control the use of its portion because decisions about the use of the asset are typically made at the larger asset level. Widening the notion of an identified asset to possibly capture portions of a larger asset that are not physically distinct might have forced entities to consider whether they lease assets used to fulfil any contract for services, only to conclude that they do not. Consequently, the IASB concluded that widening the definition to include capacity portions of a larger asset would increase complexity for little benefit.</p></body></paragraph>
