Mr Zhang notes that paragraph BC100 states that ‘at the time of reaching decisions about the exemption in 2015, the IASB had in mind leases of underlying assets with a value, when new, in the order of magnitude of US$5,000 or less.’ Mr Zhang does not think that this reference to US$5,000 is appropriate. He notes that the same asset, when new, can have a different value in different markets, and that the value of a particular asset, when new, can change over time. Moreover, many countries or regions use different currencies, and exchange rates for those currencies change over time. Mr Zhang acknowledges that the exemption is optional and, thus, that entities are not required to apply the exemption. Nonetheless, Mr Zhang is of the view that stating a quantitative amount based on a particular currency may cause difficulties in applying the exemption among entities in different jurisdictions over time.</p></body></paragraph>
