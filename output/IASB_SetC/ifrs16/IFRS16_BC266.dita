In reaching this decision, the IASB considered requiring the sale element of the transaction (ie the sale of the underlying asset) to be accounted for applying <xref href="../ifrs14/IFRS15_TOC.dita#IFRS15_TOC0001" base="F47963246" id="IFRS16_X1117" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 15</xref> because, from a legal standpoint, the seller-lessee will often have sold the entire underlying asset to the buyer-lessor. However, from an economic standpoint, the seller-lessee has sold only its interest in the value of the underlying asset at the end of the leaseback—it has retained its right to use the asset for the duration of the leaseback. The seller-lessee had already obtained that right to use the asset at the time that it purchased the asset—the right of use is an embedded part of the rights that an entity obtains when it purchases, for example, an item of property, plant and equipment. Accordingly, in the IASB’s view, recognising the gain that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor appropriately reflects the economics of the transaction.</p></body></paragraph>
