In defining lease modifications, the IASB differentiated between scenarios resulting in the remeasurement of existing lease assets and lease liabilities that are not lease modifications (for example, a change in lease term resulting from the exercise of an option to extend the lease when that option was not included in the original lease term) and those resulting in a lease modification (for example, a change in the lease term resulting from changes to the terms and conditions of the original lease).</p></body></paragraph>
