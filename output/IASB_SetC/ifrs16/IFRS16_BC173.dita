This is because the IASB views a purchase option as effectively the ultimate option to extend the lease term. A lessee that has an option to extend a lease for all of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset is, economically, in a similar position to a lessee that has an option to purchase the underlying asset. Accordingly, the IASB concluded that, for the same reasons underlying the decision to include extension options, including the exercise price within the measurement of a lease liability if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the option provides the most useful information to users of financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
