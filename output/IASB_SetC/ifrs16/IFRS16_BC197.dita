This approach would treat translation adjustments as an update to the cost of the right-of-use asset, which is initially measured on the basis of the initial measurement of the lease liability. These stakeholders are of the view that lease payments denominated in a foreign currency are in effect another form of variable lease payment, and should be accounted for similarly to variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate. These stakeholders also questioned whether useful information will be obscured as a result of the profit or loss volatility that might arise as a result of recognising foreign currency exchange differences on a lessee’s lease liability in profit or loss.</p></body></paragraph>
