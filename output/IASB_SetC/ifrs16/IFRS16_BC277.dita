Although such an approach would be the least costly for preparers to apply, the information provided would not be beneficial for users of financial statements, particularly for entities that enter into long-term operating leases. For example, some entities enter into operating leases with lease terms of 20 to 30 years. For such entities, a user would not obtain the full benefits of IFRS 16 or full comparability of lease accounting for up to 30 years after implementing the new requirements, because the accounting for leases during that period would not be consistent. This is because right-of-use assets and lease liabilities would not be recognised for leases that were previously classified as operating leases applying IAS 17.</p></body></paragraph>
