Any non-cancellable period or notice period in a lease would meet the definition of a contract and, thus, would be included as part of the lease term. To be part of a contract, any options to extend or terminate the lease that are included in the lease term must also be enforceable; for example the lessee must be able to enforce its right to extend the lease beyond the non-cancellable period. If optional periods are not enforceable, for example, if the lessee cannot enforce the extension of the lease without the agreement of the lessor, the lessee does not have the right to use the asset beyond the non-cancellable period. Consequently, by definition, there is no contract beyond the non-cancellable period (plus any notice period) if there are no enforceable rights and obligations existing between the lessee and lessor beyond that term. In assessing the enforceability of a contract, an entity should consider whether the lessor can refuse to agree to a request from the lessee to extend the lease.</p></body></paragraph>
