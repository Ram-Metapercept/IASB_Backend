On the basis of this fieldwork, the IASB observed that, in most cases, assets and liabilities arising from leases within the scope of the exemption would not be material, even in aggregate. The IASB considered whether these findings demonstrated that the exemption would be of limited benefit to lessees because most leases that would be within its scope might instead be excluded from the recognition requirements of <xref href="IFRS16_TOC.dita#IFRS16_TOC0001" base="F47962390" id="IFRS16_X0873" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 16</xref> by applying the concept of materiality in the <ph class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph></ph> and in <xref href="../ias01/IAS01_TOC.dita#IAS01_TOC0001" base="F47962391" id="IFRS16_X0875" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 1</xref>. However, in the light of feedback received from preparers of financial statements, the IASB concluded that the exemption would provide substantial cost relief to many lessees (and, in particular, smaller entities) by removing the burden of justifying that such leases would not be material in the aggregate.</p></body></paragraph>
