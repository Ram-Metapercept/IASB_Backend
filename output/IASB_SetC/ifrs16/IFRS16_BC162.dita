If the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined, then the lessee should use its incremental borrowing rate. In reaching this decision, the IASB decided to define the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate to take into account the terms and conditions of the lease. The IASB noted that, depending on the nature of the underlying asset and the terms and conditions of the lease, a lessee may be able to refer to a rate that is readily observable as a starting point when determining its incremental borrowing rate for a lease (for example, the rate that a lessee has paid, or would pay, to borrow money to purchase the type of asset being leased, or the property yield when determining the discount rate to apply to property leases). Nonetheless, a lessee should adjust such observable rates as is needed to determine its incremental borrowing rate as defined in IFRS 16.</p></body></paragraph>
