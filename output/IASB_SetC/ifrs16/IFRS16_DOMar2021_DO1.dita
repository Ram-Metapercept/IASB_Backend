They are concerned that an extension to the period during which the       practical expedient is available will further impede comparability between lessees that apply       the practical expedient and those that do not. They note that support from users of financial       statements for <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions</ph></ph> (the 2020 amendment) was predicated on       limiting the practical expedient to a specific time frame that the amendment will extend by 12       months. They also note that one key reason the Board developed the 2020 amendment was because,       at that time, lessees were applying IFRS 16 for the first time and that this is no longer the       case.</p></body></paragraph>
