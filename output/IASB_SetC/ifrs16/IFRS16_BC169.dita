For some Board members, this decision was made solely for cost-benefit reasons. Those Board members were of the view that all variable lease payments meet the definition of a liability for the lessee. However, they were persuaded by the feedback received from stakeholders that the costs of including variable lease payments linked to future performance or use would outweigh the benefits, particularly because of the concerns expressed about the high level of measurement uncertainty that would result from including them and the high volume of leases held by some lessees. Other Board members did not think that variable lease payments linked to future performance or use meet the definition of a liability for the lessee until the performance or use occurs. They regarded those payments to be avoidable by the lessee and, accordingly, concluded that the lessee does not have a present obligation to make those payments at the commencement date. In addition, variable lease payments linked to future performance or use could be viewed as a means by which the lessee and lessor can share future economic benefits to be derived from use of the asset.</p></body></paragraph>
