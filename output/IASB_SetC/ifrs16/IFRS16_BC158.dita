In such cases, a lessee considers how the arrangement is most faithfully represented in the financial statements. For example, a lease contract might contain a set of options that results in:</p><ol outputclass="static" id="IFRS16_L0139" base="F45931557" type="lower-alpha" class="- topic/ol "><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS16_P2091" base="F45931558" class="- topic/p ">a choice for the lessee that represents an in-substance fixed payment. This might be the case, for example, if a lessee has the choice of either exercising an option to extend a lease or purchasing the underlying asset. The set of payments that aggregate to the lowest amount (on a discounted basis) from the available realistic options is the minimum amount that the lessee is obliged to pay. In the IASB’s view, this minimum amount is an in-substance fixed payment that should be recognised as part of the cost of the right-of-use asset and as a liability by the lessee (see <xref href="IFRS16_gB42-B42.dita#IFRS16_gB42_B42/IFRS16_gB42_B42_TI" id="IFRS16_X0952" base="F47962693" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph B42(c) of IFRS 16</xref>).</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS16_P2092" base="F45931560" class="- topic/p ">a choice for the lessee that represents a guarantee provided to the lessor under which the lessee guarantees the lessor a minimum or fixed cash return regardless of whether an option is exercised. Such a situation might occur, for example, if an extension option is associated with a residual value guarantee or a termination penalty under which the lessor is guaranteed to receive an economic inflow at least equivalent to the payments that would be made by the lessee during the optional period. In the IASB’s view, such an arrangement creates an economic incentive for the lessee to exercise the option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease (see <xref href="IFRS16_B38.dita#IFRS16_B38" id="IFRS16_X0953" base="F47962694" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph B38 of IFRS 16</xref>).</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
