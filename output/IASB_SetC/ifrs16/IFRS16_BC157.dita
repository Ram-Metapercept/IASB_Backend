The IASB observed that applying the concept of ‘reasonably certain’ requires judgement and, therefore, also decided to provide application guidance in <xref href="IFRS16_TOC.dita#IFRS16_TOC0001" base="F47962692" id="IFRS16_X0950" class="- topic/xref ">IFRS 16</xref> to help entities to apply this concept.  Accordingly, when initially determining the lease term, an entity should consider all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the lessee to exercise that option.

For example, within the context of property leases, the IASB noted the relevance of considering the costs of finding a new location at the end of the non-cancellable period and of relocating to that new location, or the importance of the location (for example, a head office or a flagship store) to the lessee.</p></li><li class="- topic/li "><li_value class="+ topic/ph ifrs-d/li_value ">(b)</li_value> <p base="F45931554" id="IFRS16_P2089" class="- topic/p ">to reduce the risk of non-substantive break clauses being inserted within contracts solely to reduce the lease term beyond what is economically reasonable for the lessee.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
