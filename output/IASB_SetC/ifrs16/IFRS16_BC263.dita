In particular, they questioned the rationale for having a higher threshold for sale accounting in a sale and leaseback transaction than for any other sale. Some were also of the view that different thresholds for achieving sale accounting in IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 would not be operational. The IASB also noted that some of the structuring concerns relating to sale and operating leaseback transactions that had existed under IAS 17 would be substantially reduced by the lessee accounting model in IFRS 16, which requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by the seller-lessee.</p></body></paragraph>
