The Boards confirmed their previous decision that a lessee should be required to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases (with limited exceptions). However, the Boards reached different decisions with respect to the expense recognition model. For the reasons described in <xref href="IFRS16_gBC41-BC56.dita#IFRS16_gBC41_BC56/IFRS16_gBC41_BC56_TI" id="IFRS16_X0774" base="F47961971" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC41–BC56</xref>, the IASB decided to adopt a single lessee accounting model in which a lessee would account for all leases as providing finance. In the light of all of the feedback received, the IASB is of the view that this model provides the most useful information to the broadest range of users of financial statements. The IASB thinks that the model also addresses many of the concerns raised by stakeholders about cost and complexity, and the concerns raised about the conceptual basis of the dual model proposed in the 2013 Exposure Draft (see <xref href="IFRS16_BC45.dita#IFRS16_BC45" id="IFRS16_X0775" base="F47961972" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC45</xref>). In contrast, the FASB decided to adopt a dual lessee expense recognition model, classifying leases in a similar manner to the previous US GAAP requirements for distinguishing between operating leases and capital leases. In making these decisions, the Boards observed that, for lessees with a portfolio of leases starting and ending at different times, any difference in reported profit or loss between IFRS and US GAAP is not expected to be significant for many lessees.</p></body></paragraph>
