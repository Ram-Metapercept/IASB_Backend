The IASB’s fieldwork suggested that the aggregate value is most likely to be material for large assets made up of a number of individual leases of low-value assets (such as IT equipment made up of individually low-value component parts). Consequently, the IASB decided that if an underlying asset is highly dependent on, or highly interrelated with, other underlying assets, a lessee should not apply the recognition exemption to the lease of that individual asset. Similarly, the IASB decided that a lessee should not apply the recognition exemption to a lease of an underlying asset if the lessee cannot benefit from that underlying asset on its own or together with other readily available resources, irrespective of the value of that underlying asset.</p></body></paragraph>
