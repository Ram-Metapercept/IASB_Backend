The IASB concluded that this risk is mitigated by the economic consequences of a short-term lease for a lessor. There would often be an economic disincentive for lessors to grant shorter term leases, because shortening the lease term would increase the risk associated with a lessor’s residual interest in the underlying asset. Consequently, the IASB is of the view that a lessor would often either demand increased lease payments from the lessee to compensate for this change in risk or refuse to shorten the non-cancellable period of the lease. In addition, the IASB noted the rigour that lessees are expected to apply when determining the lease term, as described in <xref href="IFRS16_B37.dita#IFRS16_B37" id="IFRS16_X0862" base="F47962341" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs B37–B40 of IFRS 16</xref>. This should reduce the risk of non-substantive break clauses being inserted within contracts solely for accounting purposes. The IASB also decided that a lessee should reassess the lease term of a short-term lease by treating it as a new lease if that lease term changes.</p></body></paragraph>
