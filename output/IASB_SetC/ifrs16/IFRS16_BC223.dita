The IASB thinks that users of financial statements would find information about the maturities of any contractual commitments of an entity useful, regardless of the nature of the entity’s rights under the contract. However, the IASB noted that it could be misleading to require the disclosure of contractual commitments for services that are embedded within a lease without also requiring the disclosure of contractual commitments for services that are provided as part of other contracts. The IASB decided that adding such a disclosure requirement would be beyond the scope of the Leases project.</p></body></paragraph>
