That would require a lessee to look to the terms and conditions agreed to in the contract at the inception date (which could be before the commencement date). However, if the inception date was considered to be the date of initial measurement, that could result in a lessee recognising a gain or loss relating to changes between the dates of inception and commencement when recognising lease assets and lease liabilities at the commencement date. Therefore, the IASB decided to align the date of recognition with the date of initial measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.</p></body></paragraph>
