Some stakeholders were of the view that payments to be made during future optional periods do not meet the definition of a liability for the lessee (or an asset for the lessor) until those options are exercised. This is because, before the exercise date, a lessee can avoid those payments by choosing to exercise a termination option or not to exercise an extension option. These stakeholders suggested limiting the lease term to the contractually committed period, ie the non-cancellable period. In addition, some stakeholders expressed concerns that including future optional periods within the lease term would not distinguish between, for example, a five-year non-cancellable lease and a three-year lease with an option to extend for two years. In their view, an entity with a five-year non-cancellable lease is in a different economic position from an entity with a three-year lease with an option to extend for two years that may or may not be exercised.</p></body></paragraph>
