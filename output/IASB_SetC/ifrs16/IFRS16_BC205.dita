This approach would require a lessee to account for the lease modification as (a) a new lease, when the change represents a substantial modification; or (b) a continuation of the original lease, when the change does not represent a substantial modification. However, the IASB did not adopt this approach because, as a result of the link to the right-of-use asset, it could result in outcomes that would not faithfully represent the differing nature of each of those changes. For example, there are scenarios in which this approach would result in the extinguishment of the original lease (and the recognition of a corresponding gain or loss in profit or loss) when the lessee continues to have all of the rights it had in the original lease after the modification.</p></body></paragraph>
