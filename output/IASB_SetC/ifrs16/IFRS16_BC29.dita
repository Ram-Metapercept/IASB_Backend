However, in the IASB’s view, there is no outflow of economic benefits (other than incidental costs) from the lessee when it returns the leased item, because the lessee does not control the economic benefits associated with the asset that it returns to the lessor. Even if the lessee has physical possession of the underlying asset, it has no right to obtain the remaining economic benefits associated with the underlying asset once the lease term expires (ignoring any options to extend the lease or purchase the underlying asset). Once it reaches the end of the lease term, the position of the lessee is like that of an asset custodian. The lessee is holding an asset on behalf of a third party, the lessor, but has no right to the economic benefits embodied in that asset at the end of the lease term.</p></body></paragraph>
