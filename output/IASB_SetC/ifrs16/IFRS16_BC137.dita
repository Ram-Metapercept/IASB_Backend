The IASB acknowledged that the stand-alone price of lease and non-lease components might not be readily available and, consequently, decided to permit the use of estimates, maximising the use of observable information.  In the IASB’s view, the use of estimated stand-alone prices by a lessee, if observable prices are not readily available, addresses some of the most significant concerns raised by both lessors and lessees with respect to the separation of lease and non-lease components: lessors had expressed concerns about providing pricing information to lessees and lessees had expressed concerns that obtaining observable stand-alone pricing information that is not readily available could be onerous and costly. The IASB also observed that applying the previous requirements in IAS 17, a lessee had been required to allocate the consideration in a contract between lease and non-lease components using estimates of the relative fair value of those components. The IASB was not aware of any significant practical difficulties in applying those requirements.</p></body></paragraph>
