This approach is consistent with the requirements in <xref href="../ias07/IAS07_TOC0001.dita#IAS07_TOC0001" id="IFRS16_X1014" base="F47962879" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 7 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Statement of Cash Flows</ph></ph></xref> for cash flows relating to financial liabilities and provides comparability between interest paid on leases and interest paid on other financial liabilities. This approach also results in a lessee accounting for a lease consistently in the balance sheet, income statement and statement of cash flows. For example, a lessee (a) measures and presents the lease liability similarly to other financial liabilities; (b) recognises and presents interest relating to that liability in a similar manner to interest on other financial liabilities; and (c) presents cash paid relating to interest on lease liabilities similarly to interest on other financial liabilities.</p></body></paragraph>
