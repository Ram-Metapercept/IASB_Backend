However, it was noted that similar difficulties are encountered when measuring the fair value less costs to sell of the produce growing in the ground. Consequently, the Board decided that it would be inconsistent to provide additional relief from fair value measurement for produce growing on a bearer plant and not also for other biological assets within the scope of IAS 41. The Board observed that if preparers encounter significant practical difficulties on initial measurement of produce, they should consider whether they meet the requirements of the exemptions in <xref href="IAS41_10.dita#IAS41_10" id="IAS41_X0252" base="F35270101" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs 10(c)</xref> and <xref href="IAS41_30.dita#IAS41_30" id="IAS41_X0253" base="F35270160" class="- topic/xref ">30 of IAS 41</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
