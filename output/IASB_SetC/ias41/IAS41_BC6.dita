Those incremental cash flows would be reduced by expected income tax payments using appropriate tax rates (ie the tax rate of a market participant buyer). Accordingly, fair value takes into account future income taxes that a market participant purchasing the asset (or assuming the liability) would be expected to pay (or to receive), without regard to an entity’s specific tax situation.<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS41_FN0009" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/></p></body></paragraph>
