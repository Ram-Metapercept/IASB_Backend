However, the Board decided to indicate that an entity uses all available market‑determined prices or values since otherwise there is a possibility that entities may opt to use present value of expected net cash flows from the asset even when useful market‑determined prices or values are available. Of the 20 companies that responded to the questionnaire, six companies used present value of expected net cash flows as a basis of fair value measurement and, in addition, two companies indicated that it was impossible to measure their biological assets reliably since the present value of expected net cash flows would not be reliable (as they would need to use present value as a basis).</p></body></paragraph>
