Paragraph 21 could be read to exclude from such calculations increases in cash flows arising from ‘additional biological transformation’. Diversity in practice had developed from different interpretations of this requirement. The Board decided that not including these cash flows resulted in a carrying amount that is not representative of the asset’s fair value. The Board noted that an entity should consider the risks associated with cash flows from ‘additional biological transformation’ in determining the expected cash flows, the discount rate, or some combination of the two. Therefore, the Board decided to amend IAS 41 to remove the prohibition on an entity taking into account the cash flows resulting from ‘additional biological transformation’ when estimating the fair value of a biological asset.<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS41_FN0010" type="fn" class="- topic/xref "/></p></body></paragraph>
