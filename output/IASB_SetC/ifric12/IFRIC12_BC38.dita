Respondents were concerned that the proposal would require operators with essentially identical cash flow streams to adopt different accounting models. This would impair users’ understanding of entities involved in providing public‑to‑private service concession arrangements. Several gave the example of a shadow toll road and a toll road, where the economics (demand risk) of the arrangements would be similar, pointing out that under the proposals the two arrangements would be accounted for differently. In the light of comments received on the proposals, the IFRIC decided to clarify (see <xref href="IFRIC12_g15-19.dita#IFRIC12_g15_19/IFRIC12_g15_19_TI" id="IFRIC12_X0307" base="F1800427" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs 15–19</xref>) the extent to which an operator should recognise a financial asset and an intangible asset.</p></body></paragraph>
