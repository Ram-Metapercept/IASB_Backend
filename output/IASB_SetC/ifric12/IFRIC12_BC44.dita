Before the grantor is required to pay the operator for its construction services, the operator may have to ensure that the infrastructure is capable of generating the public services specified by the grantor or that the infrastructure is up to or exceeds operating standards or efficiency targets specified by the grantor to ensure a specified level of service and capacity can be delivered. In this respect the operator’s position is the same as that of any other entity in which payment for goods or services is contingent on subsequent performance of the goods or service sold.</p></body></paragraph>
