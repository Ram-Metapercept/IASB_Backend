The IFRIC concluded that it would not, because the definition of a derivative in IAS 39 requires, among other things, that the variable is not specific to a party to the contract. The consequence is that the contract’s provision for variations in payments does not meet the definition of a derivative and, accordingly, the requirements of <xref href="../ias39/IAS39_TOC.dita" base="F1800557" id="IFRIC12_X0339" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 39</xref> in relation to embedded derivatives do not apply. The IFRIC observed that if the amount to be received by the operator is conditional on the infrastructure meeting quality or performance or efficiency targets as described in <xref href="IFRIC12_BC44.dita#IFRIC12_BC44" base="F1800558" id="IFRIC12_X0340" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph BC44</xref>, this would not prevent the amount from being classified as a financial asset. The IFRIC also concluded that during the construction phase of the arrangement the operator’s asset (representing its accumulating right to be paid for providing construction services) should be classified as a financial asset when it represents cash or another financial asset due from or at the direction of the grantor.</p></body></paragraph>
