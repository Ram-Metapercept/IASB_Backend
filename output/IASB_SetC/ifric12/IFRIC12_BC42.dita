The operator has a contractual right to receive cash for the construction services if the grantor contractually guarantees the operator’s cash flows, in the manner described in <xref href="IFRIC12_16.dita#IFRIC12_16" id="IFRIC12_X0311" base="F1800433" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 16</xref>. The IFRIC noted that the operator has an unconditional right to receive cash to the extent that the grantor bears the risk (demand risk) that the cash flows generated by the users of the public service will not be sufficient to recover the operator’s investment.</p></body></paragraph>
