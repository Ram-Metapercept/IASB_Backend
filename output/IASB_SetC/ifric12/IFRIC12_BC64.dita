However, the IFRIC concluded that there was nothing unique about these intangible assets that would justify use of a method of depreciation different from that used for other intangible assets. The IFRIC noted that <xref href="../ias38/IAS38_98.dita#IAS38_98" id="IFRIC12_X0348" base="F32051011" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 98 of IAS 38</xref> provides for a number of amortisation methods for intangible assets with finite useful lives. These methods include the straight‑line method, the diminishing balance method and the units of production method. The method used is selected on the basis of the expected pattern of consumption of the expected future economic benefits embodied in the asset and is applied consistently from period to period, unless there is a change in the expected pattern of consumption of those future economic benefits.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
