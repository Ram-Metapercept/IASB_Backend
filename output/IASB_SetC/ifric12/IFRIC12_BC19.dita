Respondents argued, and the IFRIC agreed, that the significant residual interest criterion would limit the usefulness of the guidance because a service arrangement for the entire physical life of the infrastructure would be excluded from the scope of the guidance. That result was not the IFRIC’s intention. In its redeliberation of the proposals, the IFRIC decided that it would not retain the proposal that the residual interest in the infrastructure handed over to the grantor at the end of the arrangement must be significant. As a consequence, ‘whole of life’ infrastructure (ie where the infrastructure is used in a public‑to‑private service arrangement for the entirety of its useful life) is within the scope of the Interpretation.</p></body></paragraph>
