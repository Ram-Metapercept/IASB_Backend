In particular, it noted the views expressed by some respondents that the contractual terms of certain service arrangements would be regarded as leases under IFRIC 4 and would also be regarded as meeting the scope criterion set out in <xref href="IFRIC12_5.dita#IFRIC12_5" base="F1800357" id="IFRIC12_X0283" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 5</xref> of IFRIC 12. The IFRIC did not regard the choice between accounting treatments as appropriate because it could lead to different accounting treatments for contracts that have similar economic effects. In the light of comments received the IFRIC amended the scope of IFRIC 4 to specify that if a service arrangement met the scope requirements of IFRIC 12 it would not be within the scope of <ph class="- topic/ph ">IFRIC 4</ph>.</p></body></paragraph>
