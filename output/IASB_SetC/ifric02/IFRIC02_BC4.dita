This was followed by a series of meetings between IASB members and staff and representatives of the European Association of Co‑operative Banks. After considering questions raised by the bank group, the IASB concluded that the principles articulated in IAS 32 should not be modified, but that there were questions about the application of those principles to co‑operative entities that should be considered by the IFRIC.</p></body></paragraph>
