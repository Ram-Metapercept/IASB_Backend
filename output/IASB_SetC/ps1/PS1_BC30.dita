For example, in the United Kingdom the Companies Act 2006 requires a business review as part of the directors’ report. For quoted companies, the requirements are reflected in the UK Accounting Standards Board’s (ASB’s) OFR Reporting Statement, which recommends that an OFR should be the analysis by the directors. Furthermore, it is the directors who are responsible for approving the business review or OFR. There are similar requirements in Canada, France and Germany.
