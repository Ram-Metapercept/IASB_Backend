In that example, management could provide forward‑looking information by explaining management’s objectives and strategies for remedying the plan deficit. These strategies might include a planned future increase in contributions, changes in investment strategy or changes to the plan. Management could also provide an explanation of how general market trends or other risks might affect the deficit and the strategies of management for remedying the deficit. This disclosure could include some quantitative information, but it is not necessarily a forecast or a projection.</p></body></paragraph>
