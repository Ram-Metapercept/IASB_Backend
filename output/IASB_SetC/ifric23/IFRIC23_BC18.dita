The Committee observed that the inclusion of a third method would have complicated the judgements that need to be made in applying the Interpretation. This is because an entity would have had to assess which of three measurement methods best predicts the resolution of the uncertainty. The Committee also noted that IFRS Standards do not use the cumulative-probability approach, whereas the expected value and the most likely amount are used elsewhere in the Standards. Including a measurement method not used elsewhere in the Standards might have reduced comparability.</p></body></paragraph>
