The IFRIC noted that this approach is different from the restate/translate approach under IFRSs.

APB Statement No. 3 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Financial Statements Restated for General Price‑Level Changes</ph></ph> is also based on a restatement approach, and would require retrospective application, as under <xref href="../ias29/IAS29_TOC0001.dita#IAS29_TOC0001" base="F77792336" id="IFRIC07_X0071" class="- topic/xref ">IAS 29</xref>.

Furthermore, the Board noted that in the prior year, the relevant amounts had been already expressed in the non‑hyperinflationary presentation currency, and there was no reason to change them.</p>     </lq></body></paragraph>
