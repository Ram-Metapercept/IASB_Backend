They believed that, once an entity declared a distribution to its owners, it had a contractual obligation to distribute the assets to its owners. However, IAS 39 would not cover dividends payable if they were considered to be non‑contractual obligations. In addition, IAS 39 covers some but not all obligations that require an entity to deliver non‑cash assets to another entity. It does not cover a liability to distribute non‑financial assets to owners. The IFRIC therefore concluded that it was not appropriate to conclude that all dividends payable should be within the scope of IAS 39.</p></body></paragraph>
