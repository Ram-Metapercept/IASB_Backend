The IFRIC also noted that the principle on when to recognise a dividend was in the wrong place within the IASB’s authoritative documents. The Board agreed with the IFRIC’s conclusions and amended IAS 10 as part of its approval of the Interpretation. The Board confirmed that this Interpretation had not changed the principle on when to recognise a dividend payable; however, the principle was moved from IAS 10 into the Interpretation and clarified but without changing the principle.</p></body></paragraph>
