The Board acknowledged             that because the complexity of accounting required for particular transactions, other             events or conditions is ultimately a subjective question, an entity will need to judge             whether the relevant accounting is complex. However, the Board concluded that the             guidance in the amendments would be sufficient for an entity, auditors, regulators and             others to make appropriate judgements about the materiality of such information.</p></body></paragraph>
