In her view,             investors are responsible for ensuring that their economic decisions are derived from a             proper and knowledgeable understanding of an entity’s financial statements, which             includes understanding the requirements of IFRS Standards. IFRS Standards should be             regarded as public knowledge in a financial reporting environment. No mere recitation of             the words from the IFRS Standards can meet the definition of material without stretching             that definition endlessly. In Ms Flores’ view, improving users’ understanding of the             requirements in IFRS Standards should be achieved through education by the IFRS             Foundation. Such an objective should not be achieved by amending the requirements of             IFRS Standards.</p></body></paragraph>
