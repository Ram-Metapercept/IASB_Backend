Instead, it thinks that the order listed was intended to provide an       example of how an entity could order the notes and that the term normal was not meant to       imply that alternative ordering of the notes is ‘abnormal’. The Board       therefore amended IAS 1 to clarify that the order listed in paragraph 114 is an example of       how an entity could order or group its notes in a systematic manner. The Board also made       amendments to clarify that significant accounting policies<xref type="fn" keyref="footnotes/IAS01_BC76C_BC76F_FN0001" class="- topic/xref "/> do not need to be disclosed in one note, but       instead can be included with related information in other notes.</p>   </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
