However, the Board did not do this because it concluded that using       ‘would’ would be a substantive change that might have unintended       consequences. For example, ‘would influence decisions’ might be interpreted as       a presumption that information is not material unless it can be proved       otherwise, ie for information to be seen as material it would be necessary to       prove that the information would influence the decisions of users of the       financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
