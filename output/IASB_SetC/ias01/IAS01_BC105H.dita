Paragraph 15 explains that the application of IFRS Standards, with additional disclosure when necessary, is presumed to result in financial statements that achieve fair presentation. Revisions of the <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">Conceptual Framework</i> will not automatically lead to changes in IFRS Standards.

The objective did not change substantively—it is an adapted and updated version of the objective of financial statements from the <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">Framework</i> and paragraph 9 of IAS 1.

The Board concluded that this is unlikely to lead to changes in applying the requirements of IAS 1 because the definitions of income and expenses in the 2018 <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">Conceptual Framework</i> were updated only to align them with the revised definitions of an asset and a liability. Moreover, the main purpose of paragraph 89 is to indicate that particular items of income or expenses can be recognised outside profit or loss only if required by other IFRS Standards.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
