However, some respondents suggested that the Board should use the term ‘recycling’, rather than ‘reclassification’ as the former term is more common. The Board concluded that both terms are similar in meaning, but decided to use the term ‘reclassification adjustment’ to converge with the terminology used in SFAS 130.</p></body></paragraph>
