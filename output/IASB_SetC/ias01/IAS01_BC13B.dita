That       feedback indicated that some entities apply the disclosure requirements in IFRS       Standards mechanically, using them as a checklist for disclosures in their       financial statements, rather than applying their judgement to determine what       information is material. Some entities have said that it is easier to use a       checklist approach than to apply judgement because of management resource       constraints, and because following a mechanical approach means that their       judgement is less likely to be challenged by auditors, regulators or users of their       financial statements. Similarly, some entities say that they prefer to be cautious       when deciding whether to omit disclosures to avoid the risk of being challenged       by these parties.</p></body></paragraph>
