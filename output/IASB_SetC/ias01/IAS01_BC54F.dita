The arguments used by those objecting were much the same as those received on the discussion paper. However, many respondents, regardless of their views on the proposed amendments, said that the Board should establish a conceptual basis for what should be presented in OCI. Those opposed to a continuous statement cited OCI’s lack of a conceptual definition and therefore believed that OCI should not be presented in close proximity to profit or loss because this would confuse users. However, users generally said that the lack of a conceptual framework made it difficult to distinguish the underlying economics of items reported in profit or loss (net income) from items reported in other comprehensive income. Although users also asked for a conceptual framework for OCI, most supported the notion of a single statement of comprehensive income.</p></body></paragraph>
