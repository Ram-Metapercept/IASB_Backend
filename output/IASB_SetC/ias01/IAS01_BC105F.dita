However, the Board removed this requirement and stated in the transition provisions that an entity need not disclose the fact that it has applied these amendments (regardless of whether the amendments have been applied for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016 or if they have been applied early). This is because the Board considers that these amendments are clarifying amendments that do not directly affect an entity’s accounting policies or accounting estimates. Similarly, an entity does not need to disclose the information required by paragraphs 28–30 of IAS 8 in relation to these amendments. The Board noted that if an entity decides to change its accounting policies as a result of applying these amendments then it would be required to follow the existing requirements in IAS 8 in relation to those accounting policy changes.</p></body></paragraph>
