Those respondents said that in addition to addressing the conceptual basis for the split between profit or loss and OCI the Board should set principles for which OCI items should be reclassified (recycled) to profit or loss and when they should be reclassified. The Board acknowledges that it has not set out a conceptual basis for how it determines whether an item should be presented in OCI or in profit or loss. It also agrees that it has not set out principles to determine whether items should be reclassified to profit or loss. Those matters were not within the scope of this project, which focused on presentation, and therefore the Board has not addressed them at this time. However, the Board is consulting on its future agenda, which could lead to those matters becoming part of the work programme.</p></body></paragraph>
