The Board noted that an investor’s share of other comprehensive income of associates or joint ventures is after tax and non-controlling interests of the associate or joint venture, as illustrated in the Guidance on Implementing IAS 1. It also noted that the disclosure requirements in paragraphs 90–91 do not apply to the tax of the associate or joint venture that is already reflected in the investor’s share of other comprehensive income of the associate or joint venture. However, the Board noted that if the investor itself is liable for tax in respect of its share of other comprehensive income of the associate or joint venture, then paragraphs 90–91 would apply to this tax. Therefore, the Board decided not to add additional guidance to IAS 1 on this topic.</p></body></paragraph>
