Disaggregation is often used to describe the process of expanding totals, subtotals and line items into further items that themselves may reflect the aggregated results of transactions or other events. Because the process of expanding totals, subtotals and line items is more likely to increase the transparency of information rather than obscuring it, the Board decided not to include the term disaggregation in paragraph 30A of IAS 1. In addition, the Board was of the view that items resulting from the process of disaggregation that themselves reflect the aggregated results of transactions would be covered by paragraphs 29–31 of IAS 1.</p></body></paragraph>
