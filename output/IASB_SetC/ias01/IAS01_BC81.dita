These assumptions and other sources of estimation uncertainty relate to estimates that require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgements. Therefore, disclosure in accordance with <xref href="IAS01_125.dita#IAS01_125" id="IAS01_X0981" base="F4756642" class="- topic/xref ">paragraph 125</xref> of the revised IAS 1 would be made in respect of relatively few assets or liabilities (or classes of them).</p></body></paragraph>
