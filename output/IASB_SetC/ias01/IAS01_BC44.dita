The granting of a waiver or a period of grace changes the terms of the loan agreement. Therefore, an entity’s receipt from the lender, after the balance sheet date, of a waiver or a period of grace of at least twelve months does not change the nature of the liability to non‑current until it occurs.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
