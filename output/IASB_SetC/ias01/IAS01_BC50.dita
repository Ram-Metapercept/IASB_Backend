Many respondents agreed with the Board’s proposal to maintain the two‑statement approach and the single‑statement approach as alternatives and a few urged the Board to mandate one of them. However, most respondents preferred the two‑statement approach because it distinguishes profit or loss and total comprehensive income; they believe that with the two‑statement approach, the ‘income statement’ remains a primary financial statement. Respondents supported the presentation of two separate statements as a transition measure until the Board develops principles to determine the criteria for inclusion of items in profit or loss or in other comprehensive income.</p></body></paragraph>
