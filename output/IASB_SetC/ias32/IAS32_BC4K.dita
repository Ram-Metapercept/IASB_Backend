The Board also noted that long‑dated foreign currency rights issues are not primarily transactions with owners in their capacity as owners. The equal treatment of all owners of the same class of equity instruments was also the basis on which, in <xref href="../ifric17/IFRIC17_TOC0001.dita#IFRIC17_TOC0001" id="IAS32_X0964" base="F16453349" class="- topic/xref ">IFRIC 17 <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Distributions of Non‑cash Assets to Owners</ph></ph></xref>, the IFRIC distinguished non‑reciprocal distributions to owners from exchange transactions. The fact that the rights are distributed pro rata to existing shareholders is critical to the Board’s conclusion to provide an exception to the ‘fixed for fixed’ concept in IAS 32 as this is a narrow targeted transaction with owners in their capacity as owners.</p></body></paragraph>
