As discussed further in <xref href="IAS32_BC6.dita#IAS32_BC6" id="IAS32_X0958" base="F16453311" class="- topic/xref ">paragraphs BC6–BC15</xref>, the Board decided to preclude equity classification for such contracts when they (a) involve an obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the entity, (b) in the case of a non‑derivative, are not for the receipt or delivery of a fixed number of shares or (c) in the case of a derivative, are not for the exchange of a fixed number of shares for a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset. The Board also decided to preclude equity classification for contracts that are derivatives on derivatives on an entity’s own equity. Consistently with this decision, the Board also decided to amend the definitions of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument in IAS 32 to make them consistent with the guidance about contracts on an entity’s own equity instruments. The Board did not reconsider other aspects of the definitions as part of this project to revise IAS 32, for example the other changes to the definitions proposed by the Joint Working Group in its Draft Standard <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">Financial Instruments and Similar Items</i> published by the Board’s predecessor body, IASC, in 2000.</p></body></paragraph>
