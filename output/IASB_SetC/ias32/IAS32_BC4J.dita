The Board rejected this argument because of the extremely narrow amendment that requires the entity to treat all of its existing owners of the same class of its own non‑derivative equity instruments equally. The Board also noted that a change in the capital structure of an entity to create a new class of non‑derivative equity instruments would be transparent because of the presentation and disclosure requirements in IFRSs.</p></body></paragraph>
