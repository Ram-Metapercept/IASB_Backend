Establishing a disclosure exemption on such a criterion without a definition of the terms could lead to exempting other transactions with management from being disclosed, because they could all be structured as ‘compensation paid in the ordinary course of an entity’s operations’. Respondents argued that such an exemption could lead to abuse because it could potentially apply to any transactions with management.</p></body></paragraph>
