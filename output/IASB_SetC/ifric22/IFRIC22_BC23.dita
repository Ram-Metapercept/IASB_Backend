The Interpretations Committee observed that <ph class="- topic/ph ">paragraph 4.46 of the <ph outputclass="standard_ref" class="- topic/ph "><ph outputclass="standard_title" class="- topic/ph ">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph></ph> notes that ‘in practice, obligations under contracts that are equally proportionately unperformed (for example, liabilities for inventory ordered but not yet received) are generally not recognised as liabilities in the financial statements’. Consequently, the Interpretations Committee concluded the date on which an entity first recognises the transaction in its financial statements with a value determines the date of the transaction. If an entity recognises a non‑monetary asset or non‑monetary liability arising from advance consideration, the date of initial recognition of that asset or liability is the date of the transaction. The date of initial recognition of the non‑monetary asset or non‑monetary liability is generally the date on which the entity pays or receives the advance consideration.</p></body></paragraph>
