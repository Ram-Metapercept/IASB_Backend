The issue arose in jurisdictions in which securities laws and           regulatory practices require an entity to reissue its previously issued annual financial           statements in connection with an offering document, when the most recently filed interim           financial statements reflect matters that are accounted for retrospectively under the           applicable accounting standards. In these jurisdictions, securities law and regulatory           practices do not require or permit the entity, in its reissued financial statements, to           recognise events or transactions that occur between the time the financial statements were           first authorised for issued and the time the financial statements are reissued, unless the           adjustment is required by national regulation; instead security and regulatory practices           require the entity to recognise in its reissued financial statements only those           adjustments that would ordinarily be made to the comparatives in the following year&#x2019;s           financial statements. These adjustments would include, for example, adjustments for           changes in accounting policy that are applied retrospectively, but would not include           changes in accounting estimates. This approach is called &#x2018;dual dating&#x2019;. The submitter           asked the Interpretations Committee to clarify whether IAS&#xa0;10 permits only one date of           authorisation for issue (ie &#x2018;dual dating&#x2019; is not permitted) when considered within the           context of reissuing previously issued financial statements in connection with an offering           document.</p>         <p outputclass="keep_with_next">The Interpretations Committee noted that the scope of IAS&#xa0;10           is the accounting for, and disclosure of, events after the reporting period and that the           objective of this Standard is to prescribe:</p>         <ol outputclass="static" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>             <p id="IAS10_P0096">when an entity should adjust its financial statements for events               after the reporting period; and</p>           </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>             <p id="IAS10_P0097">the disclosures that an entity should give about the date when the               financial statements were authorised for issue and about events after the reporting               period.</p>           </li></ol>         <p id="IAS10_P0098">The Interpretations Committee also noted that financial statements           prepared in accordance with IAS&#xa0;10 should reflect all adjusting and non-adjusting events           up to the date that the financial statements were authorised for issue.</p>         <p>The Interpretations Committee noted that IAS&#xa0;10 does not address the presentation of           re-issued financial statements in an offering document when the originally issued           financial statements have not been withdrawn, but the re-issued financial statements are           provided either as supplementary information or a re-presentation of the original           financial statements in an offering document in accordance with regulatory           requirements.</p>         <p>On the basis of the above and because the issue arises in multiple jurisdictions, each           with particular securities laws and regulations which may dictate the form for           re-presentations of financial statements, the Interpretations Committee decided not to add           this issue to its agenda.]</p>       </fn><fn base="IAS10_3" id="IAS10_14_EDUFN">         <p outputclass="keep_with_next">[IFRIC&#xae;&#xa0;<i>Update</i>, June 2021, Agenda Decision, &#x2018;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 10</ph>&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_title">Events after the Reporting Period</ph></ph>&#x2014;Preparation           of Financial Statements when an Entity is No Longer a Going Concern&#x2019;</p>         <p outputclass="keep_with_next">The Committee received a request about the accounting           applied by an entity that is no longer a going concern (as described in <xref href="../ias01/IAS01_25.dita#IAS01_25">paragraph 25 of <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 1</ph>               <ph outputclass="standard_title">Presentation of Financial           Statements</ph></ph></xref>).

Paragraph 14 of IAS 10 states that           &#x2018;an entity shall not prepare its financial statements on a going concern basis if           management determines after the reporting period either that it intends to liquidate the           entity or to cease trading, or that it has no realistic alternative but to do so&#x2019;.</p>         <p>Applying paragraph 25 of IAS 1 and paragraph 14 of IAS 10, an entity that is no longer a           going concern cannot prepare financial statements (including those for prior periods that           have not yet been authorised for issue) on a going concern basis.</p>         <p>The Committee therefore concluded that the principles and requirements in IFRS Standards           provide an adequate basis for an entity that is no longer a going concern to determine           whether it prepares its financial statements on a going concern basis.</p>         <p outputclass="keep_with_next" typeface="sansserif">Question II</p>         <p outputclass="keep_with_next">Based on its research, the Committee observed no diversity           in the application of IFRS Standards with respect to Question II.
