Therefore, the transfer of legal title of an asset may indicate that the customer has obtained control of the asset. If an entity retains legal title solely as protection against the customer&#x2019;s failure to pay, those rights of the entity would not preclude the customer from obtaining control of an asset.</p>       </li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value>         <p base="F31712658" id="IFRS15_P0193">The entity has transferred physical possession of the asset&#x2014;the customer&#x2019;s physical possession of an asset may indicate that the customer has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the asset or to restrict the access of other entities to those benefits. However, physical possession may not coincide with control of an asset. For example, in some repurchase agreements and in some consignment arrangements, a customer or consignee may have physical possession of an asset that the entity controls. Conversely, in some bill-and-hold arrangements, the entity may have physical possession of an asset that the customer controls.                      <xref base="F33209237" href="IFRS15_B64.dita#IFRS15_B64" id="IFRS15_X0308">Paragraphs B64&#x2013;B76</xref>, <xref base="F33209269" href="IFRS15_B77.dita#IFRS15_B77" id="IFRS15_X0309">B77&#x2013;B78</xref> and <xref base="F33209270" href="IFRS15_B79.dita#IFRS15_B79" id="IFRS15_X0310">B79&#x2013;B82</xref> provide guidance on accounting for repurchase agreements, consignment arrangements and bill-and-hold arrangements, respectively.</p>       </li><li><li_value>(d)</li_value>         <p base="F31712660" id="IFRS15_P0194">The customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset&#x2014;the transfer of the significant risks and rewards of ownership of an asset to the customer may indicate that the customer has obtained the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the asset. However, when evaluating the risks and rewards of ownership of a promised asset, an entity shall exclude any risks that give rise to a separate performance obligation in addition to the performance obligation to transfer the asset.
