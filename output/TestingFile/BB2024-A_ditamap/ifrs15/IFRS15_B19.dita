For instance, when using a cost-based input method, an adjustment to the measure of progress may be required in the following circumstances:</p><ol outputclass="static" base="F31716881" type="lower-alpha" id="IFRS15_L0064"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>         <p base="F31716882" id="IFRS15_P0583">When a cost incurred does not contribute to an entity&#x2019;s progress in satisfying the&#xa0;performance obligation. For example, an entity would not recognise&#xa0;revenue&#xa0;on the basis of costs incurred that are attributable to significant inefficiencies in the entity&#x2019;s performance that were not reflected in the price of the&#xa0;contract&#xa0;(for example, the costs of unexpected amounts of wasted materials, labour or other resources that were incurred to satisfy the performance obligation).                    </p>       </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>         <p base="F31716894" id="IFRS15_P0584">When a cost incurred is not proportionate to the entity&#x2019;s progress in satisfying the performance obligation.

For example, a faithful depiction of an entity&#x2019;s performance might be to recognise revenue at an amount equal to the cost of a good used to satisfy a performance obligation if the entity expects at contract inception that all of the following conditions would be met:</p>         <ol outputclass="static" base="F31716896" type="lower-roman" id="IFRS15_L0065"><li><li_value>(i)</li_value>             <p base="F31716897" id="IFRS15_P0585">the good is not distinct;</p>           </li><li><li_value>(ii)</li_value>             <p base="F31716899" id="IFRS15_P0586">the customer is expected to obtain control of the good significantly before receiving services related to the good;                            </p>           </li><li><li_value>(iii)</li_value>             <p base="F31716901" id="IFRS15_P0587">the cost of the transferred good is significant relative to the total expected costs to completely satisfy the performance obligation; and</p>           </li><li><li_value>(iv)</li_value>             <p base="F31716903" id="IFRS15_P0588">the entity procures the good from a third party and is not significantly involved in designing and manufacturing the good (but the entity is acting as a principal in accordance with&#xa0;<xref base="F33213673" href="IFRS15_B34.dita#IFRS15_B34" id="IFRS15_X0634">paragraphs B34&#x2013;B38</xref>).</p>           </li></ol>                </li></ol></body></paragraph>
