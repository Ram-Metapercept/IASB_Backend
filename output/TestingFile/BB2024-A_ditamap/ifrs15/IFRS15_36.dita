The assessment of whether an asset has an alternative use to the entity is made at contract inception. After contract inception, an entity shall not update the assessment of the alternative use of an asset unless the parties to the contract approve a contract modification that substantively changes the performance obligation. <xref id="IFRS15_X0297" base="F33204629" href="IFRS15_B6.dita#IFRS15_B6">Paragraphs B6–B8</xref> provide guidance for assessing whether an asset has an alternative use to an entity.</p></body></paragraph>
