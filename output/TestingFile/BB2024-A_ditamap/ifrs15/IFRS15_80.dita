For example, an entity may use a residual approach to estimate the aggregate stand-alone selling price for those promised goods or services with highly variable or uncertain stand-alone selling prices and then use another method to estimate the stand-alone selling prices of the individual goods or services relative to that estimated aggregate stand-alone selling price determined by the residual approach. When an entity uses a combination of methods to estimate the stand-alone selling price of each promised good or service in the contract, the entity shall evaluate whether allocating the transaction price at those estimated stand-alone selling prices would be consistent with the allocation objective in <xref id="IFRS15_X0437" base="F33210149" href="IFRS15_73.dita#IFRS15_73">paragraph 73</xref> and the requirements for estimating stand-alone selling prices in <xref id="IFRS15_X0438" base="F33210150" href="IFRS15_78.dita#IFRS15_78">paragraph 78</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
