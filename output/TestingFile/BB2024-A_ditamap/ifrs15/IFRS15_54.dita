In addition, an entity shall consider all the information (historical, current and forecast) that is reasonably available to the entity and shall identify a reasonable number of possible consideration amounts. The information that an entity uses to estimate the amount of variable consideration would typically be similar to the information that the entity&#x2019;s management uses during the bid-and-proposal process and in establishing prices for promised goods or services. </p></body></paragraph>
