An amount that would compensate an entity for performance completed to date would be an amount that approximates the selling price of the goods or services transferred to date (for example, recovery of the costs incurred by an entity in satisfying the performance obligation plus a reasonable profit margin) rather than compensation for only the entity&#x2019;s potential loss of profit if the contract were to be terminated. Compensation for a reasonable profit margin need not equal the profit margin expected if the contract was fulfilled as promised, but an entity should be entitled to compensation for either of the following amounts:</p><ol outputclass="static" id="IFRS15_L0061" base="F31716847" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P0560" base="F31716848">a proportion of the expected profit margin in the contract that reasonably reflects the extent of the entity&#x2019;s performance under the contract before termination by the customer (or another party); or</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS15_P0561" base="F31716850">a reasonable return on the entity&#x2019;s cost of capital for similar contracts (or the entity&#x2019;s typical operating margin for similar contracts) if the contract-specific margin is higher than the return the entity usually generates from similar contracts.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
