Consideration payable to a customer also includes credit or other items (for example, a coupon or voucher) that can be applied against amounts owed to the entity (or to other parties that purchase the entity’s goods or services from the customer). An entity shall account for consideration payable to a customer as a reduction of the transaction price and, therefore, of revenue unless the payment to the customer is in exchange for a distinct good or service (as described in <xref id="IFRS15_X0409" base="F33210025" href="IFRS15_26.dita#IFRS15_26">paragraphs 26–30</xref>) that the customer transfers to the entity. If the consideration payable to a customer includes a variable amount, an entity shall estimate the transaction price (including assessing whether the estimate of variable consideration is constrained) in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X0410" base="F33210026" href="IFRS15_50.dita#IFRS15_50">paragraphs 50–58</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
