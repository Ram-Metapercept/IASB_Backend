These are examples of protective rights. For example, a contract may (i) specify the maximum amount of use of an asset or limit where or when the customer can use the asset, (ii) require a customer to follow particular operating practices, or (iii) require a customer to inform the supplier of changes in how an asset will be used. Protective rights typically define the scope of the customer&#x2019;s right of use but do not, in isolation, prevent the customer from having the right to direct the use of an asset.</p></body></paragraph>
