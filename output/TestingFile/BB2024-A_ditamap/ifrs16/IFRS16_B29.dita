Consequently, unless the conditions in <xref id="IFRS16_X0428" base="F47961274" href="IFRS16_gB24-B31.dita#IFRS16_gB24-B31/IFRS16_gB24-B31_TI">paragraph B24(b)(ii)</xref> exist, an entity shall not consider decisions that are predetermined before the period of use. For example, if a customer is able only to specify the output of an asset before the period of use, the customer does not have the right to direct the use of that asset. The ability to specify the output in a contract before the period of use, without any other decision-making rights relating to the use of the asset, gives a customer the same rights as any customer that purchases goods or services.</p></body></paragraph>
