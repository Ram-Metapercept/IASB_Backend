A customer can obtain economic       benefits from use of an asset directly or indirectly in many ways, such as by using, holding       or sub-leasing the asset. The economic benefits from use of an asset include its primary       output and by-products (including potential cash flows derived from these items), and other       economic benefits from using the asset that could be realised from a commercial transaction       with a third party.</p></body></paragraph>
