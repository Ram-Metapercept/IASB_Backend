The liability for such waste management is adequately covered in <xref base="F399858" href="../ias37/IAS37_TOC.dita" id="IFRIC06_X0018" scope="local">IAS 37</xref>. However, if, in national legislation, new waste from private households is treated in a similar manner to historical waste from private households, the principles of the Interpretation apply by reference to the hierarchy in <xref base="F1468910" href="../ias08/IAS08_10.dita#IAS08_10" id="IFRIC06_X0019">paragraphs 10–12 of IAS 8</xref>. The <xref base="F1468973" href="../ias08/IAS08_TOC.dita" id="IFRIC06_X0020">IAS 8</xref> hierarchy is also relevant for other regulations that impose obligations in a way that is similar to the cost attribution model specified in the EU Directive.</p></body></paragraph>
