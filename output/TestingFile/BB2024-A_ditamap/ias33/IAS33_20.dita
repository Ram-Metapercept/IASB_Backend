The weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period is the number of ordinary shares outstanding at the beginning of the period, adjusted by the number of ordinary shares bought back  or issued during the period multiplied by a time&#x2011;weighting factor. The&#xa0;time&#x2011;weighting factor is the number of days that the shares are outstanding as a proportion of the total number of days in the period; a reasonable approximation of the weighted average is adequate in many circumstances.</p></body></paragraph>
