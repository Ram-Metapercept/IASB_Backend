Therefore, the number of ordinary shares outstanding is increased without an increase in resources. The&#xa0;number of ordinary shares outstanding before the event is adjusted for the proportionate change in the number of ordinary shares outstanding as if the event had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented. For&#xa0;example, on a two&#x2011;for&#x2011;one bonus issue, the number of ordinary shares outstanding before the issue is multiplied by three to obtain the new total number of ordinary shares, or by two to obtain the number of additional ordinary shares.</p></body></paragraph>
