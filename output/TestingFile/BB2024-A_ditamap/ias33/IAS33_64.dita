If these changes occur after the reporting period but before the financial statements are authorised for issue,  the per share calculations for those and any prior period financial statements presented shall be based on the new number of shares. The fact that per share calculations reflect such changes in the number of shares shall be disclosed. In addition, basic and diluted earnings per share of all periods presented shall be adjusted for the effects of errors  and adjustments resulting from changes in accounting policies accounted for retrospectively .</p></body></paragraph>
