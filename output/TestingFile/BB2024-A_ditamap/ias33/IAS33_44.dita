The sequence in which potential ordinary shares are considered may affect whether they are dilutive. Therefore, to maximise the&#xa0;dilution&#xa0;of basic earnings per share, each issue or series of potential ordinary shares is considered in sequence from the most dilutive to the least dilutive, ie dilutive potential ordinary shares with the lowest &#x2018;earnings per incremental share&#x2019; are included in the diluted earnings per share calculation before those with a higher earnings per incremental share.&#xa0;Options and warrants&#xa0;are generally included first because they do not affect the numerator of the calculation.</p></body></paragraph>
