This is because the potential ordinary shares are usually issued for fair value, resulting in a proportionate change in the resources available to the entity. In a rights issue, however, the exercise price is often less than the fair value of the shares. Therefore, as noted in <xref base="A33-142" href="IAS33_27.dita#IAS33_27" id="IAS33_X0217">paragraph 27(b)</xref>, such a rights issue includes a bonus element. If a rights issue is offered to all existing shareholders, the number of ordinary shares to be used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share for all periods before the rights issue is the number of ordinary shares outstanding before the issue, multiplied by the following factor: </p><table base="F15651560" frame="none" id="IAS33_TAB0001" orient="port"><tgroup cols="1"><colspec align="left" colname="C1" colnum="1" colsep="0" colwidth="100*" rowsep="0"/><tbody><row keep_together="1"><entry align="center" colname="C1" rowsep="1" valign="bottom"> <p id="IAS33_P0205" typeface="sansserif">Fair value per share immediately before the exercise of rights</p></entry></row><row><entry align="center" colname="C1" valign="top"> <p id="IAS33_P0206" typeface="sansserif">Theoretical ex-rights fair value per share</p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p base="F15651561" id="IAS33_P0207">The theoretical ex‑rights fair value per share is calculated by adding the aggregate fair value of the shares immediately before the exercise of the rights to the proceeds from the exercise of the rights, and dividing by the number of shares outstanding after the exercise of the rights. Where the rights are to be publicly traded separately from the shares before the exercise date, fair value is measured at the close of the last day on which the shares are traded together with the rights.</p></body></paragraph>
