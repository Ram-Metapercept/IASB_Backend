The capitalisation rate shall be the weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to all borrowings of the entity that are outstanding during the period.                  However, an entity shall exclude from this calculation borrowing costs applicable to borrowings made specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset until substantially all the activities necessary to prepare that asset for its intended use or sale are complete.                  The amount of borrowing costs that an entity capitalises during a period shall not exceed the amount of borrowing costs it incurred during that period.</p>            </variant></body></paragraph>
