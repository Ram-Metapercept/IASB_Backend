Examples include changes in estimate in the final interim period relating to inventory write‑downs, restructurings, or impairment losses that were reported in an earlier interim period of the financial year. The disclosure required by the preceding paragraph is consistent with the <xref base="F16454003" href="../ias08/IAS08_TOC.dita#IAS08_TOC0001" id="IAS34_X0195">IAS 8</xref> requirement and is intended to be narrow in scope—relating only to the change in estimate. An entity is not required to include additional interim period financial information in its annual financial statements. </p></body></paragraph>
