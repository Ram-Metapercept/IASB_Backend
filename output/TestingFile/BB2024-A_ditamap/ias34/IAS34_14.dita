The parent’s separate financial statements are not consistent or comparable with the consolidated statements in the most recent annual financial report. If an entity’s annual financial report included the parent’s separate financial statements in addition to consolidated financial statements, this Standard neither requires nor prohibits the inclusion of the parent’s separate statements in the entity’s interim financial report.</p></body></paragraph>
