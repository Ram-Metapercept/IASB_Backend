However, by providing that the frequency of an entity&#x2019;s reporting shall not affect the measurement of its annual results,&#xa0;<xref base="A34-72" href="IAS34_28.dita#IAS34_28" id="IAS34_X0204">paragraph 28</xref>&#xa0;acknowledges that an interim period is a part of a larger financial year. Year&#x2011;to&#x2011;date measurements may involve changes in estimates of amounts reported in prior interim periods of the current financial year. But the principles for recognising assets, liabilities, income, and expenses for interim periods are the same as in annual financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
