In some cases the basis for the presentation of financial instruments in the statement of financial position differs from the basis for the measurement of financial instruments, for example, if an IFRS does not require or permit financial instruments to be presented on a net basis . In such cases an entity may need to allocate the portfolio&#x2011;level adjustments (see paragraphs 53&#x2013;56) to the individual assets or liabilities that make up the group of financial assets and financial liabilities managed on the basis of the entity&#x2019;s net risk exposure. An entity shall perform such allocations on a reasonable and consistent basis using a methodology appropriate in the circumstances.</p></body></paragraph>
