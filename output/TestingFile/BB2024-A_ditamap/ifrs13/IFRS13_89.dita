In developing unobservable inputs, an entity may begin with its own data, but it shall adjust those data if reasonably available information indicates that other market participants  would use different data or there is something particular to the entity that is not available to other market participants (eg an entity‑specific synergy).  An entity need not undertake exhaustive efforts to obtain information about market participant assumptions.  However, an entity shall take into account all information about market participant assumptions that is reasonably available. Unobservable inputs developed in the manner described above are considered market participant assumptions and meet the objective of a fair value measurement.</p></body></paragraph>
