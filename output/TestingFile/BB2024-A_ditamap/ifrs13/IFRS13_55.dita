For example, an entity that uses a 12&#x2011;month futures contract against the cash flows associated with 12 months&#x2019; worth of interest rate risk exposure on a five&#x2011;year financial instrument within a group made up of only those financial assets and financial liabilities measures the fair value of the exposure to 12&#x2011;month interest rate risk on a net basis and the remaining interest rate risk exposure (ie years 2&#x2013;5) on a gross basis.</p></body></paragraph>
