For some assets and liabilities, observable market transactions or market information might be available. For other assets and liabilities, observable market transactions and market information might not be available. However, the objective of a fair value measurement in both cases is the same&#x2014;to estimate the price at which an <i>orderly transaction</i> to sell the asset  or to transfer the liability  would take place between <i>market participants</i> at the measurement date under current market conditions (ie an <i>exit price</i> at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability). </p></body></paragraph>
