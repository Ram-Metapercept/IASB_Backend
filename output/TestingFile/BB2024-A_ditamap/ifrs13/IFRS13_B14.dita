For example, a discount rate that reflects the uncertainty in expectations about future defaults  is appropriate if using contractual cash flows of a loan (ie a discount rate adjustment technique). That same rate should not be used if using expected (ie probability‑weighted) cash flows (ie an expected present value technique) because the expected cash flows already reflect assumptions about the uncertainty in future defaults; instead, a discount rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent in the expected cash flows should be used.</p></li><li><li_value>(d)</li_value> <p id="IFRS13_P0340" base="F16132628">Assumptions about cash flows and discount rates should be internally consistent. For example, nominal cash flows, which include the effect of inflation, should be discounted at a rate that includes the effect of inflation. The nominal risk‑free interest rate includes the effect of inflation. Real cash flows, which exclude the effect of inflation, should be discounted at a rate that excludes the effect of inflation. Similarly, after‑tax cash flows should be discounted using an after‑tax discount rate. Pre‑tax cash flows should be discounted at a rate consistent with those cash flows.</p></li><li><li_value>(e)</li_value> <p id="IFRS13_P0341" base="F16132630">Discount rates should be consistent with the underlying economic factors of the currency in which the cash flows are denominated.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
