Those risk&#x2011;adjusted expected cash flows represent a certainty&#x2011;equivalent cash flow, which is discounted at a risk&#x2011;free interest rate. A certainty&#x2011;equivalent cash flow refers to an expected cash flow (as defined), adjusted for risk so that a market participant  is indifferent to trading a certain cash flow for an expected cash flow. For example, if a market participant was willing to trade an expected cash flow of CU1,200 for a certain cash flow of CU1,000, the CU1,000 is the certainty equivalent of the CU1,200 (ie&#xa0;the CU200 would represent the cash risk premium). In that case the market participant would be indifferent as to the asset held.</p></body></paragraph>
