For example, if a market participant would take into account the effect of a restriction on the sale of an asset  when estimating the price for the asset , an entity would adjust the quoted price to reflect the effect of that restriction. If that quoted price is a <i>Level 2 input</i> and the adjustment  is an unobservable input that is significant to the entire measurement, the measurement would be categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.</p></body></paragraph>
