An entity shall ensure that the price of the asset does not reflect the effect of a restriction preventing the sale of that asset . Some factors that may indicate that the quoted price of the asset should be adjusted include the following: </p><ol outputclass="static" id="IFRS13_L0015" base="F16131822" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS13_P0100" base="F16131873">The quoted price for the asset relates to a similar (but not identical) liability or equity instrument held by another party as an asset.  For example, the liability or equity instrument may have a particular characteristic (eg the credit quality of the issuer) that is different from that reflected in the fair value of the similar liability or equity instrument held as an asset.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS13_P0101" base="F16131875">The unit of account for the asset is not the same as for the liability or equity instrument. For example, for liabilities, in some cases the price for an asset reflects a combined price for a package comprising both the amounts due from the issuer and a third&#x2011;party credit enhancement.  If the unit of account for the liability is not for the combined package, the objective is to measure the fair value of the issuer&#x2019;s liability, not the fair value of the combined package. Thus, in such cases, the entity would adjust the observed price for the asset to exclude the effect of the third&#x2011;party credit enhancement. </p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
