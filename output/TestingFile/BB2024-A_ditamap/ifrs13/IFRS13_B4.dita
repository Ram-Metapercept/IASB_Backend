For example, the transaction price might not represent the fair value of an asset or a liability at initial recognition if any of the following conditions exist:</p><ol outputclass="static" id="IFRS13_L0037" base="F16132538" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS13_P0303" base="F16132545">The transaction is between related parties, although the price in a related party transaction may be used as an input into a fair value measurement if the entity has evidence that the transaction was entered into at market terms.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS13_P0304" base="F16132547">The transaction takes place under duress or the seller is forced to accept the price in the transaction.

For example, that might be the case if the asset or liability measured at fair value is only one of the elements in the transaction (eg in a business combination), the transaction includes unstated rights and privileges that are measured separately in accordance with another IFRS, or the transaction price includes transaction costs.</p></li><li><li_value>(d)</li_value> <p id="IFRS13_P0306" base="F16132551">The market in which the transaction takes place is different from the principal market  (or most advantageous market ). For example, those markets might be different if the entity is a dealer that enters into transactions with customers in the retail market, but the principal (or most advantageous) market for the exit transaction is with other dealers in the dealer market. </p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
