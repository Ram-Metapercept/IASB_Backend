However, the fair value measurement objective  remains the same, ie an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant  that holds the asset or owes the liability. Therefore, unobservable inputs shall reflect the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk.</p></body></paragraph>
