Comparability is established by considering the nature of the cash flows (eg whether the cash flows are contractual or non‑contractual and are likely to respond similarly to changes in economic conditions), as well as other factors (eg credit standing, collateral, duration, restrictive covenants and liquidity). Alternatively, if a single comparable asset or liability does not fairly reflect the risk inherent in the cash flows of the asset or liability being measured, it may be possible to derive a discount rate using data for several comparable assets or liabilities in conjunction with the risk‑free yield curve (ie using a ‘build‑up’ approach).</p></body></paragraph>
