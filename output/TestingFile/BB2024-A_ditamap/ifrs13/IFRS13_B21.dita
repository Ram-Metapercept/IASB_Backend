Using the contractual payment to be received for Asset A (CU800) and the one‑year market rate derived from Asset B (10.8 per cent), the fair value of Asset A is CU722 (CU800/1.108). Alternatively, in the absence of available market information for Asset B, the one‑year market rate could be derived from Asset C using the build‑up approach. In that case the two‑year market rate indicated by Asset C (11.2 per cent) would be adjusted to a one‑year market rate using the term structure of the risk‑free yield curve. Additional information and analysis might be required to determine whether the risk premiums for one‑year and two‑year assets are the same. If it is determined that the risk premiums for one‑year and two‑year assets are not the same, the two‑year market rate of return would be further adjusted for that effect.</p></body></paragraph>
