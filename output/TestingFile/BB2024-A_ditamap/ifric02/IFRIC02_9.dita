An unconditional prohibition may be partial, in that it prohibits redemption of members’ shares if redemption would cause the number of members’ shares or amount of paid‑in capital from members’ shares to fall below a specified level. Members’ shares in excess of the prohibition against redemption are liabilities, unless the entity has the unconditional right to refuse redemption as described in <xref id="IFRIC02_X0045" base="F6037739" href="IFRIC02_7.dita#IFRIC02_7">paragraph 7</xref> or the members’ shares have all the features and meet the conditions in <xref id="IFRIC02_X0046" base="F6037740" href="../ias32/IAS32_g16A-16B.dita#IAS32_g16A-16B/IAS32_g16A-16B_TI">paragraphs 16A and 16B</xref> or <xref id="IFRIC02_X0047" base="F6037741" href="../ias32/IAS32_g16C-16D.dita#IAS32_g16C-16D/IAS32_g16C-16D_TI">paragraphs 16C and 16D of IAS 32</xref>. In some cases, the number of shares or the amount of paid‑in capital subject to a redemption prohibition may change from time to time. Such a change in the redemption prohibition leads to a transfer between financial liabilities and equity.</p></body></paragraph>
