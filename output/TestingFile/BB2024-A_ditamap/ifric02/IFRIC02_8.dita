If&#xa0;redemption is unconditionally prohibited by local law, regulation or the entity&#x2019;s governing charter, members&#x2019; shares are equity. However, provisions in local law, regulation or the entity&#x2019;s governing charter that prohibit redemption only if conditions&#x2014;such as liquidity constraints&#x2014;are met (or are not met) do not result in members&#x2019; shares being equity.</p></body></paragraph>
