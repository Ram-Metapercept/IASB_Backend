Those restrictions are limitations on the ability of the entity to pay the amount due on a financial liability, ie&#xa0;they prevent payment of the liability only if specified conditions are met. In contrast, this example describes an unconditional prohibition on redemptions beyond a specified amount, regardless of the entity&#x2019;s ability to redeem members&#x2019; shares (eg given its cash resources, profits or distributable reserves). In effect, the prohibition against redemption prevents the entity from incurring any financial liability to redeem more than a specified amount of paid&#x2011;in capital. Therefore, the portion of shares subject to the redemption prohibition is not a financial liability. While each member&#x2019;s shares may be redeemable individually, a portion of the total shares outstanding is not redeemable in any circumstances other than liquidation of the entity.</p></body></paragraph>
