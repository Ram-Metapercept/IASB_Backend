The&#xa0;redemption prohibition is similar to the restrictions described in <xref id="IFRIC02_X0091" base="F255399" href="../ias32/IAS32_19.dita#IAS32_19">paragraphs&#xa0;19</xref> <xref id="IFRIC02_X0092" base="SL209862" href="../ias32/IAS32_AG25.dita#IAS32_AG25">and AG25 of IAS&#xa0;32</xref>. The restriction is a conditional limitation on the ability of the entity to pay the amount due on a financial liability, ie they prevent payment of the liability only if specified conditions are met. More specifically, the entity could be required to redeem the entire amount of members&#x2019; shares (CU125,000) if it repaid all of its other liabilities (CU75,000). Consequently, the prohibition against redemption does not prevent the entity from incurring a financial liability to redeem more than a specified number of members&#x2019; shares or amount of paid&#x2011;in capital. It&#xa0;allows the entity only to defer redemption until a condition is met, ie the repayment of other liabilities. Members&#x2019; shares in this example are not subject to an unconditional prohibition against redemption and are therefore classified as financial liabilities.</p></body></paragraph>
