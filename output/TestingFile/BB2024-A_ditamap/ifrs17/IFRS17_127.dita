Concentrations of financial risk might arise, for example, from interest-rate guarantees that come into effect at the same level for a large number of contracts. Concentrations of financial risk might also arise from concentrations of non-financial risk; for example, if an entity provides product liability protection to pharmaceutical companies and also holds investments in those companies.</p></bodydiv></body></paragraph>
