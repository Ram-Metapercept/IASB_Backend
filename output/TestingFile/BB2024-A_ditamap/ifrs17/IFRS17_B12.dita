This definition does not limit the payment by the entity to an amount equal to the financial effect of the adverse event. For example, the definition includes &#x2018;new for old&#x2019; insurance coverage that pays the policyholder an amount that permits the replacement of a used and damaged asset with a new one. Similarly, the definition does not limit the payment under a life insurance contract to the financial loss suffered by the deceased&#x2019;s dependants, nor does it exclude contracts that specify the payment of predetermined amounts to quantify the loss caused by death or an accident.</p></bodydiv></body></paragraph>
