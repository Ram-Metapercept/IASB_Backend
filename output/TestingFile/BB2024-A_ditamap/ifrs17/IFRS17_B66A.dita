Cash flows are related to the group of insurance contracts if those cash flows would have been included in the fulfilment cash flows at the date of initial recognition of the group had they been paid or received after that date. To apply <xref href="IFRS17_38.dita">paragraph 38(c)(ii)</xref> an entity shall derecognise such an asset or liability to the extent that the asset or liability would not be recognised separately from the group of insurance contracts if the cash flow or the application of the IFRS Standard occurred at the date of initial recognition of the group of insurance contracts.</p></body></paragraph>
