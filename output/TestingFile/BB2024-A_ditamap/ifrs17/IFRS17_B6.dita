In such cases, the entity provides goods or services to the policyholder to settle the entity&#x2019;s obligation to compensate the policyholder for insured events. An example is when the entity replaces a stolen article instead of reimbursing the policyholder for the amount of its loss. Another example is when an entity uses its own hospitals and medical staff to provide medical services covered by the insurance contract. Such contracts are insurance contracts, even though the claims are settled in kind. Fixed-fee service contracts that meet the conditions specified in <xref base="F59236089" href="IFRS17_8.dita#IFRS17_8" id="IFRS17_X0540">paragraph&#xa0;8</xref> are also insurance contracts, but applying paragraph 8, an entity may choose to account for them applying either <xref base="F59236090" href="IFRS17_TOC.dita#IFRS17_TOC0001" id="IFRS17_X0541">IFRS&#xa0;17</xref> or <xref base="F59236091" href="../ifrs14/IFRS15_TOC.dita#IFRS15_TOC0001/IFRS15_TOC0001_V2" id="IFRS17_X0542">IFRS&#xa0;15 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Revenue from Contracts with Customers</ph></ph></xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
