Applying <xref id="IFRS17_X0245" base="F60991554" href="IFRS17_16.dita#IFRS17_16">paragraph&#xa0;16(a)</xref>, an entity shall group such contracts separately from contracts that are not onerous. To the extent that <xref id="IFRS17_X0246" base="F60991555" href="IFRS17_17.dita#IFRS17_17">paragraph&#xa0;17</xref> applies, an entity may identify the group of onerous contracts by measuring a set of contracts rather than individual contracts.              An entity shall recognise a loss in profit or loss for the net outflow for the group of onerous contracts, resulting in the carrying amount of the liability for the group being equal to the fulfilment cash flows and the contractual service margin of the group being zero.</p>            </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
