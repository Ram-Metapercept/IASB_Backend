As noted in <xref id="IFRS17_X0554" base="F59236129" href="IFRS17_B21.dita#IFRS17_B21">paragraph B21(b)</xref>, the waiver on death of cancellation or surrender charges is not included in this assessment if that waiver does not compensate the policyholder for a pre-existing risk. Similarly, an annuity contract that pays out regular sums for the rest of a policyholder’s life is an insurance contract, unless the aggregate life-contingent payments are insignificant.</p></body></paragraph>
