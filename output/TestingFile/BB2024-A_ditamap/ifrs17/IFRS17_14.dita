A portfolio         comprises contracts subject to similar risks and managed together. Contracts within a         product line would be expected to have similar risks and hence would be expected to be in         the same portfolio if they are managed together. Contracts in different product lines (for         example single premium fixed annuities compared with regular term life assurance) would not         be expected to have similar risks and hence would be expected to be in different         portfolios.</p></bodydiv></body></paragraph>
