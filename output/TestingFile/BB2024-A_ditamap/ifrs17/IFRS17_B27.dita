For example, some financial&#xa0;reinsurance contracts&#xa0;or some group contracts return all significant insurance risk to the policyholders; such contracts are normally financial instruments or service contracts (see&#xa0;<xref base="F59236165" href="IFRS17_B28.dita#IFRS17_B28" id="IFRS17_X0564">paragraph&#xa0;B28</xref>).</p>       </li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value>         <p base="F55667154" id="IFRS17_P0624">self-insurance (ie&#xa0;retaining a risk that could have been covered by insurance). In such situations, there is no insurance contract because there is no agreement with another party. Thus, if an entity issues an insurance contract to its parent, subsidiary or fellow subsidiary, there is no insurance contract in the consolidated financial statements because there is no contract with another party.
