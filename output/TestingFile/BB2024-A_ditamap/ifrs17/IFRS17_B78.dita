Such discount rates may not be directly observable in the market. Hence, when observable market rates for an instrument with the same characteristics are not available, or observable market rates for similar instruments are available but do not separately identify the factors that distinguish the instrument from the insurance contracts, an entity shall estimate the appropriate rates. IFRS&#xa0;17 does not require a particular estimation technique for determining discount rates. In applying an estimation technique, an entity shall:</p><ol outputclass="static" id="IFRS17_L0127" base="F55667426" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS17_P0776" base="F55667427">maximise the use of observable inputs (see <xref id="IFRS17_X0638" base="F59236368" href="IFRS17_gB44-B48.dita#IFRS17_gB44-B48/IFRS17_gB44-B48_TI">paragraph&#xa0;B44</xref>) and reflect all reasonable and supportable information on non-market variables available without undue cost or effort, both external and internal (see <xref id="IFRS17_X0639" base="F59236401" href="IFRS17_gB49-B53.dita#IFRS17_gB49-B53/IFRS17_gB49-B53_TI">paragraph&#xa0;B49</xref>).
