Those contracts are insurance contracts if they require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss that the holder incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due to the policyholder applying the original or modified terms of a debt instrument. However, such insurance contracts are excluded from the scope of IFRS 17 unless the issuer has previously asserted explicitly that it regards the contracts as insurance contracts and has used accounting applicable to insurance contracts (see <xref id="IFRS17_X0572" base="F59236170" href="IFRS17_7.dita#IFRS17_7">paragraph 7(e)</xref>). </p></body></paragraph>
