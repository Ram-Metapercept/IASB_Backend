A party is a de facto agent when the investor has, or those that direct the activities of the investor have, the ability to direct that party to act on the investor’s behalf. In these circumstances, the investor shall consider its de facto agent’s decision‑making rights and its indirect exposure, or rights, to variable returns through the de facto agent together with its own when assessing control of an investee.</p></body></paragraph>
