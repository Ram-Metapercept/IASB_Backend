An investor shall also determine whether another entity with decision‑making rights is acting as an agent for the investor. An agent is a party primarily engaged to act on behalf and for the benefit of another party or parties (the principal(s)) and therefore does not control the investee when it exercises its decision‑making authority (see <xref id="IFRS10_X0462" base="F16219590" href="IFRS10_g17-18.dita#IFRS10_g17-18/IFRS10_g17-18_TI">paragraphs 17 and 18</xref>). Thus, sometimes a principal’s power may be held and exercisable by an agent, but on behalf of the principal. A decision maker is not an agent simply because other parties can benefit from the decisions that it makes.</p></body></paragraph>
