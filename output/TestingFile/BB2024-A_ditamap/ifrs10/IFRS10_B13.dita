One investor is responsible for developing and obtaining regulatory approval of the medical product&#x2014;that responsibility includes having the unilateral ability to make all decisions relating to the development of the product and to obtaining regulatory approval. Once the regulator has approved the product, the other investor will manufacture and market it&#x2014;this investor has the unilateral ability to make all decisions about the manufacture and marketing of the product. If all the activities&#x2014;developing and obtaining regulatory approval as well as manufacturing and marketing of the medical product&#x2014;are&#xa0;relevant activities, each investor needs to determine whether it is able to direct the activities that&#xa0;<i>most</i>&#xa0;significantly affect the investee&#x2019;s returns. Accordingly, each investor needs to consider whether developing and obtaining regulatory approval or the manufacturing and marketing of the medical product is the activity that most significantly affects the investee&#x2019;s returns and whether it is able to direct that activity.

The equity tranche is designed to absorb the first losses and to receive any residual return from the investee. One of the equity investors who holds 30&#xa0;per cent of the equity is also the asset manager. The investee uses its proceeds to purchase a portfolio of financial assets, exposing the investee to the credit risk associated with the possible default of principal and interest payments of the assets. The transaction is marketed to the debt investor as an investment with minimal exposure to the credit risk associated with the possible default of the assets in the portfolio because of the nature of these assets and because the equity tranche is designed to absorb the first losses of the investee. The returns of the investee are significantly affected by the management of the investee&#x2019;s asset portfolio, which includes decisions about the selection, acquisition and disposal of the assets within portfolio guidelines and the management upon default of any portfolio assets. All those activities are managed by the asset manager until defaults reach a specified proportion of the portfolio value (ie&#xa0;when the value of the portfolio is such that the equity tranche of the investee has been consumed). From that time, a third-party trustee manages the assets according to the instructions of the debt investor. Managing the investee&#x2019;s asset portfolio is the relevant activity of the investee. The asset manager has the ability to direct the&#xa0;relevant activities until defaulted assets reach the specified proportion of the portfolio value; the debt investor has the ability to direct the relevant activities when the value of defaulted assets surpasses that specified proportion of the portfolio value. The asset manager and the debt investor each need to determine whether they are able to direct the activities that&#xa0;<i>most</i>&#xa0;significantly affect the investee&#x2019;s returns, including considering the purpose and design of the investee as well as each party&#x2019;s exposure to variability of returns.</p>             </entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></body></paragraph>
