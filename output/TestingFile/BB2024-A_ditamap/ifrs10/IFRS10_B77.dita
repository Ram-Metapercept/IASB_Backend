Parties other than those with the specified liability do not have rights or obligations related to the specified assets or to residual cash flows from those assets. In substance, none of the returns from the specified assets can be used by the remaining investee and none of the liabilities of the deemed separate entity are payable from the assets of the remaining investee. Thus, in substance, all the assets, liabilities and equity of that deemed separate entity are ring&#x2011;fenced from the overall investee. Such a deemed separate entity is often called a &#x2018;silo&#x2019;.</p>       </li></ol></body></paragraph>
