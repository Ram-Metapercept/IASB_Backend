If an investor, having considered those factors, is unclear whether it has power, it shall consider additional facts and circumstances, such as whether other shareholders are passive in nature as demonstrated by voting patterns at previous shareholders&#x2019; meetings. This includes the assessment of the factors set out in&#xa0;<xref base="F16219266" href="IFRS10_B18.dita#IFRS10_B18" id="IFRS10_X0424">paragraph B18</xref>&#xa0;and the indicators in&#xa0;<xref base="F16219267" href="IFRS10_B19.dita#IFRS10_B19" id="IFRS10_X0425">paragraphs B19 and B20</xref>. The fewer voting rights the investor holds, and the fewer parties that would need to act together to outvote the investor, the more reliance would be placed on the additional facts and circumstances to assess whether the investor&#x2019;s rights are sufficient to give it power. When the facts and circumstances in paragraphs B18&#x2013;B20 are considered together with the investor&#x2019;s rights, greater weight shall be given to the evidence of power in paragraph B18 than to the indicators of power in paragraphs B19 and B20.</p><table base="F16127050" frame="all" orient="port" id="IFRS10_TAB0005"><tgroup cols="1"><colspec align="left" colnum="1" colsep="0" rowsep="0" colname="C1" colwidth="100*"/><thead><row><entry align="left" colname="C1" rowsep="1">               Application examples             </entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname="C1">               <p typeface="sansserif" base="F23921958" id="IFRS10_P0361"><b>Example 7</b></p>                              <p base="F16127053" id="IFRS10_P0363">An investor holds 45&#xa0;per cent of the voting rights of an investee. Eleven other shareholders each hold 5&#xa0;per cent of the voting rights of the investee. None of the shareholders has contractual arrangements to consult any of the others or make collective decisions. In this case, the absolute size of the investor&#x2019;s holding and the relative size of the other shareholdings alone are not conclusive in determining whether the investor has rights sufficient to give it&#xa0;power&#xa0;over the investee.

The remaining voting rights are held by numerous other shareholders, none individually holding more than 1&#xa0;per cent of the voting rights. None of the shareholders has arrangements to consult any of the others or make collective decisions. Decisions about the relevant activities of the investee require the approval of a majority of votes cast at relevant shareholders&#x2019; meetings&#x2014;75&#xa0;per cent of the voting rights of the investee have been cast at recent relevant shareholders&#x2019; meetings. In this case, the active participation of the other shareholders at recent shareholders&#x2019; meetings indicates that the investor would not have the practical ability to direct the relevant activities unilaterally, regardless of whether the investor has directed the relevant activities because a sufficient number of other shareholders voted in the same way as the investor.</p>             </entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></body></paragraph>
