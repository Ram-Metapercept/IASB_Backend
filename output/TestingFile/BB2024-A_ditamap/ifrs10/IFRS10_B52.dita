When these contractual arrangements involve activities that are closely related to the investee, then these activities are, in substance, an integral part of the investee&#x2019;s overall activities, even though they may occur outside the legal boundaries of the investee. Therefore, explicit or implicit decision&#x2011;making rights embedded in contractual arrangements that are closely related to the investee need to be considered as relevant activities when determining power over the investee.</p></body></paragraph>
