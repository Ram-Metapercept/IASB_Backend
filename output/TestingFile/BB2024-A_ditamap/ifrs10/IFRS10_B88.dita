Income and expenses of the subsidiary are based on the amounts of the assets and liabilities recognised in the consolidated financial statements at the acquisition date.  For example, depreciation expense recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income after the acquisition date is based on the fair values  of the related depreciable assets recognised in the consolidated financial statements at the acquisition date.</p></body></paragraph>
