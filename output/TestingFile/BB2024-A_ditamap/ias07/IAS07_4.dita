Cash flow information is useful in assessing the ability of the entity to generate&#xa0;cash&#xa0;and&#xa0;cash equivalents&#xa0;and enables users to develop models to assess and compare the present value of the future cash flows of different entities. It also enhances the comparability                     of the reporting of operating performance by different entities because it eliminates the effects of using different accounting treatments for the same transactions and events.</p></body></paragraph>
