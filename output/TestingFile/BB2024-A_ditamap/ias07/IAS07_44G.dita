These arrangements provide the entity with extended payment terms, or the entity&#x2019;s       suppliers with early payment terms, compared to the related invoice payment due date. Supplier       finance arrangements are often referred to as supply chain finance, payables finance or       reverse factoring arrangements. Arrangements that are solely credit enhancements for the       entity (for example, financial guarantees including letters of credit used as guarantees) or       instruments used by the entity to settle directly with a supplier the amounts owed (for       example, credit cards) are not supplier finance arrangements.</p></body></paragraph>
