Similarly, items such as deferred revenue and most warranty obligations are not&#xa0;financial liabilities&#xa0;because the outflow of economic benefits associated with them is the delivery of goods and services rather than a contractual obligation to pay cash or another financial asset.</p></body></paragraph>
