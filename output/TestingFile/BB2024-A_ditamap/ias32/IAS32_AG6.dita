For example, an&#xa0;entity may issue a&#xa0;financial instrument&#xa0;requiring it to make annual payments in perpetuity equal to a stated interest rate of 8 per cent applied to a stated par or principal amount of CU1,000.<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS32_FN0031" type="fn"/>&#xa0;Assuming 8&#xa0;per cent to be the market rate of interest for the instrument when issued, the issuer assumes a contractual obligation to make a stream of future interest payments having a&#xa0;fair value&#xa0;(present value) of CU1,000 on initial recognition. The holder and issuer of the instrument have a&#xa0;financial asset&#xa0;and a&#xa0;financial liability, respectively.</p></body></paragraph>
