Similarly, some contracts to buy or sell a non‑financial item in exchange for the entity’s own equity instruments are within the scope of this Standard because they can be settled either by delivery of the non‑financial item or net in cash or another financial instrument (see <xref id="IAS32_X0363" base="SL181617" href="IAS32_8.dita#IAS32_8">paragraphs 8–10</xref>). Such contracts are financial assets or financial liabilities and not equity instruments.</p></body></paragraph>
