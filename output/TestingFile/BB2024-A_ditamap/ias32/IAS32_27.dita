Similarly, some contracts to buy or sell a non&#x2011;financial item in exchange for the entity&#x2019;s own equity instruments are within the scope of this Standard because they can be settled either by delivery of the non&#x2011;financial item or net in cash or another financial instrument (see <xref id="IAS32_X0363" base="SL181617" href="IAS32_8.dita#IAS32_8">paragraphs 8&#x2013;10</xref>). Such&#xa0;contracts are financial assets or financial liabilities and not equity instruments.</p></body></paragraph>
