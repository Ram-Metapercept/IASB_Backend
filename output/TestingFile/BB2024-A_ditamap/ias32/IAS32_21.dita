An entity may have a contractual right or obligation to receive or deliver a number of its own shares or other equity instruments that varies so that the&#xa0;fair value&#xa0;of the entity&#x2019;s own equity instruments to be received or delivered equals the amount of the contractual right or obligation. Such a contractual right or obligation may be for a fixed amount or an amount that fluctuates in part or in full in response to changes in a variable other than the market price of the entity&#x2019;s own equity instruments (eg an interest rate, a commodity price or a&#xa0;financial instrument&#xa0;price). Two examples are (a) a contract to deliver as many of the entity&#x2019;s own equity instruments as are equal in value to CU100,<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS32_FN0017" type="fn"/>&#xa0;and (b)&#xa0;a&#xa0;contract to deliver as many of the entity&#x2019;s own equity instruments as are equal in value to the value of 100&#xa0;ounces of gold. Such a contract is a&#xa0;financial liability&#xa0;of the entity even though the entity must or can settle it by delivering its own equity instruments. It&#xa0;is not an equity instrument because the entity uses a variable number of its own equity instruments as a means to settle the contract. Accordingly, the contract does not evidence a residual interest in the entity&#x2019;s assets after deducting all of its liabilities.</p></body></paragraph>
