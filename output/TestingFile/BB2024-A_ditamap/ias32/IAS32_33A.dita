Similarly, some entities issue groups of insurance contracts with direct participation features and those entities hold the underlying items. Some such funds or underlying items include the entity&#x2019;s treasury shares. Despite <xref base="F58803738" href="IAS32_g33-34.dita#IAS32_g33-34/IAS32_g33-34_TI" id="IAS32_X0393">paragraph&#xa0;33</xref>, an entity may elect not to deduct from equity a treasury share that is included in such a fund or is an underlying item when, and only when, an entity reacquires its own equity instrument for such purposes. Instead, the entity may elect to continue to account for that treasury share as equity and to account for the reacquired instrument as if the instrument were a financial asset and measure it at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with <xref base="F70390802" href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_TOC.dita#IFRS09_TOC0001/IFRS09_TOC0001_V2" id="IAS32_X0394">IFRS&#xa0;9</xref>. That election is irrevocable and made on an instrument-by-instrument basis. For the purposes of this election, insurance contracts include investment contracts with discretionary participation features.
