Consequently, it cannot be assumed that the right of set‑off is automatically available outside of the normal course of business. For example, the bankruptcy or insolvency laws of a jurisdiction may prohibit, or restrict, the right of set‑off in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency in some circumstances.</p></body></paragraph>
