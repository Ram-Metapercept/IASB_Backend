Substance and legal form are commonly consistent, but not always. Some financial instruments take the legal form of equity but are liabilities in substance and others may combine features associated with equity instruments and features associated with financial liabilities.  For example: </p><ol outputclass="static" id="IAS32_L0037" base="SL147265" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IAS32_P0249" base="SL147267">a preference share that provides for mandatory redemption by the issuer for a fixed or determinable amount at a fixed or determinable future date, or gives the holder the right to require the issuer to redeem the instrument at or after a particular date for a fixed or determinable amount, is a financial liability.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IAS32_P0250" base="SL147269">a financial instrument that gives the holder the right to put it back to the issuer for cash or another financial asset (a ‘puttable instrument’) is a financial liability, except for those instruments classified as equity instruments in accordance with <xref id="IAS32_X0294" base="F6036951" href="IAS32_g16A-16B.dita#IAS32_g16A-16B/IAS32_g16A-16B_TI">paragraphs 16A and 16B</xref> or <xref id="IAS32_X0295" base="F6037016" href="IAS32_g16C-16D.dita#IAS32_g16C-16D/IAS32_g16C-16D_TI">paragraphs 16C and 16D</xref>. The financial instrument is a financial liability even when the amount of cash or other financial assets is determined on the basis of an index or other item that has the potential to increase or decrease. The existence of an option for the holder to put the instrument back to the issuer for cash or another financial asset means that the puttable instrument meets the definition of a financial liability, except for those instruments classified as equity instruments in accordance with <xref id="IAS32_X0296" base="F6037020" href="IAS32_g16A-16B.dita#IAS32_g16A-16B/IAS32_g16A-16B_TI">paragraphs 16A and 16B</xref> or <xref id="IAS32_X0297" base="F6037021" href="IAS32_g16C-16D.dita#IAS32_g16C-16D/IAS32_g16C-16D_TI">paragraphs 16C and 16D</xref>. For example, open‑ended mutual funds, unit trusts, partnerships and some co‑operative entities may provide their unitholders or members with a right to redeem their interests in the issuer at any time for cash, which results in the unitholders’ or members’ interests being classified as financial liabilities, except for those instruments classified as equity instruments in accordance with <xref id="IAS32_X0298" base="F6037018" href="IAS32_g16A-16B.dita#IAS32_g16A-16B/IAS32_g16A-16B_TI">paragraphs 16A and 16B</xref> or <xref id="IAS32_X0299" base="F6037019" href="IAS32_g16C-16D.dita#IAS32_g16C-16D/IAS32_g16C-16D_TI">paragraphs 16C and 16D</xref>. However, classification as a financial liability does not preclude the use of descriptors such as ‘net asset value attributable to unitholders’ and ‘change in net asset value attributable to unitholders’ in the financial statements of an entity that has no contributed equity (such as some mutual funds and unit trusts, see <xref id="IAS32_X0300" base="F16453121" href="IAS32_gIE32-IE32.dita#IAS32_gIE32-IE32">Illustrative Example 7</xref>) or the use of additional disclosure to show that total members’ interests comprise items such as reserves that meet the definition of equity and puttable instruments that do not (see <xref id="IAS32_X0301" base="F16143191" href="IAS32_gIE33-IE33.dita#IAS32_gIE33-IE33">Illustrative Example 8</xref>).</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
