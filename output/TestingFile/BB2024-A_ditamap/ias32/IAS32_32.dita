The&#xa0;carrying amount of the&#xa0;equity instrument&#xa0;represented by the option to convert the instrument into ordinary shares is then determined by deducting the fair value of the&#xa0;financial liability&#xa0;from the fair value of the compound financial instrument as a whole.</p></body></paragraph>
