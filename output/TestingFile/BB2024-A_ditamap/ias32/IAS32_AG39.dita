For example, a floating rate long&#x2011;term debt combined with an interest rate swap that involves receiving floating payments and making fixed payments synthesises a fixed rate long&#x2011;term debt. Each of the individual financial instruments that together constitute a &#x2018;synthetic instrument&#x2019; represents a contractual right or obligation with its own terms and conditions and each may be transferred or settled separately. Each financial instrument is exposed to risks that may differ from the risks to which other financial instruments are exposed.&#xa0;Accordingly, when one financial instrument in a &#x2018;synthetic instrument&#x2019; is an asset and another is a liability, they are not offset and presented in an entity&#x2019;s statement of financial position on a net basis unless they meet the criteria for offsetting in <xref id="IAS32_X0718" base="F19291991" href="IAS32_42.dita#IAS32_42/IAS32_42_V2">paragraph&#xa0;42</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
