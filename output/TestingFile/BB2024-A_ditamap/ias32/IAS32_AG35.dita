The difference, at the date the terms are amended, between the fair value of the consideration the holder receives on conversion of the instrument under the revised terms and the&#xa0;fair value&#xa0;of the consideration the holder would have received under the original terms is recognised as a loss in profit or loss.</p></body></paragraph>
