This is the case even if the contract itself is an equity instrument. One example         is an entity&#x2019;s obligation under a forward contract to purchase its own equity instruments         for cash. The financial liability is recognised initially  at the present value of the redemption amount, and is         reclassified from equity. Subsequently, the financial liability is measured in accordance         with <xref base="F70390754" href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_TOC.dita#IFRS09_TOC0001" id="IAS32_X0342">IFRS&#xa0;9</xref>.  If the contract expires without         delivery, the carrying amount of the financial liability is reclassified to equity. An         entity&#x2019;s contractual obligation to purchase its own equity instruments gives rise to a         financial liability for the present value of the redemption amount even if the obligation to         purchase is conditional on the counterparty exercising a right to redeem (eg a written put         option that gives the counterparty the right to sell an entity&#x2019;s own equity instruments to         the entity for a fixed price).</p>                          </variant></body></paragraph>
