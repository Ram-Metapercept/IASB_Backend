The cumulative amount of the exchange differences is presented in a separate component of equity until disposal of the foreign operation. When the exchange differences relate to a foreign operation that is consolidated but not wholly&#x2011;owned, accumulated exchange differences arising from translation and attributable to non&#x2011;controlling interests are allocated to, and recognised as part of, non&#x2011;controlling interests in the consolidated statement of financial position.</p></body></paragraph>
