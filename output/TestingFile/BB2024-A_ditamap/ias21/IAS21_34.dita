This&#xa0;produces the same amounts in the functional currency as would have occurred had the items been recorded initially in the functional currency. For&#xa0;example, monetary items are translated into the functional currency using the closing rate, and non&#x2011;monetary items that are measured on a historical cost basis are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction  that resulted in their recognition.</p></body></paragraph>
