Accordingly, once the functional currency is determined, it can be changed only if there is a change to those underlying transactions, events and conditions. For&#xa0;example, a change in the currency that mainly influences the sales prices of goods and services may lead to a change in an entity&#x2019;s functional currency.</p></body></paragraph>
