Retrospective application of <xref id="IAS21_X0162" base="A21-120" href="IAS21_47.dita#IAS21_47">paragraph 47</xref> to earlier acquisitions is permitted. For an acquisition of a foreign operation treated prospectively but which occurred before the date on which this Standard is first applied, the entity shall not restate prior years and accordingly may, when appropriate, treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on that acquisition as assets and liabilities of the entity rather than as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation. Therefore, those goodwill and fair value adjustments either are already expressed in the entity’s functional currency or are non‑monetary foreign currency items, which are reported using the exchange rate at the date of the acquisition.</p></body></paragraph>
