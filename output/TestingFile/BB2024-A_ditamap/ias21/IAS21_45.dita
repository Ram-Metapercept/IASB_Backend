However, an intragroup monetary asset (or liability), whether short‑term or long‑term, cannot be eliminated against the corresponding intragroup liability (or asset) without showing the results of currency fluctuations in the consolidated financial statements. This is because the monetary item represents a commitment to convert one currency into another and exposes the reporting entity to a gain or loss through currency fluctuations. Accordingly, in the consolidated financial statements of the reporting entity, such an exchange difference is recognised in profit or loss or, if it arises from the circumstances described in <xref base="A21-114" href="IAS21_32.dita#IAS21_32" id="IAS21_X0132">paragraph 32</xref>, it is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity until the disposal of the foreign operation.</p></body></paragraph>
