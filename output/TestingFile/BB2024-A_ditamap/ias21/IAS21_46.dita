When this is not done, <xref base="F16164529" href="../ifrs10/IFRS10_TOC.dita#IFRS10_TOC0001" id="IAS21_X0133">IFRS 10</xref> allows the use of a different date provided that the difference is no greater than three months and adjustments are made for the effects of any significant transactions or other events that occur between the different dates.  In such a case, the assets and liabilities of the foreign operation are translated at the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period of the foreign operation. Adjustments are made for significant changes in exchange rates up to the end of the reporting period of the reporting entity in accordance with IFRS 10. The same approach is used in applying the equity method to associates and joint ventures in accordance with <xref base="F16219938" href="../ias28/IAS28_TOC.dita#IAS28_TOC0001" id="IAS21_X0135">IAS 28</xref> (as amended in 2011).</p></body></paragraph>
