If financial statements contain measurement inconsistencies, those financial statements may not faithfully represent some aspects of the entityâ€™s financial position and financial performance. Consequently, in some circumstances, using the same measurement basis for related assets and liabilities may provide users of financial statements with information that is more useful than the information that would result from using different measurement bases. This may be particularly likely when the cash flows from one asset or liability are directly linked to the cash flows from another asset or liability.</p></body></paragraph>
