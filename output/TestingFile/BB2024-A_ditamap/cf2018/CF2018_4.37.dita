For that potential to exist, it does not need to be certain, or even likely, that the entity will be required to transfer an economic resourceâ€”the transfer may, for example, be required only if a specified uncertain future event occurs. It is only necessary that the obligation already exists and that, in at least one circumstance, it would require the entity to transfer an economic resource.</p></body></paragraph>
