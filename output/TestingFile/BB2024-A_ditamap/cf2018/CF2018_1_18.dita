That information indicates the extent to which the reporting entity has increased its available economic resources, and thus its capacity for generating net cash inflows through its operations rather than by obtaining additional resources directly from investors and creditors. Information about a reporting entity&#x2019;s financial performance during a period can also help users to assess management&#x2019;s stewardship of the entity&#x2019;s economic resources.</p></body></paragraph>
