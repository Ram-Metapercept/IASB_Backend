In deciding how to account for contract modifications, it is necessary to consider which unit of account provides users of financial statements with the most useful information about the assets and liabilities retained after the modification, and about how the modification changed the entity&#x2019;s assets and liabilities: </p><ol outputclass="static" id="CF2018_L0049" base="F72786102" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="CF2018_P0352" base="F72786103">if a contract modification only eliminates existing rights or obligations, the discussion in paragraphs 5.26&#x2013;5.32 is considered in deciding whether to derecognise those rights or obligations;</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="CF2018_P0353" base="F72786105">if a contract modification only adds new rights or obligations, it is necessary to decide whether to treat the added rights or obligations as a separate asset or liability, or as part of the same unit of account as the existing rights and obligations (see paragraphs 4.48&#x2013;4.55); and</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="CF2018_P0354" base="F72786107">if a contract modification both eliminates existing rights or obligations and adds new rights or obligations, it is necessary to consider both the separate and the combined effect of those modifications. In some such cases, the contract has been modified to such an extent that, in substance, the modification replaces the old asset or liability with a new asset or liability. In cases of such extensive modification, the entity may need to derecognise the original asset or liability, and recognise the new asset or liability.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
