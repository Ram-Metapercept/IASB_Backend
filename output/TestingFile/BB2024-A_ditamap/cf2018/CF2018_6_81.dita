Hence, it may be appropriate to measure the asset acquired, or the liability incurred, at deemed cost, as described in paragraph&#xa0;6.6. Any difference between that deemed cost and any consideration given or received would be recognised as income or expenses at initial recognition.</p></body></paragraph>
