Assessing whether control exists helps to identify the economic resource for which the entity accounts. For example, an entity may control a proportionate share in a property without controlling the rights arising from ownership of the entire property. In such cases, the entityâ€™s asset is the share in the property, which it controls, not the rights arising from ownership of the entire property, which it does not control.</p></body></paragraph>
