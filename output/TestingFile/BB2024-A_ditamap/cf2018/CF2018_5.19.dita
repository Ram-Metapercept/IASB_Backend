In many cases, such measures must be estimated and are therefore subject to measurement uncertainty. As noted in paragraph&#xa0;2.19, the use of reasonable estimates is an essential part of the preparation of financial information and does not undermine the usefulness of the information if the estimates are clearly and accurately described and explained. Even a high level of measurement uncertainty does not necessarily prevent such an estimate from providing useful information.</p></body></paragraph>
