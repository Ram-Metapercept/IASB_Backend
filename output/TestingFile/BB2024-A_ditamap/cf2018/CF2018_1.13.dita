That information can help users to assess the reporting entity&#x2019;s liquidity and solvency, its needs for additional financing and how successful it is likely to be in obtaining that financing. That information can also help users to assess management&#x2019;s stewardship of the entity&#x2019;s economic resources. Information about priorities and payment requirements of existing claims helps users to predict how future cash flows will be distributed among those with a claim against the reporting entity.</p></body></paragraph>
