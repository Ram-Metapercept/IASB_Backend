The <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> establishes the concepts that underlie those estimates, judgements and models. The concepts are the goal towards which the Board and preparers of financial reports strive. As with most goals, the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph>â€™s vision of ideal financial reporting is unlikely to be achieved in full, at least not in the short term, because it takes time to understand, accept and implement new ways of analysing transactions and other events. Nevertheless, establishing a goal towards which to strive is essential if financial reporting is to evolve so as to improve its usefulness.</p></body></paragraph>
