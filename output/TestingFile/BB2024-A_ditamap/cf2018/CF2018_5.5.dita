For example, the sale of goods for cash results in the recognition of both income (from the recognition of one asset&#x2014;the cash) and an expense (from the derecognition of another asset&#x2014;the goods sold). The simultaneous recognition of income and related expenses is sometimes referred to as the matching of costs with income. Application of the concepts in the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> leads to such matching when it arises from the recognition of changes in assets and liabilities. However, matching of costs with income is not an objective of the <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph>. The <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph> does not allow the recognition in the statement of financial position of items that do not meet the definition of an asset, a liability or equity.</p></body></paragraph>
