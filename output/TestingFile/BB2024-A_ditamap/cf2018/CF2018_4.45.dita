The enactment of legislation is not in itself sufficient to give an entity a present obligation. Similarly, an entity&#x2019;s customary practice, published policy or specific statement of the type mentioned in paragraph 4.31 gives rise to a present obligation only when, as a consequence of obtaining economic benefits, or taking an action, to which that practice, policy or statement applies, the entity will or may have to transfer an economic resource that it would not otherwise have had to transfer.</p></body></paragraph>
