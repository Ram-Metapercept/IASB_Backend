The level of measurement uncertainty may be so high if, for example, the only way of estimating that measure of the asset or liability is by using cash-flow-based measurement techniques and, in addition, one or more of the following circumstances exists: </p><ol outputclass="static" id="CF2018_L0040" base="F72785978" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="CF2018_P0316" base="F72785979">the range of possible outcomes is exceptionally wide and the probability of each outcome is exceptionally difficult to estimate.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="CF2018_P0317" base="F72785991">the measure is exceptionally sensitive to small changes in estimates of the probability of different outcomes&#x2014;for example, if the probability of future cash inflows or outflows occurring is exceptionally low, but the magnitude of those cash inflows or outflows will be exceptionally high if they occur.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="CF2018_P0318" base="F72785993">measuring the asset or liability requires exceptionally difficult or exceptionally subjective allocations of cash flows that do not relate solely to the asset or liability being measured.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
