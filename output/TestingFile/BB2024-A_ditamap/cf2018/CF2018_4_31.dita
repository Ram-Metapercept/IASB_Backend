Obligations can also arise, however, from an entity&#x2019;s customary practices, published policies or specific statements if the entity has no practical ability to act in a manner inconsistent with those practices, policies or statements. The obligation that arises in such situations is sometimes referred to as a &#x2018;constructive obligation&#x2019;.</p></body></paragraph>
