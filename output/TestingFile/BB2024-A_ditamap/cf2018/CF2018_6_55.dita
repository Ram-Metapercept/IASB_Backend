For example, property, plant and equipment is typically used in combination with an entity&#x2019;s other economic resources. Similarly, inventory typically cannot be sold to a customer, except by making extensive use of the entity&#x2019;s other economic resources (for example, in production and marketing activities). Paragraphs 6.24&#x2013;6.31 and 6.40&#x2013;6.42 explain how measuring such assets at historical cost or current cost can provide relevant information that can be used to derive margins achieved during the period.</p></body></paragraph>
