The amounts of both the recognised financial assets and the recognised financial liabilities that are subject to set&#x2011;off under the same arrangement will be disclosed in both the financial asset and financial liability disclosures. However, the amounts disclosed (in, for example, a table) are limited to the amounts that are subject to set&#x2011;off. For example, an entity may have a recognised derivative asset and a recognised derivative liability that meet the offsetting criteria in <xref id="IFRS07_X1023" base="F19328170" href="../ias32/IAS32_42.dita#IAS32_42/IAS32_42_V2">paragraph 42 of IAS&#xa0;32</xref>. If the gross amount of the derivative asset is larger than the gross amount of the derivative liability, the financial asset disclosure table will include the entire amount of the derivative asset (in accordance with <xref id="IFRS07_X1024" base="F17328025" href="IFRS07_13C.dita#IFRS07_13C">paragraph&#xa0;13C(a)</xref>) and the entire amount of the derivative liability (in accordance with <xref id="IFRS07_X1025" base="F17328026" href="IFRS07_13C.dita#IFRS07_13C">paragraph 13C(b)</xref>). However, while the financial liability disclosure table will include the entire amount of the derivative liability (in accordance with <xref id="IFRS07_X1026" base="F17328023" href="IFRS07_13C.dita#IFRS07_13C">paragraph 13C(a)</xref>), it will only include the amount of the derivative asset (in accordance with <xref id="IFRS07_X1027" base="F17328024" href="IFRS07_13C.dita#IFRS07_13C">paragraph 13C(b)</xref>) that is equal to the amount of the derivative liability.</p></body></paragraph>
