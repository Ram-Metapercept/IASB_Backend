An entity shall apply that amendment for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009. If an entity applies IFRS 3 (revised 2008) for an earlier period, the amendment shall also be applied for that earlier period.

Instead, an entity shall account for such consideration in accordance with <xref base="F19328018" href="../ifrs03/IFRS03_65A.dita#IFRS03_65A" id="IFRS07_X0726">paragraphs 65A–65E of IFRS 3</xref> (as amended in 2010).</p></body></paragraph>
