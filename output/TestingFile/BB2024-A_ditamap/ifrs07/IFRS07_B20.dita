This applies even if such a methodology measures only the potential for loss and does not measure the potential for gain. Such an entity might comply with <xref id="IFRS07_X0966" base="SL210611" href="IFRS07_41.dita#IFRS07_41">paragraph 41(a)</xref> by disclosing the type of value‑at‑risk model used (eg whether the model relies on Monte Carlo simulations), an explanation about how the model works and the main assumptions (eg the holding period and confidence level). Entities might also disclose the historical observation period and weightings applied to observations within that period, an explanation of how options are dealt with in the calculations, and which volatilities and correlations (or, alternatively, Monte Carlo probability distribution simulations) are used.</p></body></paragraph>
