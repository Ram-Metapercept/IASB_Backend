In this Interpretation such obligations are referred to as ‘decommissioning, restoration and similar liabilities’. Under <xref id="IFRIC01_X0032" base="F398084" href="../IAS16.ditamap">IAS 16</xref>, the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment includes the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located, the obligation for which an entity incurs either when the item is acquired or as a consequence of having used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to produce inventories during that period.  <xref id="IFRIC01_X0034" base="F398085" href="../IAS37.ditamap">IAS 37</xref> contains requirements on how to measure decommissioning, restoration and similar liabilities.  This Interpretation provides guidance on how to account for the effect of changes in the measurement of existing decommissioning, restoration and similar liabilities.</p></body></paragraph>
