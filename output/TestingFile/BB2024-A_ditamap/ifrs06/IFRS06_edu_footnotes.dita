The IFRIC was asked if this limited scope (a) reflected the Board&#x2019;s intention to impose limits on current national GAAP practices only in respect of activities conducted in the E&amp;E phase, while permitting industry practices in other extractive industry areas (eg development and exploitation) to continue unchanged, or (b) whether the IASB focused on E&amp;E activities because it was the only area for which the IASB was willing to grant some relief from the hierarchy for selection of accounting policies in&#xa0;<xref base="F1872754" href="../ias08/IAS08_TOC.dita#IAS08_TOC0001" id="IFRS06_X0252">IAS&#xa0;8</xref>. Under the latter view, the IAS&#xa0;8 hierarchy would apply fully to an entity&#x2019;s selection of IFRS accounting policies for activities outside the E&amp;E phase. The submission identified some inconsistencies between current extractive industry full&#x2011;cost accounting practices in respect of development and exploitation activities but questioned whether the IASB intended to require change from current practices in these areas in advance of a comprehensive extractive industry project.</p>       <p>The IFRIC noted that the effect of the limited scope of IFRS&#xa0;6 was to grant relief only to policies in respect of E&amp;E activities, and that this relief did not extend to activities before or after the E&amp;E phase.

The IFRIC believed it was clear that the scope of IFRS&#xa0;6 consistently limited the relief from the hierarchy to policies applied to E&amp;E activities and that there was no basis for interpreting IFRS&#xa0;6 as granting any additional relief in areas outside its scope. Therefore, the IFRIC believed that diversity in practice should not become established and decided not to add the issue to its agenda.]</p>       </fn><fn base="IFRS06_13" id="IFRS06_FN0003">              <p id="IFRS06_P0202">[The term &#x2018;faithful representation&#x2019;, which was used in the&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph>&#xa0;issued in 2010 and is also used in the revised version of the&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph>&#xa0;issued in 2018, encompasses the main characteristics that the&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph>&#xa0;called &#x2018;reliability&#x2019; (refer&#xa0;<xref href="../cf2018/CF2018_g2.12-2.19.dita" scope="local"><ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual Framework</ph></ph>&#xa0;paragraphs 2.12&#x2013;2.19</xref>&#xa0;and&#xa0;<xref href="../cf2018/CF2018_gBC2.21-BC2.51.dita" scope="local">Basis for Conclusions paragraphs BC2.21&#x2013;BC2.31</xref>).]</p>       </fn></bodydiv></body></topic>
