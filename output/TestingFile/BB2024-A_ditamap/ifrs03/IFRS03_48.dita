However, new information obtained during the measurement period may sometimes result in an adjustment to the provisional amount of more than one asset or liability. For example, the acquirer might have assumed a liability to pay damages related to an accident in one of the&#xa0;acquiree&#x2019;s&#xa0;facilities, part or all of which are covered by the acquiree&#x2019;s liability insurance policy. If the acquirer obtains new information during the measurement period about the&#xa0;acquisition&#x2011;date&#xa0;fair value&#xa0;of that liability, the adjustment to goodwill resulting from a change to the provisional amount recognised for the liability would be offset (in whole or in part) by a corresponding adjustment to goodwill resulting from a change to the provisional amount recognised for the claim receivable from the insurer.</p></body></paragraph>
