Examples include strategic management processes, operational processes and resource management processes. These processes typically are documented, but the intellectual capacity of an organised workforce having the necessary skills and experience following rules and conventions may provide the necessary processes that are capable of being applied to inputs to create outputs. (Accounting, billing, payroll and other administrative systems typically are not processes used to create outputs.)</p>         </li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value>           <p id="IFRS03_P0346_V2"><b>Output:</b>&#xa0;The result of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that provide goods or services to customers, generate investment income (such as dividends or interest) or generate other income from ordinary activities.           </p>         </li></ol>     </variant></body></paragraph>
