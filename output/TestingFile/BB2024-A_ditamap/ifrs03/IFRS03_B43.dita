For example, that might be the case for an acquired research and development intangible asset that the acquirer plans to use defensively by preventing others from using it. Nevertheless, the acquirer shall measure the fair value of the non&#x2011;financial asset assuming its highest and best use by market participants in accordance with the appropriate valuation premise,  both initially and when measuring fair value less costs of disposal for subsequent impairment testing.</p></body></paragraph>
