For example, costs the acquirer expects but is not obliged to incur in the         future to effect its plan to exit an activity of an acquiree or to terminate the employment of or relocate         an acquiree’s employees are not liabilities at the acquisition date. Therefore, the acquirer         does not recognise those costs as part of applying the acquisition method. Instead, the         acquirer recognises those costs in its post‑combination financial statements in accordance         with other IFRSs.</p>            </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
