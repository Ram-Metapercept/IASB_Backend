For example, if the market&#x2011;based measure of the portion of a replacement award attributed to pre-combination service is CU100 and the acquirer expects that only 95&#xa0;per cent of the award will vest, the amount included in consideration transferred in the business combination is CU95. Changes in the estimated number of replacement awards expected to vest are reflected in remuneration cost for the periods in which the changes or forfeitures occur not as adjustments to the consideration transferred in the business combination. Similarly, the effects of other events, such as modifications or the ultimate outcome of awards with performance conditions, that occur after the acquisition date are accounted for in accordance with IFRS&#xa0;2 in determining remuneration cost for the period in which an event occurs.</p></body></paragraph>
