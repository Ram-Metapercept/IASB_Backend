For example, an acquirer may attribute value to the existence of an assembled workforce, which is an existing collection of employees that permits the acquirer to continue to operate an acquired&#xa0;business&#xa0;from the acquisition date. An assembled workforce does not represent the intellectual capital of the skilled workforce&#x2014;the (often specialised) knowledge and experience that employees of an&#xa0;acquiree&#xa0;bring to their jobs. Because the assembled workforce is not an identifiable asset to be recognised separately from goodwill, any value attributed to it is subsumed into goodwill.</p></body></paragraph>
