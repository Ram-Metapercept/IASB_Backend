Sometimes an acquirer will be able to measure the acquisition&#x2011;date fair value of a non&#x2011;controlling interest on the basis of a quoted price in an active market  for the equity shares (ie those not held by the acquirer). In other situations, however, a quoted price in an active market for the equity shares will not be available. In those situations, the acquirer would measure the fair value of the non&#x2011;controlling interest using other valuation techniques. </p></body></paragraph>
