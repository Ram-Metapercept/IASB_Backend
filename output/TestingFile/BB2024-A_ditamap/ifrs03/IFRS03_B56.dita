Exchanges of share options or other share&#x2011;based payment awards in conjunction with a business combination are accounted for as modifications of share&#x2011;based payment awards in accordance with <xref base="F5312028" href="../ifrs02/IFRS02_TOC.dita#IFRS02_TOC0001" id="IFRS03_X0470">IFRS&#xa0;2 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Share&#x2011;based Payment</ph></ph></xref>.

That is to say, none of the market&#x2011;based measure of those awards shall be included in measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination. The acquirer is obliged to replace the acquiree awards if the acquiree or its employees have the ability to enforce replacement.
