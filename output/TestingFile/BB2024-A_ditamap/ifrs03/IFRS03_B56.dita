Exchanges of share options or other share‑based payment awards in conjunction with a business combination are accounted for as modifications of share‑based payment awards in accordance with <xref base="F5312028" href="../ifrs02/IFRS02_TOC.dita#IFRS02_TOC0001" id="IFRS03_X0470">IFRS 2 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Share‑based Payment</ph></ph></xref>. If the acquirer replaces the acquiree awards, either all or a portion of the market‑based measure of the acquirer’s replacement awards shall be included in measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination. <xref base="F14540100" href="IFRS03_B57.dita#IFRS03_B57" id="IFRS03_X0471">Paragraphs B57–B62</xref> provide guidance on how to allocate the market‑based measure.

That is to say, none of the market‑based measure of those awards shall be included in measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination.
