However, the criteria neither provide guidance for measuring the fair value of an intangible asset nor restrict the assumptions used in measuring the fair value of an intangible asset. For example, the acquirer would take into account the assumptions that market participants  would use when pricing the intangible asset, such as expectations of future contract renewals, in measuring fair value. It is not necessary for the renewals themselves to meet the identifiability criteria. (However, see paragraph 29, which establishes an exception to the fair value measurement principle for reacquired rights recognised in a business combination.) <xref id="IFRS03_X0434" base="F5311843" href="../ias38/IAS38_36.dita#IAS38_36">Paragraphs 36 and 37 of IAS 38</xref> provide guidance for determining whether intangible assets should be combined into a single unit of account with other intangible or tangible assets.</p></body></paragraph>
