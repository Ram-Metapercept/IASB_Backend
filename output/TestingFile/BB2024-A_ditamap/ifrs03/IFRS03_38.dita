If so, the acquirer shall remeasure the transferred assets or liabilities to their fair values as of the acquisition date and recognise the resulting gains or losses, if any, in profit or loss. However, sometimes the transferred assets or liabilities remain within the combined entity after the&#xa0;business combination&#xa0;(for example, because the assets or liabilities were transferred to the&#xa0;acquiree&#xa0;rather than to its former&#xa0;owners), and the acquirer therefore retains&#xa0;control&#xa0;of them. In that situation, the acquirer shall measure those assets and liabilities at their carrying amounts immediately before the acquisition date and shall not recognise a gain or loss in profit or loss on assets or liabilities it&#xa0;controls&#xa0;both before and after the business combination.</p></body></paragraph>
