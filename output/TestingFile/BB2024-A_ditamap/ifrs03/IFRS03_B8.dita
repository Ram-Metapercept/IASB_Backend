To be capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose identified in the definition of a business, an integrated set of activities and assets requires two essential elements&#x2014;inputs and processes applied to those inputs. A&#xa0;business&#xa0;need not include all of the inputs or processes that the seller used in operating that business.                  However, to be considered a business, an integrated set of activities and assets must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output. Paragraphs B12&#x2013;B12D specify how to assess whether a process is substantive.</p>            </variant></body></paragraph>
