(However, any       portion of the acquirer’s share‑based payment awards exchanged for awards held by the       acquiree’s employees that is included in consideration transferred in the business combination       shall be measured in accordance with <xref href="IFRS03_g30-30.dita" scope="local" id="IFRS03_X0236">paragraph 30</xref> rather than at fair value.) Examples of potential       forms of consideration include cash, other assets, a business or a subsidiary of the acquirer, <i>contingent           consideration</i>,          ordinary or preference equity instruments, options,       warrants and member interests of <i>mutual entities</i>.</p></body></paragraph>
