If so, the acquirer shall determine the amount of goodwill by using the acquisition‑date fair value of the acquiree’s equity interests instead of the acquisition‑date fair value of the equity interests transferred. To determine the amount of goodwill in a business combination in which no consideration is transferred, the acquirer shall use the acquisition‑date fair value of the acquirer’s interest in the acquiree in place of the acquisition‑date fair value of the consideration transferred (<xref id="IFRS03_X0226" base="F5310271" href="IFRS03_32.dita#IFRS03_32">paragraph 32(a)(i)</xref>). <xref id="IFRS03_X0227" base="F5310272" href="IFRS03_gB46-B49.dita#IFRS03_gB46-B49">Paragraphs B46–B49</xref> provide related application guidance.</p></body></paragraph>
