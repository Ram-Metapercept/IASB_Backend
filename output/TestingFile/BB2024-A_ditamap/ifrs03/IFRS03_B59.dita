Therefore, the acquirer attributes any excess of the market&#x2011;based measure of the replacement award over the market&#x2011;based measure of the acquiree award to post&#x2011;combination service and recognises that excess as remuneration cost in the post-combination financial statements. The acquirer shall attribute a portion of a replacement award to post&#x2011;combination service if it requires post&#x2011;combination service, regardless of whether employees had rendered all of the service required for their acquiree awards to vest before the acquisition date.</p></body></paragraph>
