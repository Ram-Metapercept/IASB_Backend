Therefore, the acquirer attributes any excess of the market‑based measure of the replacement award over the market‑based measure of the acquiree award to post‑combination service and recognises that excess as remuneration cost in the post-combination financial statements. The acquirer shall attribute a portion of a replacement award to post‑combination service if it requires post‑combination service, regardless of whether employees had rendered all of the service required for their acquiree awards to vest before the acquisition date.</p></body></paragraph>
