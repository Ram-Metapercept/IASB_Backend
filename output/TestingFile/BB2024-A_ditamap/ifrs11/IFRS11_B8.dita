The contractual arrangement between A, B and C specifies that at least 75&#xa0;per cent of the voting rights are required to make decisions about the relevant activities of the arrangement.

The terms of their contractual arrangement requiring at least 75&#xa0;per&#xa0;cent of the voting rights to make decisions about the relevant activities imply that A and B have joint control of the arrangement because decisions about the relevant activities of the arrangement cannot be made without both A and B agreeing.                                </p>             </entry></row><row><entry colname="C1">               <p id="IFRS11_P0114" typeface="sansserif"><b>Example 2</b></p>               <p id="IFRS11_P0115" base="F16125680">Assume an arrangement has three parties: A has 50&#xa0;per cent of the voting rights in the arrangement and B and C each have 25&#xa0;per cent. The contractual arrangement between A, B and C specifies that at least 75&#xa0;per&#xa0;cent of the voting rights are required to make decisions about the relevant activities of the arrangement. Even though A can block any decision, it does not control the arrangement because it needs the agreement of either B or C. In this example, A, B and C collectively control the arrangement. However, there is more than one combination of parties that can agree to reach 75&#xa0;per&#xa0;cent of the voting rights (ie either A and B or A and C). In such a situation, to be a joint arrangement the contractual arrangement between the parties would need to specify which combination of the parties is required to agree unanimously to decisions about the relevant activities of the arrangement.                                </p>             </entry></row><row><entry colname="C1">               <p id="IFRS11_P0116" typeface="sansserif"><b>Example 3</b></p>               <p id="IFRS11_P0117" base="F16125682">Assume an arrangement in which A and B each have 35&#xa0;per cent of the voting rights in the arrangement with the remaining 30&#xa0;per cent being widely dispersed.
