For example, the contractual arrangement might establish that revenues and expenses are allocated on the basis of the capacity that each party uses in a plant operated jointly, which could differ from their ownership interest in the joint arrangement. In other instances, the parties might have agreed to share the profit or loss relating to the arrangement on the basis of a specified proportion such as the parties&#x2019; ownership interest in the arrangement. This would not prevent the arrangement from being a joint operation if the parties have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement.</p></entry><entry colname="C3" align="left" valign="top"> <p id="IFRS11_P0172" base="F16125776">The contractual arrangement establishes each party&#x2019;s share in the profit or loss relating to the activities of the arrangement.</p></entry></row><row><entry colname="C1" align="left" valign="top"> <p id="IFRS11_P0173" base="F16125765"><b>Guarantees</b></p></entry><entry namest="C2" nameend="C3" align="left" valign="top"> <p id="IFRS11_P0174" base="F16125771">The parties to joint arrangements are often required to provide guarantees to third parties that, for example, receive a service from, or provide financing to, the joint arrangement. The provision of such guarantees, or the commitment by the parties to provide them, does not, by itself, determine that the joint arrangement is a joint operation. The feature that determines whether the joint arrangement is a joint operation or a joint venture is whether the parties have obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement (for some of which the parties might or might not have provided a guarantee).</p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></body></paragraph>
