Joint control exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties that collectively control the arrangement.  Assessing whether the arrangement is jointly controlled by all of its parties or by a group of the parties, or controlled by one of its parties alone, can require judgement.</p></body></paragraph>
