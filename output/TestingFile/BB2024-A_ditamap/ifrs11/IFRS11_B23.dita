In such a case, the assessment of the rights and obligations conferred upon the parties by the legal form of the separate vehicle indicates that the arrangement is a joint venture. However, the terms agreed by the parties in their contractual arrangement (see <xref id="IFRS11_X0175" base="F16218815" href="IFRS11_gB25-B28.dita#IFRS11_gB25-B28">paragraphs B25–B28</xref>) and, when relevant, other facts and circumstances (see <xref id="IFRS11_X0176" base="F16218816" href="IFRS11_gB29-B32.dita#IFRS11_gB29-B32">paragraphs B29–B33</xref>) can override the assessment of the rights and obligations conferred upon the parties by the legal form of the separate vehicle.</p></body></paragraph>
