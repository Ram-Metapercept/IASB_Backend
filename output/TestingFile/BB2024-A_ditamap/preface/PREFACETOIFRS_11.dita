The Board&#x2019;s       objective is to require like transactions and events to be accounted for and reported in a       like way and unlike transactions and events to be accounted for and reported differently, both       within an entity over time and among entities. Consequently, the Board intends not to permit       choices in accounting treatment. Also, the Board has reconsidered, and will continue to       reconsider, those transactions and events for which Standards permit a choice of accounting       treatment, with the objective of reducing the number of those choices.</p></body></paragraph>
