When financial statements are used to monitor       compliance with contracts and agreements, a new Standard may have consequences that were not       foreseen when the contract or agreement was finalised. For example, covenants contained in       banking and loan agreements may impose limits on measures shown in a borrowerâ€™s financial       statements. The Board believes the fact that financial reporting requirements evolve and       change over time is well understood and would be known to the parties when they entered into       the agreement. It is up to the parties to determine whether the agreement should be insulated       from the effects of a future Standard, or, if not, the manner in which the agreement might be       renegotiated to reflect changes in reporting rather than changes in the underlying financial       condition.</p></body></paragraph>
