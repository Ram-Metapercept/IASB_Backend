In this case the effectiveness of both hedges would be computed by reference to Parent&#x2019;s functional currency (euro). Consequently, both the USD/GBP change in value of the external borrowing held by Subsidiary&#xa0;B and the GBP/EUR change in value of Parent&#x2019;s loan payable to Subsidiary&#xa0;B (equivalent to USD/EUR in total) would be included in the foreign currency translation reserve in Parent&#x2019;s consolidated financial statements. Because Parent has already fully hedged the EUR/USD risk from its net investment in Subsidiary&#xa0;C, it can hedge only up to &#xa3;341 million for the EUR/GBP risk of its net investment in Subsidiary&#xa0;B.</p></body></paragraph>
