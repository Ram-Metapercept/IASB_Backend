In the ultimate parent’s consolidated financial statements, the aggregate net amount recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve in respect of all foreign operations is not affected by the consolidation method. However, whether the ultimate parent uses the direct or the step‑by‑step method of consolidation<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRIC16_FN0002" type="fn"/> may affect the amount included in its foreign currency translation reserve in respect of an individual foreign operation. The use of the step‑by‑step method of consolidation may result in the reclassification to profit or loss of an amount different from that used to determine hedge effectiveness. This difference may be eliminated by determining the amount relating to that foreign operation that would have arisen if the direct method of consolidation had been used. Making this adjustment is not required by <xref base="F7018267" href="../ias21/IAS21_TOC.dita#IAS21_TOC0001" id="IFRIC16_X0065">IAS 21</xref>. However, it is an accounting policy choice that should be followed consistently for all net investments.</p></body></paragraph>
