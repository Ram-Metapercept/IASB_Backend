Because both its assets and liabilities increased by £159 million, Subsidiary B’s net assets are unchanged. Subsidiary B could designate the external debt as a hedge of the GBP/USD risk of its net investment in Subsidiary C in its consolidated financial statements. Parent could maintain Subsidiary B’s designation of that hedging instrument as a hedge of its US$300 million net investment in Subsidiary C for the GBP/USD risk (see paragraph 13) and Parent could designate the GBP hedging instrument it holds as a hedge of its entire £500 million net investment in Subsidiary B. The first hedge, designated by Subsidiary B, would be assessed by reference to Subsidiary B’s functional currency (pounds sterling) and the second hedge, designated by Parent, would be assessed by reference to Parent’s functional currency (euro). In this case, only the GBP/USD risk from Parent’s net investment in Subsidiary C has been hedged in Parent’s consolidated financial statements by the USD hedging instrument, not the entire EUR/USD risk. Therefore, the entire EUR/GBP risk from Parent’s £500 million net investment in Subsidiary B may be hedged in the consolidated financial statements of Parent.</p></body></paragraph>
