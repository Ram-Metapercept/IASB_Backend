However, in the case described in <xref id="IFRIC16_X0089" base="F7018301" href="IFRIC16_AG10.dita#IFRIC16_AG10">paragraph AG10(a)</xref>, by its designation of the USD hedging instrument it holds, Parent has already fully hedged the EUR/USD risk from its net investment in Subsidiary C. If Parent also designated a GBP instrument it holds as a hedge of its £500 million net investment in Subsidiary B, £159 million of that net investment, representing the GBP equivalent of its USD net investment in Subsidiary C, would be hedged twice for GBP/EUR risk in Parent’s consolidated financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
