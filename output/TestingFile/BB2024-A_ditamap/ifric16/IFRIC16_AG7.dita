Both amounts are included for the purpose of assessing the effectiveness of the hedge designated in <xref id="IFRIC16_X0082" base="F7018299" href="IFRIC16_AG4.dita#IFRIC16_AG4">paragraph AG4</xref> because the change in value of both the hedging instrument and the hedged item are computed by reference to the euro functional currency of Parent against the US&#xa0;dollar functional currency of Subsidiary&#xa0;C, in accordance with the hedge documentation.
