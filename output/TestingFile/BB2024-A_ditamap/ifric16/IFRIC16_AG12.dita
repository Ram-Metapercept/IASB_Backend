The remainder of the change (equivalent to the GBP/EUR change on £159 million) is included in Parent’s consolidated profit or loss, as in <xref id="IFRIC16_X0091" base="F7018303" href="IFRIC16_AG5.dita#IFRIC16_AG5">paragraph AG5</xref>. Because the designation of the USD/GBP risk between Subsidiaries B and C does not include the GBP/EUR risk, Parent is also able to designate up to £500 million of its net investment in Subsidiary B with the risk being the spot foreign exchange exposure (GBP/EUR) between Parent and Subsidiary B.</p></body></paragraph>
