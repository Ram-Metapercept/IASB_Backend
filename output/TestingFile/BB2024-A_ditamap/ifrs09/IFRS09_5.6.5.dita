However, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is removed from equity and adjusted against the fair value of the financial asset at the reclassification date. As a result, the financial asset is measured at the reclassification date as if it had always been measured at amortised cost. This adjustment affects other comprehensive income but does not affect profit or loss and therefore is not a reclassification adjustment (see <xref base="F41826687" href="../ias01/IAS01_TOC.dita#IAS01_TOC0001" id="IFRS09_X0569">IAS&#xa0;1 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Presentation of Financial Statements</ph></ph></xref>). The effective interest rate and the measurement of expected credit losses are not adjusted as a result of the reclassification.
