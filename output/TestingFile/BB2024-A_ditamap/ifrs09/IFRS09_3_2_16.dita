The extent of the entity&#x2019;s continuing involvement in the transferred asset is the extent to which it is exposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset.

However, in the case of a written put option on an asset that is measured at fair value , the extent of the entity&#x2019;s continuing involvement is limited to the lower of the fair value of the transferred asset and the option exercise price (see <xref base="F41456119" href="IFRS09_B3_2_13.dita#IFRS09_B3_2_13" id="IFRS09_X0298">paragraph&#xa0;B3.2.13</xref>).</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p base="SL32569793" id="IFRS09_P0172">When the entity&#x2019;s continuing involvement takes the form of a cash&#x2011;settled option or similar provision on the transferred asset, the extent of the entity&#x2019;s continuing involvement is measured in the same way as that which results from non&#x2011;cash settled options as set out in (b) above.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
