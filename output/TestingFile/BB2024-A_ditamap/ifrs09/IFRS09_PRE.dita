However, in response to requests from interested parties that the accounting for financial instruments should be improved quickly, the Board divided its project to replace IAS&#xa0;39 into three main phases. As the Board completed each phase, it issued chapters in IFRS&#xa0;9 that replaced the corresponding requirements in IAS&#xa0;39.</p><p base="F38150620" id="IFRS09_P0003">In November 2009 the Board issued the chapters of IFRS&#xa0;9 relating to the classification and measurement of financial assets. In October 2010 the Board added the requirements related to the classification and measurement of financial liabilities to IFRS&#xa0;9. This includes requirements on embedded derivatives and how to account for changes in own credit risk on financial liabilities designated under the fair value option.</p><p base="F38150621" id="IFRS09_P0004">In October 2010 the Board also decided to carry forward unchanged from IAS&#xa0;39 the requirements related to the derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. Because of these changes, in October 2010 the Board restructured IFRS&#xa0;9 and its Basis for Conclusions. In December 2011 the Board deferred the mandatory effective date of IFRS&#xa0;9.</p><variants id="IFRS09_P0005">              <p id="IFRS09_P0005_V2">In November 2013 the Board added a Hedge Accounting chapter. IFRS 9 permits an entity to choose as its accounting policy either to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9 or to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements in IAS 39. Consequently, although IFRS 9 is effective (with limited exceptions for entities that issue insurance contracts and entities applying the&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">IFRS for SMEs</ph></ph>&#xa0;Standard), IAS 39, which now contains only its requirements for hedge accounting, also remains effective.</p>     </variants><p base="F38150623" id="IFRS09_P0006">In July 2014 the Board issued the completed version of IFRS&#xa0;9. The Board made limited amendments to the classification and measurement requirements for financial assets by addressing a narrow range of application questions and by introducing a &#x2018;fair value through other comprehensive income&#x2019; measurement category for particular simple debt instruments. The Board also added the impairment requirements relating to the accounting for an entity&#x2019;s expected credit losses on its financial assets and commitments to extend credit. A new mandatory effective date was also set.</p><variants id="IFRS09_P0007">       <p base="F59119929" id="IFRS09_P0007_V1">In May 2017 when IFRS&#xa0;17&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Insurance Contracts</ph></ph>&#xa0;was issued, it amended the derecognition requirements in IFRS&#xa0;9 by permitting an exemption for when an entity repurchases its financial liability in specific circumstances.</p>     </variants><variants id="IFRS09_P0008">       <p base="F65831611" id="IFRS09_P0008_V1">In October 2017 IFRS&#xa0;9 was amended by&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation</ph></ph>&#xa0;(Amendments to IFRS&#xa0;9).
