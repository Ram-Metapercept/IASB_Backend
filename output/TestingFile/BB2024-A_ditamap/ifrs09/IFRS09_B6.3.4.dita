However, the items that constitute the aggregated exposure remain accounted for separately.  This means that, for example:</p><ol outputclass="static" id="IFRS09_L0141" base="SL32626719" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P1499" base="SL32626721">derivatives that are part of an aggregated exposure are recognised as separate assets or liabilities measured at fair value; and</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P1500" base="SL32626723">if a hedging relationship is designated between the items that constitute the aggregated exposure, the way in which a derivative is included as part of an aggregated exposure must be consistent with the designation of that derivative as the hedging instrument at the level of the aggregated exposure. For example, if an entity excludes the forward element of a derivative from its designation as the hedging instrument for the hedging relationship between the items that constitute the aggregated exposure, it must also exclude the forward element when including that derivative as a hedged item as part of the aggregated exposure. Otherwise, the aggregated exposure shall include a derivative, either in its entirety or a proportion of it.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
