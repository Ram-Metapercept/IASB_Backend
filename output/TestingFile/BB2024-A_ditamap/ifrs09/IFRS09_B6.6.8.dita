Both sales and purchases are denominated in the same foreign currency. In order to sufficiently specify the designation of the hedged net position, the entity specifies in the original documentation of the hedging relationship that sales can be of Product A or Product B and purchases can be of Machinery Type A, Machinery Type B and Raw Material A. The entity also specifies the volumes of the transactions by each nature. The entity documents that the bottom layer of sales (FC100) is made up of a forecast sales volume of the first FC70 of Product A and the first FC30 of Product B. If those sales volumes are expected to affect profit or loss in different reporting periods, the entity would include that in the documentation, for example, the first FC70 from sales of Product A that are expected to affect profit or loss in the first reporting period and the first FC30 from sales of Product B that are expected to affect profit or loss in the second reporting period. The entity also documents that the bottom layer of the purchases (FC150) is made up of purchases of the first FC60 of Machinery Type A, the first FC40 of Machinery Type B and the first FC50 of Raw Material A. If those purchase volumes are expected to affect profit or loss in different reporting periods, the entity would include in the documentation a disaggregation of the purchase volumes by the reporting periods in which they are expected to affect profit or loss (similarly to how it documents the sales volumes). For example, the forecast transaction would be specified as:</p><ol outputclass="static" id="IFRS09_L0172" base="SL32627026" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P1695" base="SL32627028">the first FC60 of purchases of Machinery Type A that are expected to affect profit or loss from the third reporting period over the next ten&#xa0;reporting periods;</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P1696" base="SL32627030">the first FC40 of purchases of Machinery Type B that are expected to affect profit or loss from the fourth reporting period over the next 20&#xa0;reporting periods; and</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P1697" base="SL32627032">the first FC50 of purchases of Raw Material A that are expected to be received in the third reporting period and sold, ie affect profit or loss, in that and the next reporting period.</p></li></ol><p id="IFRS09_P1698" base="SL32627033">Specifying the nature of the forecast transaction volumes would include aspects such as the depreciation pattern for items of property, plant and equipment of the same kind, if the nature of those items is such that the depreciation pattern could vary depending on how the entity uses those items. For example, if the entity uses items of Machinery Type A in two different production processes that result in straight-line depreciation over ten reporting periods and the units of production method respectively, its documentation of the forecast purchase volume for Machinery Type A would disaggregate that volume by which of those depreciation patterns will apply.</p></body></paragraph>
