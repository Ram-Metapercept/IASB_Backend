Despite the requirement in <xref id="IFRS09_X1381" base="F70459229" href="IFRS09_g5.5.9-5.5.11.dita#IFRS09_g5.5.9-5.5.11/IFRS09_g5.5.9-5.5.11_TI">paragraph 5.5.9</xref>, for financial instruments for which default patterns are not concentrated at a specific point during the expected life of the financial instrument, changes in the risk of a default occurring over the next 12 months may be a reasonable approximation of the changes in the lifetime risk of a default occurring. In such cases, an entity may use changes in the risk of a default occurring over the next 12 months to determine whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, unless circumstances indicate that a lifetime assessment is necessary. </p></body></paragraph>
