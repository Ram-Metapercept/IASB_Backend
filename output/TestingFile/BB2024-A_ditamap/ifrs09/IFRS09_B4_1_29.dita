Those requirements can create a measurement or recognition inconsistency (sometimes referred to as an &#x2018;accounting mismatch&#x2019;) when, for example, in the absence of designation as at fair value through profit or loss, a financial asset would be classified as subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss and a liability the entity considers related would be subsequently measured at amortised cost (with changes in fair value not recognised). In such circumstances, an entity may conclude that its financial statements would provide more relevant information if both the asset and the liability were measured as at fair value through profit or loss.</p></body></paragraph>
