If the counterparty to that derivative experiences a severe deterioration in its credit standing, the effect of the changes in the counterparty&#x2019;s credit standing might outweigh the effect of changes in the commodity price on the fair value of the hedging instrument, whereas changes in the value of the hedged item depend largely on the commodity price changes.</p></body></paragraph>
