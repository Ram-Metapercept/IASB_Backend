The gross carrying amount of the financial asset shall be recalculated as the present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows that are discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate (or credit-adjusted effective interest rate for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets) or, when applicable, the revised effective interest rate calculated in accordance with <xref base="F41732419" href="IFRS09_6.5.10.dita#IFRS09_6.5.10" id="IFRS09_X0446">paragraph 6.5.10</xref>.
