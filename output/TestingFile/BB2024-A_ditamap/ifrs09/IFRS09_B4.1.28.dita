When an entity has such a choice, <xref id="IFRS09_X1268" base="F69953755" href="../ias08/IAS08_g14-31.dita#IAS08_g14-31/IAS08_g14-31_TI">paragraph&#xa0;14(b) of IAS&#xa0;8</xref> requires the chosen policy to result in the financial statements providing reliable and more relevant information about the effects of transactions, other events and conditions on the entity&#x2019;s financial position, financial performance or cash flows. For example, in the case of designation of a financial liability as at fair value through profit or loss, <xref id="IFRS09_X1269" base="F69953756" href="IFRS09_g4.2.2-4.2.2.dita#IFRS09_g4.2.2-4.2.2/IFRS09_g4.2.2-4.2.2_TI">paragraph&#xa0;4.2.2</xref> sets out the two circumstances when the requirement for more relevant information will be met. Accordingly, to choose such designation in accordance with paragraph&#xa0;4.2.2, the entity needs to demonstrate that it falls within one (or both) of these two circumstances.</p></body></paragraph>
