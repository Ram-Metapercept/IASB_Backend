This typically means measuring the loss allowance at an amount equal to 12&#x2011;month expected credit losses until the requirements for the recognition of lifetime expected credit losses in paragraph&#xa0;5.5.3 are met. However, in some unusual circumstances following a modification that results in derecognition of the original financial asset, there may be evidence that the modified financial asset is credit-impaired at initial recognition, and thus, the financial asset should be recognised as an originated credit&#x2011;impaired financial asset.  This might occur, for example, in a situation in which there was a substantial modification of a distressed asset that resulted in the derecognition of the original financial asset . In such a case, it may be possible for the modification to result in a new financial asset which is credit&#x2011;impaired at initial recognition.</p></body></paragraph>
