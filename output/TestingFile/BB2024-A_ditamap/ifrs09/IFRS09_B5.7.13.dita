The requirement in <xref base="F70603298" href="IFRS09_g5.7.7-5.7.9.dita#IFRS09_g5.7.7-5.7.9/IFRS09_g5.7.7-5.7.9_TI" id="IFRS09_X1502">paragraph 5.7.7(a)</xref> relates to the risk that the issuer will fail to perform on that particular liability. It does not necessarily relate to the creditworthiness of the issuer. For example, if an entity issues a collateralised liability and a non‑collateralised liability that are otherwise identical, the credit risk of those two liabilities will be different, even though they are issued by the same entity. The credit risk on the collateralised liability will be less than the credit risk of the non‑collateralised liability. The credit risk for a collateralised liability may be close to zero.</p></body></paragraph>
