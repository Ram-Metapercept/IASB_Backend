However, if an entity has a history of having designated hedges of forecast transactions and having subsequently determined that the forecast transactions are no longer expected to occur, the entity&#x2019;s ability to predict forecast transactions accurately is called into question when predicting similar forecast transactions. This affects the assessment of whether similar forecast transactions are highly probable (see <xref id="IFRS09_X1601" base="F43475299" href="IFRS09_6_3_3.dita#IFRS09_6_3_3">paragraph 6.3.3</xref>) and hence whether they are eligible as hedged items.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
