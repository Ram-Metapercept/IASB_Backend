Both the amortised cost measurement category and the fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category require that the effective interest rate is determined at initial recognition. Both of those measurement categories also require that the impairment requirements are applied in the same way. Consequently, when an entity reclassifies a financial asset between the amortised cost measurement category and the fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category:</p><ol outputclass="static" id="IFRS09_L0136" base="F32626651" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P1436" base="F32626652">the recognition of interest revenue will not change and therefore the entity continues to use the same effective interest rate.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P1437" base="F32626654">the measurement of expected credit losses will not change because both measurement categories apply the same impairment approach. However if a financial asset is reclassified out of the fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category and into the amortised cost measurement category, a loss allowance would be recognised as an adjustment to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset from the reclassification date. If a financial asset is reclassified out of the amortised cost measurement category and into the fair value through other comprehensive income measurement category, the loss allowance would be derecognised (and thus would no longer be recognised as an adjustment to the gross carrying amount) but instead would be recognised as an accumulated impairment amount (of an equal amount) in other comprehensive income and would be disclosed from the reclassification date.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
