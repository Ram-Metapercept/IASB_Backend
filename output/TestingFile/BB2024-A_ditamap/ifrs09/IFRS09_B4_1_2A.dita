That is, the entity&#x2019;s business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling financial assets or both. Consequently, this assessment is not performed on the basis of scenarios that the entity does not reasonably expect to occur, such as so-called &#x2018;worst case&#x2019; or &#x2018;stress case&#x2019; scenarios. For example, if an entity expects that it will sell a particular portfolio of financial assets only in a stress case scenario, that scenario would not affect the entity&#x2019;s assessment of the business model for those assets if the entity reasonably expects that such a scenario will not occur. If cash flows are realised in a way that is different from the entity&#x2019;s expectations at the date that the entity assessed the business model (for&#xa0;example, if the entity sells more or fewer financial assets than it expected when it classified the assets), that does not give rise to a prior period error in the entity&#x2019;s financial statements (see <xref base="F43475171" href="../ias08/IAS08_TOC.dita#IAS08_TOC0001" id="IFRS09_X1173">IAS&#xa0;8 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors</ph></ph></xref>) nor does it change the classification of the remaining financial assets held in that business model (ie&#xa0;those assets that the entity recognised in prior periods and still holds) as long as the entity considered all relevant information that was available at the time that it made the business model assessment. However, when an entity assesses the business model for newly originated or newly purchased financial assets, it must consider information about how cash flows were realised in the past, along with all other relevant information.</p></body></paragraph>
