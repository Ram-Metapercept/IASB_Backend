For example, an entity plans to enforce the collateral on a financial asset and expects to recover no more than 30&#xa0;per&#xa0;cent of the financial asset from the collateral. If the entity has no reasonable prospects of recovering any further cash flows from the financial asset, it should write off the remaining 70&#xa0;per&#xa0;cent of the financial asset.</p></body></paragraph>
