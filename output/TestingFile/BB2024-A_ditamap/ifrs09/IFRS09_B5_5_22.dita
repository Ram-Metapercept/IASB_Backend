Financial instruments are not considered to have low credit risk when they are regarded as having a low risk of loss simply because of the value of collateral and the financial instrument without that collateral would not be considered low credit risk. Financial instruments are also not considered to have low credit risk simply because they have a lower risk of default than the entity&#x2019;s other financial instruments or relative to the credit risk of the jurisdiction within which an entity operates.</p></body></paragraph>
