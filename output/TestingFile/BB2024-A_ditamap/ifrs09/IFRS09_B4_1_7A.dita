In a basic lending arrangement, consideration for the time value of money (see <xref id="IFRS09_X1193" base="F41907804" href="IFRS09_gB4_1_9A-B4_1_9E.dita#IFRS09_gB4_1_9A-B4_1_9E/IFRS09_gB4_1_9A-B4_1_9E_TI">paragraphs&#xa0;B4.1.9A&#x2013;B4.1.9E</xref>) and credit risk are typically the most significant elements of interest. However, in such an arrangement, interest can also include consideration for other basic lending risks (for example, liquidity risk) and costs (for example, administrative costs) associated with holding the financial asset for a particular period of time. In addition, interest can include a profit margin that is consistent with a basic lending arrangement. In extreme economic circumstances, interest can be negative if, for example, the holder of a financial asset either explicitly or implicitly pays for the deposit of its money for a particular period of time (and that fee exceeds the consideration that the holder receives for the time value of money, credit risk and other basic lending risks and costs). However, contractual terms that introduce exposure to risks or volatility in the contractual cash flows that is unrelated to a basic lending arrangement, such as exposure to changes in equity prices or commodity prices, do not give rise to contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. An originated or a purchased financial asset can be a basic lending arrangement irrespective of whether it is a loan in its legal form.</p></body></paragraph>
