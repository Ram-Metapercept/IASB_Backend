For example, if a financial services firm decides on 15&#xa0;February to shut down its retail mortgage business and hence must reclassify all affected financial assets on 1&#xa0;April (ie&#xa0;the first day of the entity&#x2019;s next reporting period), the entity must not accept new retail mortgage business or otherwise engage in activities consistent with its former business model after 15&#xa0;February.</p></body></paragraph>
