The entity invests its excess cash in short and long-term financial assets so that it can fund the expenditure when the need arises. Many of the financial assets have contractual lives that exceed the entity’s anticipated investment period.</p>               <p base="F32571481" id="IFRS09_P1044">The entity will hold financial assets to collect the contractual cash flows and, when an opportunity arises, it will sell financial assets to re‑invest the cash in financial assets with a higher return.</p>               <p base="F32571483" id="IFRS09_P1045">The managers responsible for the portfolio are remunerated based on the overall return generated by the portfolio.</p>             </entry><entry align="left" colname="C2" valign="top">               <p base="F32571484" id="IFRS09_P1046">The objective of the business model is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.

When the investments mature, the entity reinvests the cash in new short-term financial assets. The entity maintains this strategy until the funds are needed, at which time the entity uses the proceeds from the maturing financial assets to fund the capital expenditure. Only sales that are insignificant in value occur before maturity (unless there is an increase in credit risk). The objective of this contrasting business model is to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows.</p>             </entry></row><row><entry align="left" colname="C1" valign="top">               <p typeface="sansserif" base="F32571488" id="IFRS09_P1048"><b>Example 6</b></p>               <p base="F32571491" id="IFRS09_P1049">A financial institution holds financial assets to meet its everyday liquidity needs. The entity seeks to minimise the costs of managing those liquidity needs and therefore actively manages the return on the portfolio. That return consists of collecting contractual payments as well as gains and losses from the sale of financial assets.</p>               <p base="F32571492" id="IFRS09_P1050">As a result, the entity holds financial assets to collect contractual cash flows and sells financial assets to reinvest in higher yielding financial assets or to better match the duration of its liabilities. In the past, this strategy has resulted in frequent sales activity and such sales have been significant in value. This activity is expected to continue in the future.</p>             </entry><entry align="left" colname="C2" valign="top">               <p base="F32571493" id="IFRS09_P1051">The objective of the business model is to maximise the return on the portfolio to meet everyday liquidity needs and the entity achieves that objective by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.

The insurer uses the proceeds from the contractual cash flows on the financial assets to settle insurance contract liabilities as they come due. To ensure that the contractual cash flows from the financial assets are sufficient to settle those liabilities, the insurer undertakes significant buying and selling activity on a regular basis to rebalance its portfolio of assets and to meet cash flow needs as they arise.</p>             </entry><entry align="left" colname="C2" valign="top">               <p base="F32571498" id="IFRS09_P1054">The objective of the business model is to fund the insurance contract liabilities.
