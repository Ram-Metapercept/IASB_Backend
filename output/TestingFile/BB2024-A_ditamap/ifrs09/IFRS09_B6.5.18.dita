The measurement of the changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument related to the volume that continues to be designated also remains unaffected. However, from the date of rebalancing, the volume by which the hedging instrument was decreased is no longer part of the hedging relationship. For example, if an entity originally hedged the price risk of a commodity using a derivative volume of 100 tonnes as the hedging instrument and reduces that volume by 10 tonnes on rebalancing, a nominal amount of 90 tonnes of the hedging instrument volume would remain (see <xref href="IFRS09_B6.5.16.dita" scope="local" id="IFRS09_X1595">paragraph B6.5.16</xref> for the consequences for the derivative volume (ie the 10 tonnes) that is no longer a part of the hedging relationship).</p></body></paragraph>
