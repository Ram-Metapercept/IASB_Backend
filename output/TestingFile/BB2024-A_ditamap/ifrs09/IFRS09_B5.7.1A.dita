This measurement category recognises information in profit or loss as if the financial asset is measured at amortised cost, while the financial asset is measured in the statement of financial position at fair value. Gains or losses, other than those that are recognised in profit or loss in accordance with <xref id="IFRS09_X1472" base="F70532759" href="IFRS09_g5.7.10-5.7.11.dita#IFRS09_g5.7.10-5.7.11/IFRS09_g5.7.10-5.7.11_TI">paragraphs 5.7.10–5.7.11</xref>, are recognised in other comprehensive income. When these financial assets are derecognised, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss. This reflects the gain or loss that would have been recognised in profit or loss upon derecognition if the financial asset had been measured at amortised cost.</p></body></paragraph>
