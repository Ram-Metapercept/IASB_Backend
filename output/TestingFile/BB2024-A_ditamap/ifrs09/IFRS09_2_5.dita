This designation is available only at inception of the contract and only if it eliminates or significantly reduces a recognition inconsistency (sometimes referred to as an &#x2018;accounting mismatch&#x2019;) that would otherwise arise from not recognising that contract because it is excluded from the scope of this Standard (see <xref id="IFRS09_X0212" base="F68104406" href="IFRS09_2_4.dita#IFRS09_2_4">paragraph&#xa0;2.4</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
