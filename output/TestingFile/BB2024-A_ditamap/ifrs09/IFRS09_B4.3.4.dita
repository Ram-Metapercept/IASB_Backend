However, embedded derivatives that are classified as equity (see <xref base="F69953862" href="../ias32/IAS32_TOC.dita#IAS32_TOC0001/IAS32_TOC0001_V2" id="IFRS09_X1290">IAS 32 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Financial Instruments: Presentation</ph></ph></xref>) are accounted for separately from those classified as assets or liabilities. In addition, if a hybrid contract has more than one embedded derivative and those derivatives relate to different risk exposures and are readily separable and independent of each other, they are accounted for separately from each other.</p></body></paragraph>
