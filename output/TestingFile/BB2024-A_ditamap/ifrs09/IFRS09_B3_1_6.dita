Settlement date accounting refers to&#xa0;(a) the recognition of an asset on the day it is received by the entity, and&#xa0;(b) the derecognition of an asset and recognition of any gain or loss on disposal on the day that it is delivered by the entity. When settlement date accounting is applied an entity accounts for any change in the fair value of the asset to be received during the period between the trade date and the settlement date in the same way as it accounts for the acquired asset. In other words, the change in value is not recognised for assets measured at amortised cost; it is recognised in profit or loss for assets classified as financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss; and it is recognised in other comprehensive income for financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income in accordance with <xref base="F41907205" href="IFRS09_4_1_2A.dita#IFRS09_4_1_2A" id="IFRS09_X1075">paragraph&#xa0;4.1.2A</xref> and for investments in equity instruments accounted for in accordance with <xref base="F41907208" href="IFRS09_g5_7_5-5_7_6.dita#IFRS09_g5_7_5-5_7_6/IFRS09_g5_7_5-5_7_6_TI" id="IFRS09_X1076">paragraph&#xa0;5.7.5</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
