However, there is a rebuttable presumption that default does not occur later than when a financial asset is 90&#xa0;days past due unless an entity has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more lagging default criterion is more appropriate. The definition of default used for these purposes shall be applied consistently to all financial instruments unless information becomes available that demonstrates that another default definition is more appropriate for a particular financial instrument.</p></body></paragraph>
