A change in an accounting estimate may affect       only the current period’s profit or loss, or the profit or loss of both the current       period and future periods. For example, a change in a loss allowance for expected credit       losses affects only the current period’s profit or loss and therefore is recognised       in the current period. However, a change in the estimated useful life of, or the expected       pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in, a depreciable asset       affects depreciation expense for the current period and for each future period during the       asset’s remaining useful life. In both cases, the effect of the change relating to       the current period is recognised as income or expense in the current period. The effect, if       any, on future periods is recognised as income or expense in those future periods.</p>   </bodydiv></body></paragraph>
