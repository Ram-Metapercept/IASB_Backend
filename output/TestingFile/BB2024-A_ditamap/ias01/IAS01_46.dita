An entity changes the presentation of its financial statements only if the changed presentation provides information that is reliable&#xa0;and more relevant                     to users                     of the financial statements and the revised structure is likely to continue, so that comparability                     is not impaired. When making such changes in presentation, an entity reclassifies its comparative information              in accordance with paragraphs 41 and 42.</p></body></paragraph>
