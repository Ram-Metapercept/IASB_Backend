The final stage in the process of aggregation and classification is the presentation of condensed and classified data, which form line items in the financial statements. If a line item is not individually&#xa0;material, it is aggregated with other items either in those statements or in the&#xa0;notes. An item that is not sufficiently material to warrant separate presentation in those statements may warrant separate presentation in the notes.</p></body></paragraph>
