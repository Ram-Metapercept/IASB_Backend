Except for changes resulting from transactions with&#xa0;owners&#xa0;in their capacity as owners (such as equity contributions, reacquisitions of the entity&#x2019;s own equity instruments and dividends) and transaction costs directly related to such transactions, the overall change in equity during a period represents the total amount of income and expense, including gains and losses, generated by the entity&#x2019;s activities during that period.</p></body></paragraph>
