An entity shall prepare financial statements on a going concern basis unless management either       intends to liquidate the entity or to cease trading, or has no realistic alternative but to do         so.       When management is aware, in making its assessment, of material uncertainties related to events or conditions       that may cast significant doubt upon the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, the       entity shall disclose those uncertainties. When an entity       does not prepare financial statements on a going concern basis, it shall disclose that fact,       together with the basis on which it prepared the financial statements and the reason why the       entity is not regarded as a going concern.</p></body></paragraph>
