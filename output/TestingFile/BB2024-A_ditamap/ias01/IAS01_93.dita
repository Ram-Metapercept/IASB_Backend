Such reclassifications are referred to in this Standard as&#xa0;reclassification adjustments. A reclassification adjustment is included with the related component of other comprehensive income in the period that the adjustment is reclassified to profit or loss. These amounts may have been recognised in other comprehensive income as unrealised gains in the current or previous periods. Those unrealised gains must be deducted from other comprehensive income in the period in which the realised gains are reclassified to profit or loss to avoid including them in&#xa0;total comprehensive income&#xa0;twice.</p>     </variant></body></paragraph>
