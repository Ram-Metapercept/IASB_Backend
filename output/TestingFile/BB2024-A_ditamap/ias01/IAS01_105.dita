Both methods provide an indication of those costs that might vary, directly or indirectly, with the level of sales or production of the entity. Because each method of presentation has merit for different types of entities, this Standard requires management to select the presentation that is reliable and more relevant.                     However, because information on the nature of expenses is useful in predicting future cash flows, additional disclosure is required when the function of expense classification is used.
