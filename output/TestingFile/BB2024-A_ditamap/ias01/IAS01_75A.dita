If a liability meets the criteria in paragraph 69 for classification as       non-current, it is classified as non-current even if management intends or expects the entity       to settle the liability within twelve months after the reporting period, or even if the entity       settles the liability between the end of the reporting period and the date the financial statements are authorised for issue. However, in either of       those circumstances, the entity may need to disclose information about the timing of       settlement to enable users of its financial           statements to       understand the impact of the liability on the entity’s financial position (see <xref href="IAS01_17.dita">paragraphs 17(c)</xref> and <xref href="IAS01_76.dita">76(d)</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
