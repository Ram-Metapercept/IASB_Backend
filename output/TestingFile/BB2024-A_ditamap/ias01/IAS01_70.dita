An entity classifies such operating items as current liabilities even if they are due to be settled more than twelve months after the reporting period. The same normal operating cycle applies to the classification of an entity&#x2019;s assets and liabilities. When the entity&#x2019;s normal operating cycle is not clearly identifiable, it is assumed to be twelve months.</p></body></paragraph>
