The Committee           observed that calculations using a DDM which values shares at the discounted value of           future dividend payments, may be appropriate when calculating value in use of a single           asset, for example when an entity applies IAS&#xa0;36 in determining whether an investment is           impaired in the separate financial statements of an entity. The Committee understands that           some DDMs may focus on future cash flows that are expected to be available for           distribution to shareholders, rather than future cash flows from dividends. Such a DDM           could be used to calculate value in use of a CGU in consolidated financial statements, if           it is consistent with the principles and requirements in IAS&#xa0;36.</p>         <p>The Committee noted that the current principles in IAS&#xa0;36 relating to the calculation of           value in use of a CGU are sufficient and that any guidance that it could provide would be           in the nature of application guidance.

This paragraph sets out the requirements for           considering recognised liabilities in determining the recoverable amount of a           cash-generating unit (CGU) within the context of an impairment test for a CGU.</p>         <p>The submitter questioned the approach set out in paragraph&#xa0;78 of IAS&#xa0;36, which requires           an entity to deduct the carrying amount of any recognised liabilities in determining both           the CGU&#x2019;s carrying amount and its value in use (VIU). The submitter asked whether an           alternative approach should be required.</p>         <p>The Interpretations Committee observed that when an entity needs to consider a recognised           liability to determine the recoverable amount of a CGU (which may occur if the disposal of           a CGU would require the buyer to assume the liability), paragraph&#xa0;78 of IAS&#xa0;36 requires           the entity to deduct the carrying amount of the recognised liability in determining both           the CGU&#x2019;s carrying amount and its VIU. This approach of determining both the CGU&#x2019;s           carrying amount and its VIU by deducting the same carrying amount of the recognised           liability makes the comparison between the CGU&#x2019;s carrying amount and the CGU&#x2019;s recoverable           amount meaningful.</p>         <p>The Interpretations Committee observed that the approach in paragraph&#xa0;78 of IAS&#xa0;36 for           considering recognised liabilities provides a straightforward and cost-effective method to           perform a meaningful comparison of the measures involved in an impairment test for a           CGU.</p>         <p>In the light of the existing requirements in IFRS Standards, the Interpretations           Committee determined that neither an Interpretation nor an amendment to a Standard was           necessary.

The consequential amendment replaced the reference to &#x2018;segments&#x2019; (as determined in           accordance with IAS 14&#xa0;<i>Reporting Segments</i>) to &#x2018;operating segments&#x2019; (as determined           in accordance with IFRS&#xa0;8). In particular, paragraph 80(b) of IAS&#xa0;36 was amended to refer           to IFRS&#xa0;8 when setting the limit for the aggregation of cash&#x2011;generating units when testing           for goodwill impairment. Previously, the limit had been set by reference to segments           identified by IAS&#xa0;14. The IFRIC noted that when entities test goodwill for impairment in           the first year of adoption of IFRS&#xa0;8 some entities may need to recognise an impairment           loss for goodwill, at least in part because of these changes in the segment           definitions.&#xa0;</p>         <p>The question asked of the IFRIC was whether any incremental goodwill impairment loss           (that would have been recognised in a prior period if cash&#x2011;generating units had been           grouped by reference to IFRS&#xa0;8) determined as a result of retrospective application of the           change from IAS&#xa0;14 to IFRS&#xa0;8 should be presented as a prior period adjustment or a current           period event.&#xa0;</p>         <p>The IFRIC noted that IFRS 8 was effective for annual periods beginning on or after           1&#xa0;January 2009 and therefore applicable for entities with annual periods ending           31&#xa0;December 2009 and thereafter. Because of the required due process procedures included           in the IFRIC&#xa0;<i>Due Process Handbook</i>, it would not be able to provide guidance on a           timely basis. Therefore, the IFRIC decided not to add the issue to its agenda.]</p>       </fn><fn base="IAS36_A12" id="IAS36_FN0010">                  <p id="IAS36_P5326">[The term &#x2018;faithful representation&#x2019;, which was           used in the&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual               Framework</ph></ph>&#xa0;issued in 2010 and is also used in the revised version of the&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual             Framework</ph></ph>&#xa0;issued in 2018, encompasses the main characteristics that the&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph>&#xa0;called           &#x2018;reliability&#x2019; (refer&#xa0;<xref href="../cf2018/CF2018_g2_12-2_19.dita" scope="local"><ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual               Framework</ph></ph>&#xa0;paragraphs 2.12&#x2013;2.19</xref>&#xa0;and&#xa0;<xref href="../cf2018/CF2018_gBC2_21-BC2_51.dita" scope="local">Basis for Conclusions             paragraphs BC2.21&#x2013;BC2.31</xref>).]</p>       </fn></bodydiv></body></topic>
