An&#xa0;asset is carried at more than its recoverable amount if its carrying amount exceeds the amount to be recovered through use or sale of the asset. If this is the case, the asset is described as impaired and the Standard requires the entity to recognise an impairment loss. The&#xa0;Standard also specifies when an entity should reverse an impairment loss and prescribes disclosures.</p></body></paragraph>
