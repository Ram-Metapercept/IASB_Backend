As a consequence, if there is an indication that a corporate asset may be impaired, recoverable amount is determined for the cash‑generating unit or group of cash‑generating units to which the corporate asset belongs, and is compared with the carrying amount of this cash‑generating unit or group of cash‑generating units. Any impairment loss is recognised in accordance with <xref id="IAS36_X0303" base="A36-244" href="IAS36_104.dita#IAS36_104">paragraph 104</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
