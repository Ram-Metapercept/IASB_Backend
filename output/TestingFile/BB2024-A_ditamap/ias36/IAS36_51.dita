Otherwise, the effect of some assumptions will be counted twice or ignored. Because the time value of money is considered by discounting the estimated future cash flows, these cash flows exclude cash inflows or outflows from financing activities. Similarly, because the discount rate is determined on a pre‑tax basis, future cash flows are also estimated on a pre‑tax basis.</p></body></paragraph>
