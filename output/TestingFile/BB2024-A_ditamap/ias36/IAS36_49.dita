When a cash&#x2011;generating unit consists of assets with different estimated useful lives, all of which are essential to the ongoing operation of the unit, the replacement of assets with shorter lives is considered to be part of the day&#x2011;to&#x2011;day servicing of the unit when estimating the future cash flows associated with the unit. Similarly, when a single asset consists of components with different estimated useful lives, the replacement of components with shorter lives is considered to be part of the day&#x2011;to&#x2011;day servicing of the asset when estimating the future cash flows generated by the asset.</p></body></paragraph>
