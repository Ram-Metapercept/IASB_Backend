Under the ‘traditional’ approach, adjustments for factors (b)–(e) described in <xref id="IAS36_X0442" base="A36-269" href="IAS36_A1.dita#IAS36_A1">paragraph A1</xref> are embedded in the discount rate. Under the ‘expected cash flow’ approach, factors (b), (d) and (e) cause adjustments in arriving at risk‑adjusted expected cash flows. Whichever approach an entity adopts to reflect expectations about possible variations in the amount or timing of future cash flows, the result should be to reflect the expected present value of the future cash flows, ie the weighted average of all possible outcomes.</p></body></paragraph>
