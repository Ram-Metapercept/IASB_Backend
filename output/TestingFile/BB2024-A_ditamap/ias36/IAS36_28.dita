Examples of such costs are legal costs, stamp duty and similar transaction taxes, costs of removing the asset, and direct incremental costs to bring an asset into condition for its sale. However, termination benefits (as&#xa0;defined in <xref id="IAS36_X0225" base="F16454411" href="../ias19/IAS19_TOC0001.dita#IAS19_TOC0001">IAS&#xa0;19</xref>) and costs associated with reducing or reorganising a business following the disposal of an asset are not direct incremental costs to dispose of the asset.</p></body></paragraph>
