Otherwise, the cash&#x2011;generating unit may appear to be fully recoverable when in fact an impairment loss has occurred. In some cases, although some assets contribute to the estimated future cash flows of a cash&#x2011;generating unit, they cannot be allocated to the cash&#x2011;generating unit on a reasonable and consistent basis. This might be the case for goodwill or corporate assets such as head office assets. <xref id="IAS36_X0278" base="SL195782" href="IAS36_80.dita#IAS36_80">Paragraphs 80&#x2013;103</xref> explain how to deal with these assets in testing a cash&#x2011;generating unit for impairment.</p></body></paragraph>
