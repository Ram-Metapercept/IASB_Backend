The&#xa0;structure of an entity determines whether an asset meets this Standard&#x2019;s definition of corporate assets for a particular cash&#x2011;generating unit. The distinctive characteristics of corporate assets are that they do not generate cash inflows independently of other assets or groups of assets and their carrying amount cannot be fully attributed to the cash&#x2011;generating unit under review.</p></body></paragraph>
