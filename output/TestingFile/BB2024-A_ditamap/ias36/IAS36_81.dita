Goodwill does not generate cash flows independently of other assets or groups of assets, and often contributes to the cash flows of multiple cash&#x2011;generating units. Goodwill sometimes cannot be allocated on a non&#x2011;arbitrary basis to individual cash&#x2011;generating units, but only to groups of cash&#x2011;generating units. As&#xa0;a result, the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes sometimes comprises a number of cash&#x2011;generating units to which the goodwill relates, but to which it cannot be allocated.
