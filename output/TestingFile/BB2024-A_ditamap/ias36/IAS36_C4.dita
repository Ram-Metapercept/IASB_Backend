As a consequence, an entity shall gross up the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the unit to include the goodwill attributable to the non&#x2011;controlling interest. This adjusted carrying amount is then compared with the recoverable amount of the unit to determine whether the cash&#x2011;generating unit is impaired.</p></body></paragraph>
