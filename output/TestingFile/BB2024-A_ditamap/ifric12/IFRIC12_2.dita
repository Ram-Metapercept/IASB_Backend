The infrastructure may already exist, or may be constructed during the period of the service arrangement. An arrangement within the scope of this Interpretation typically involves a private sector entity (an operator) constructing the infrastructure used to provide the public service or upgrading it (for example, by increasing its capacity) and operating and maintaining that infrastructure for a specified period of time. The operator is paid for its services over the period of the arrangement. The arrangement is governed by a contract that sets out performance standards, mechanisms for adjusting prices, and arrangements for arbitrating disputes. Such an arrangement is often described as a &#x2018;build&#x2011;operate&#x2011;transfer&#x2019;, a &#x2018;rehabilitate&#x2011;operate&#x2011;transfer&#x2019; or a &#x2018;public&#x2011;to&#x2011;private&#x2019; service concession arrangement.</p></body></paragraph>
