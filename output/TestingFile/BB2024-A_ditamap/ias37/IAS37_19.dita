Examples of such       obligations are penalties or clean‑up costs for unlawful environmental damage, both of       which would lead to an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits in settlement       regardless of the future actions of the entity. Similarly, an entity recognises a provision       for the decommissioning costs of an oil installation or a nuclear power station to the extent       that the entity is obliged to rectify damage already caused. In contrast, because of       commercial pressures or legal requirements, an entity may intend or need to carry out       expenditure to operate in a particular way in the future (for example, by fitting smoke       filters in a certain type of factory). Because the entity can avoid the future expenditure by       its future actions, for example by changing its method of operation, it has no present       obligation        for that future expenditure and no provision is recognised.</p></body></paragraph>
