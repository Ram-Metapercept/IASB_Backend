It&#xa0;is&#xa0;not necessary, however, to know the identity of the party to whom the obligation is owed&#x2014;indeed the obligation may be to the public at large. Because an obligation always involves a commitment to another party, it follows that a management or board decision does not give rise to a constructive obligation at the end of the reporting period unless the decision has been communicated before the end of the reporting period to those affected by it in a sufficiently specific manner to raise a valid expectation in them that the entity will discharge its responsibilities.</p></body></paragraph>
