Until there is a binding sale agreement, the entity will be able to change its mind and indeed will have to take another course of action if a purchaser cannot be found on acceptable terms. When the sale of an operation is envisaged as part of a restructuring, the assets of the operation are reviewed for impairment, under <xref id="IAS37_X0193" base="F16456131" href="../ias36/IAS36_TOC0001.dita#IAS36_TOC0001">IAS 36</xref>. When a sale is only part of a restructuring, a constructive obligation can arise for the other parts of the restructuring before a binding sale agreement exists.</p></body></paragraph>
