However, within this Standard the term &#x2018;contingent&#x2019; is used for liabilities and assets that are not recognised because their existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non&#x2011;occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity. In addition, the term &#x2018;contingent liability&#x2019; is used for liabilities that do not meet the recognition criteria.</p></body></paragraph>
