This is especially true in the case of provisions, which by their nature are more uncertain than most other items in the statement of financial position.              Except in extremely rare cases, an entity will be able to determine a range of possible outcomes and can therefore make an estimate of the obligation that is sufficiently reliable to use in recognising a provision.</p></body></paragraph>
