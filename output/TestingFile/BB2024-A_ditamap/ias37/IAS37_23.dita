For the purpose of this Standard,<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS37_FN0006" type="fn"/> an outflow of resources or other event is regarded as probable if the event is more likely than not to occur, ie&#xa0;the probability that the event will occur is greater than the probability that it will not. Where it is not probable that a present obligation exists, an entity discloses a contingent liability, unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote (see <xref id="IAS37_X0151" base="A37-144" href="IAS37_86.dita#IAS37_86">paragraph 86</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
