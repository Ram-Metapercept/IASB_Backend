Fair value reflects the amount for which the same inventory could be exchanged between knowledgeable and willing buyers and sellers in the marketplace. The former is an entity specific value; the latter is not. Net realisable value for inventories may not equal fair value less costs to sell.</p></glossdef><related-links><linklist id="GLOSSARY_P0799"><link base="F1475810" href="../ias02/IAS02_6.dita#IAS02_6/IAS02_P0026" id="GLOSSARY_X0428"><linktext>IAS 2.6–7</linktext></link></linklist></related-links></glossentry>
