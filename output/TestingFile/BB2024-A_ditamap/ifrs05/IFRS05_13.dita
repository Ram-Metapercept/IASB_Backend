This is because its carrying amount will be recovered principally through continuing use. However, if the disposal group to be abandoned meets the criteria in <xref id="IFRS05_X0134" base="F4-78" href="IFRS05_32.dita#IFRS05_32">paragraph 32(a)&#x2013;(c)</xref>, the entity shall present the results and cash flows of the disposal group as discontinued operations in accordance with <xref id="IFRS05_X0135" base="F1150151" href="IFRS05_33.dita#IFRS05_33">paragraphs 33 and 34</xref> at the date on which it ceases to be used. Non&#x2011;current assets (or disposal groups) to be abandoned include non&#x2011;current assets (or disposal groups) that are to be used to the end of their economic life and non&#x2011;current assets (or disposal groups) that are to be closed rather than sold.</p></body></paragraph>
