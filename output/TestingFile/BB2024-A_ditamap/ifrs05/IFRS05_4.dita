Such a disposal group may be a group of <i>cash‑generating units</i>, a single cash‑generating unit, or part of a cash‑generating unit.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS05_FN0003" type="fn"/> The group may include any assets and any liabilities of the entity, including current assets, current liabilities              and assets excluded by <xref href="IFRS05_5.dita" scope="local" id="IFRS05_X0073">paragraph 5</xref> from the measurement requirements              of this IFRS. If a non‑current asset within the scope of the measurement requirements of this IFRS is part of a disposal group, the measurement requirements of this IFRS apply to the group as a whole, so that the group is measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The requirements for measuring the individual assets and liabilities within the disposal group are set out in <xref href="IFRS05_18.dita" scope="local" id="IFRS05_X0075">paragraphs 18</xref>, <xref href="IFRS05_19.dita" scope="local">19</xref> and <xref base="F1150149" href="IFRS05_23.dita#IFRS05_23" id="IFRS05_X0076">23</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
