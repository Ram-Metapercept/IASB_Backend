In this assessment, a reporting entity would consider both quantitative considerations (ie the size of the subsidiary) and qualitative considerations (ie the nature of the subsidiary).</p>       <p>The Interpretations Committee noted that the decision on which approach is used to present the disclosures required by paragraphs 12(e)&#x2013;(g) should reflect the one that best meets the disclosure objective of paragraph&#xa0;10 of IFRS&#xa0;12 in the circumstances. According to this objective, &#x2018;An entity shall disclose information that enables users of its consolidated financial statements to understand (i) the composition of the group; and (ii) the interest that non-controlling interests have in the group&#x2019;s activities and cash flows&#x2019;.</p>       <p>The Interpretations Committee observed that this judgement would be made separately for each subsidiary or subgroup that has a material non-controlling interest.</p>       <p outputclass="keep_with_next" id="IFRS12_P0615"><i>Disclosures required by paragraphs&#xa0;12(e) and (f) of IFRS&#xa0;12</i></p>       <p id="IFRS12_P0616">The Interpretations Committee observed that a reporting entity would meet the requirements in paragraphs&#xa0;12(e) and (f) by disclosing disaggregated information from the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements of the reporting entity in respect of subsidiaries that have non-controlling interests that are material to the reporting entity. The Interpretations Committee further observed that a reporting entity should apply judgement in determining the level of disaggregation of this information; that is, whether:</p>       <ol outputclass="static" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>           <p id="IFRS12_P0617">the entity presents this information about the subgroup of the subsidiary that has a material non-controlling interest (present the required information on the basis of the subsidiary together with its investees); or</p>         </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>           <p id="IFRS12_P0618">it is necessary in achieving the disclosure objective in paragraph&#xa0;10 of IFRS&#xa0;12 to disaggregate the information further to present information about individual subsidiaries that have material non-controlling interests within that subgroup.</p>         </li></ol>       <p outputclass="keep_with_next" id="IFRS12_P0619"><i>Disclosures required by paragraph&#xa0;12(g) of IFRS&#xa0;12</i></p>       <p outputclass="keep_with_next" id="IFRS12_P0620">The Interpretations Committee observed that:</p>       <ol outputclass="static" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>           <p id="IFRS12_P0621">paragraph&#xa0;12(g) requires summarised information about the subsidiaries that have non-controlling interests that are material to the reporting entity;</p>         </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>           <p id="IFRS12_P0622">paragraph&#xa0;B10(b) states that an entity shall disclose &#x2018;summarised financial information about the assets, liabilities, profit or loss and cash flows of the subsidiary that enables users to understand the interest that non-controlling interests have in the group&#x2019;s activities and cash flows.

The Interpretations Committee understood this to mean that the information would be prepared from the perspective of the reporting entity. For example, if the subsidiary was acquired in a business combination, the amounts disclosed should reflect the effects of the acquisition accounting.</p>       <p outputclass="keep_with_next">The Interpretations Committee further observed that in providing the information required by paragraph&#xa0;12(g) the entity would apply judgement in determining whether:</p>       <ol outputclass="static" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>           <p id="IFRS12_P0625">the entity presents this information about the subgroup of the subsidiary that has a material non-controlling interest (ie, it presents the required information on the basis of the subsidiary together with its investees); or</p>         </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>           <p id="IFRS12_P0626">it is necessary in achieving the disclosure objective in paragraph&#xa0;10 of IFRS&#xa0;12 to disaggregate the information further to present information about individual subsidiaries that have material non-controlling interests within that subgroup.</p>         </li></ol>       <p id="IFRS12_P0627">However, the Interpretations Committee noted that the information provided in respect of paragraph&#xa0;12(g) would include transactions between the subgroup/subsidiary and other members of the reporting entity&#x2019;s group without elimination in order to meet the requirements in paragraph&#xa0;B11 of IFRS&#xa0;12. The transactions within the subgroup would be eliminated.</p>       <p id="IFRS12_P0628">On the basis of this analysis, the Interpretations Committee determined that, in the light of the existing IFRS requirements, sufficient guidance exists and that neither an Interpretation nor an amendment to a Standard was necessary.

Either the information required in paragraph&#xa0;21(b)(ii) of IFRS&#xa0;12 can be disclosed in aggregate for all material joint ventures or associates, or such information should be disclosed individually for each material joint venture or associate.</p>       <p>The submitter also asked the Interpretations Committee to clarify the requirements in paragraph&#xa0;21(b)(ii) of IFRS&#xa0;12 when the information relates to a listed joint venture or associate, and local regulatory requirements would prevent the investor from disclosing such information until the joint venture or associate has released its own financial statements. Would the investor be excused from disclosing the information?</p>       <p>The Interpretations Committee noted that it expected the requirement in paragraph&#xa0;21(b)(ii) of IFRS&#xa0;12 to lead to the disclosure of summarised information on an individual basis for each joint venture or associate that is material to the reporting entity (ie this information should not be presented in aggregate for all material joint ventures or associates). The Interpretations Committee observed that this reflects the IASB&apos;s intentions as described in paragraph&#xa0;BC50 of IFRS&#xa0;12.</p>       <p>The Interpretations Committee also noted that there is no provision in IFRS&#xa0;12 that permits the non-disclosure of the information required in paragraph&#xa0;21(b)(ii) of IFRS&#xa0;12.</p>       <p>The Interpretations Committee was made aware of another concern relating to the disclosures required by IFRS&#xa0;12 for joint ventures or associates in paragraphs&#xa0;21(b)(ii), and paragraphs&#xa0;B12 and B13. Some think that these paragraphs do not specify the basis on which an entity should prepare the required summarised financial information for joint ventures and associates. The question raised is whether this information should be presented for each material joint venture or associate on an individual basis, or whether this information should be disclosed for the subgroup of the joint venture or associate together with its investees.</p>       <p>The Interpretations Committee observed that a reporting entity should present the summarised financial information required by paragraph&#xa0;21(b)(ii) about a joint venture or an associate that is material to the reporting entity based on the consolidated financial statements for the joint venture or associate, if it has subsidiaries. If it does not have subsidiaries, the presentation should be based on the financial statements of the joint venture or associate in which its own joint ventures or associates are equity-accounted. The Interpretations Committee noted that these views are consistent with paragraph&#xa0;B14(a), which states that &#x2018;the amounts included in the IFRS financial statements of the joint venture or associate shall be adjusted to reflect adjustments made by the entity using the equity method, such as fair value adjustments made at the time of acquisition and adjustments for differences in accounting policies&#x2019;.</p>       <p outputclass="keep_with_next">The Interpretations Committee analysed the results of the outreach request performed by the staff. This outreach indicated that no significant diversity has been observed in the application of IFRS&#xa0;12 related to these issues.</p>       <p>In the light of the existing IFRS requirements, and on the basis of the outreach results received, the Interpretations Committee determined that neither an Interpretation nor an amendment to a Standard was necessary and therefore decided not to add this issue to its agenda.]</p>       </fn></bodydiv></body></topic>
