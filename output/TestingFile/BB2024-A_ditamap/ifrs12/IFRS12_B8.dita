For example, assume a structured entity holds a loan portfolio. The structured entity obtains a credit default swap from another entity (the reporting entity) to protect itself from the default of interest and principal payments on the loans. The reporting entity has involvement that exposes it to variability of returns from the performance of the structured entity because the credit default swap absorbs variability of returns of the structured entity.</p></body></paragraph>
