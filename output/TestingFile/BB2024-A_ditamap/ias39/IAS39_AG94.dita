In other words, a written option is not effective in reducing the profit or loss exposure of a hedged item. Therefore, a written option does not qualify as a&#xa0;hedging instrument&#xa0;unless it is designated as an offset to a purchased option, including one that is embedded in another&#xa0;financial instrument&#xa0;(for example, a written call option used to hedge a callable liability). In contrast, a purchased option has potential gains equal to or greater than losses and therefore has the potential to reduce profit or loss exposure from changes in fair values or cash flows. Accordingly, it can qualify as a hedging instrument.</p></body></paragraph>
