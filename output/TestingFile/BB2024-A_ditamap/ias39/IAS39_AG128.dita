When       this occurs, the amount of change in fair value included in the       separate line item referred to in <xref base="F16151813" href="IAS39_AG114.dita#IAS39_AG114" id="IAS39_X1055">paragraph AG114(g)</xref> that relates to the derecognised item shall be       removed from the statement of financial position, and included in the gain or loss that arises       on derecognition of the item. For this purpose, it is necessary to know the repricing time       period(s) into which the derecognised item was scheduled, because this determines the       repricing time period(s) from which to remove it and hence the amount to remove from the       separate line item referred to in <xref base="F16151814" href="IAS39_AG114.dita#IAS39_AG114" id="IAS39_X1056">paragraph AG114(g)</xref>. When an item is derecognised, if it can be       determined in which time period it was included, it is removed from that time period. If not,       it is removed from the earliest time period if the derecognition resulted from higher than       expected prepayments, or allocated to all time periods containing the derecognised item on a       systematic and rational basis if the item was sold or became impaired.</p></body></paragraph>
