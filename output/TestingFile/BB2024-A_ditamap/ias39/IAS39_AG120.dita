Such a portfolio of derivatives may contain offsetting risk positions. However, it may not include written options or net written options, because the Standard<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS39_FN0043" type="fn"/> does not permit such options to be designated as hedging instruments (except when a written option is designated as an offset to a purchased option). If the hedging instrument hedges the amount designated in <xref base="F16151454" href="IAS39_AG114.dita#IAS39_AG114" id="IAS39_X1038">paragraph AG114(c)</xref> for more than one repricing time period, it is allocated to all of the time periods that it hedges. However, the whole of the hedging instrument must be allocated to those repricing time periods because the Standard<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS39_FN0044" type="fn"/> does not permit a hedging relationship to be designated for only a portion of the time period during which a hedging instrument remains outstanding.</p></body></paragraph>
