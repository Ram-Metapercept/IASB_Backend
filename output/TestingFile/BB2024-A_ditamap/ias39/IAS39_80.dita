It follows that hedge accounting can be applied to transactions between entities in the same group only in the individual or separate financial statements of those entities and not in the consolidated financial statements of the group, except for the consolidated financial statements of an investment entity, as defined in <xref base="F24731021" href="../ifrs10/IFRS10_TOC.dita#IFRS10_TOC0001" id="IAS39_X0464">IFRS 10</xref>, where transactions between an investment entity and its subsidiaries measured at fair value through profit or loss will not be eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. As an exception, the foreign currency risk of an intragroup monetary item (eg a payable/receivable between two subsidiaries) may qualify as a hedged item in the consolidated financial statements if it results in an exposure to foreign exchange rate gains or losses that are not fully eliminated on consolidation in accordance with <xref base="F21342034" href="../ias21/IAS21_TOC.dita" scope="local" id="IAS39_X0465">IAS 21 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates</ph></ph></xref>. In accordance with IAS 21, foreign exchange rate gains and losses on intragroup monetary items are not fully eliminated on consolidation when the intragroup monetary item is transacted between two group entities that have different functional currencies. In addition, the foreign currency risk of a highly probable forecast intragroup transaction may qualify as a hedged item in consolidated financial statements provided that the transaction is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity entering into that transaction and the foreign currency risk will affect consolidated profit or loss.</p>            </variant></body></paragraph>
