All revisions to estimated repricing dates (other than those excluded in accordance with&#xa0;<xref base="F16151628" href="IAS39_AG121.dita#IAS39_AG121" id="IAS39_X1050">paragraph AG121</xref>), including any reallocation of existing items between time periods, are included when revising the estimated amount in a time period in accordance with&#xa0;<xref base="F16151629" href="IAS39_AG126.dita#IAS39_AG126" id="IAS39_X1051">paragraph AG126(b)(ii)</xref>&#xa0;and hence when measuring effectiveness. Once ineffectiveness has been recognised as set out above, the entity establishes a new estimate of the total assets (or&#xa0;liabilities) in each repricing time period, including new assets (or&#xa0;liabilities) that have been originated since it last tested effectiveness, and designates a new amount as the&#xa0;hedged item&#xa0;and a new percentage as the hedged percentage. The procedures set out in&#xa0;<xref base="F16151630" href="IAS39_AG126.dita#IAS39_AG126" id="IAS39_X1052">paragraph AG126(b)</xref>&#xa0;are then repeated at the next date it tests effectiveness.</p></body></paragraph>
