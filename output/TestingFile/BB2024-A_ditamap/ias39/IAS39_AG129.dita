For example, assume an entity schedules items into three repricing time periods. At the previous redesignation, the change in&#xa0;fair value&#xa0;reported in the single line item in the statement of financial position was an asset of CU25. That amount represents amounts attributable to periods 1, 2 and 3 of CU7, CU8 and CU10, respectively. At the next redesignation, the assets attributable to period 1 have been either realised or rescheduled into other periods. Therefore, CU7 is derecognised from the statement of financial position and recognised in profit or loss. CU8&#xa0;and CU10 are now attributable to periods 1 and 2, respectively. These remaining periods are then adjusted, as necessary, for changes in fair value as described in&#xa0;<xref base="F16151818" href="IAS39_AG114.dita#IAS39_AG114" id="IAS39_X1059">paragraph AG114(g)</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
