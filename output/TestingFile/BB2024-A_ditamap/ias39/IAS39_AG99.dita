For a similar reason, an investment in a consolidated subsidiary cannot be a hedged item in a fair value hedge because consolidation recognises in profit or loss the subsidiary&#x2019;s profit or loss, rather than changes in the investment&#x2019;s fair value. A&#xa0;hedge of a&#xa0;net investment in a foreign operation&#xa0;is different because it is a hedge of the foreign currency exposure, not a fair value hedge of the change in the value of the investment.</p></body></paragraph>
