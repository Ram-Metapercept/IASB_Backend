Although the portfolio may, for risk management purposes, include assets and liabilities, the amount designated is an amount of assets or an amount of liabilities. Designation of a net amount including assets and liabilities is not permitted. The entity may hedge a portion of the&#xa0;interest rate risk&#xa0;associated with this designated amount. For&#xa0;example, in the case of a hedge of a portfolio containing prepayable assets, the entity may hedge the change in&#xa0;fair value&#xa0;that is attributable to a change in the hedged interest rate on the basis of expected, rather than contractual, repricing dates. When the portion hedged is based on expected repricing dates, the effect that changes in the hedged interest rate have on those expected repricing dates shall be included when determining the change in the fair value of the&#xa0;hedged item. Consequently, if a portfolio that contains prepayable items is hedged with a non&#x2011;prepayable derivative, ineffectiveness arises if the dates on which items in the hedged portfolio are expected to prepay are revised, or actual prepayment dates differ from those expected.</p></body></paragraph>
