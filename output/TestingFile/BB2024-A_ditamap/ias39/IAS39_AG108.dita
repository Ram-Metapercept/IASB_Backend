For example, an interest rate swap is likely to be an effective hedge if the notional and principal amounts, term, repricing dates, dates of interest and principal receipts and payments, and basis for measuring interest rates are the same for the hedging instrument and the hedged item. In&#xa0;addition, a hedge of a highly probable forecast purchase of a commodity with a forward contract is likely to be highly effective if:</p><ol outputclass="static" base="SL135274" type="lower-alpha" id="IAS39_L0101"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>         <p base="SL135276" id="IAS39_P1206">the forward contract is for the purchase of the same quantity of the same commodity at the same time and location as the hedged forecast purchase;</p>       </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>         <p base="SL135278" id="IAS39_P1207">the fair value of the forward contract at inception is zero; and</p>       </li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value>         <p base="SL135280" id="IAS39_P1208">either the change in the discount or premium on the forward contract is excluded from the assessment of effectiveness and recognised in profit or loss or the change in expected cash flows on the highly probable forecast transaction is based on the forward price for the commodity.</p>       </li></ol></body></paragraph>
