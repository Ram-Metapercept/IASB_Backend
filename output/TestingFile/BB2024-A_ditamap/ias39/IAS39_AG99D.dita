The entity can do so provided that the benchmark rate is less than the&#xa0;effective interest rate&#xa0;calculated on the assumption that the entity had purchased the instrument on the day it first designates the&#xa0;hedged item. For&#xa0;example, assume an entity originates a fixed rate financial asset of CU100 that has an effective interest rate of 6&#xa0;per cent at a time when LIBOR is 4 per cent. It&#xa0;begins to hedge that asset some time later when LIBOR has increased to 8&#xa0;per&#xa0;cent and the fair value of the asset has decreased to CU90. The entity calculates that if it had purchased the asset on the date it first designates it as the hedged item for its then fair value of CU90, the effective yield would have been 9.5&#xa0;per&#xa0;cent. Because LIBOR is less than this effective yield, the entity can designate a LIBOR portion of 8 per cent that consists partly of the contractual interest cash flows and partly of the difference between the current fair value (ie&#xa0;CU90) and the amount repayable on maturity (ie CU100).</p></body></paragraph>
