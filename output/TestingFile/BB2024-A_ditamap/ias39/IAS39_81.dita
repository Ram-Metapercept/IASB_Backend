For&#xa0;example, an identifiable and separately measurable portion of the interest rate exposure of an interest&#x2011;bearing asset or interest&#x2011;bearing liability may be designated as the hedged risk (such as a risk&#x2011;free interest rate or benchmark interest rate component of the total interest rate exposure of a hedged&#xa0;financial instrument).</p></body></paragraph>
