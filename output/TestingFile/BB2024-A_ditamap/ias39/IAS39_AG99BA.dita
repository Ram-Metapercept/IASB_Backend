An entity can also designate only changes in the cash flows or fair value of a hedged item above or below a specified price or other variable (a one‑sided risk). The intrinsic value of a purchased option hedging instrument (assuming that it has the same principal terms as the designated risk), but not its time value, reflects a one‑sided risk in a hedged item. For example, an entity can designate the variability of future cash flow outcomes resulting from a price increase of a forecast commodity purchase. In such a situation, only cash flow losses that result from an increase in the price above the specified level are designated. The hedged risk does not include the time value of a purchased option because the time value is not a component of the forecast transaction that affects profit or loss (<xref base="F19983393" href="IAS39_86.dita#IAS39_86" id="IAS39_X0959">paragraph 86(b)</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
