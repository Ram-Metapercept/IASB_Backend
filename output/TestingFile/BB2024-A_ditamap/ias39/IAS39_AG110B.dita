This is because the premium paid for the option includes time value and, as stated in <xref base="F16150846" href="IAS39_AG99BA.dita#IAS39_AG99BA" id="IAS39_X0996">paragraph AG99BA</xref>, a designated one‑sided risk does not include the time value of an option. Therefore, in this situation, there will be no offset between the cash flows relating to the time value of the option premium paid and the designated hedged risk.</p></body></paragraph>
