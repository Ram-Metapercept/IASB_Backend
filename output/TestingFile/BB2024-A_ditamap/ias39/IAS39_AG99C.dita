For example, in the case of a liability whose&#xa0;effective interest rate&#xa0;is below LIBOR, an entity cannot designate (a) a portion of the liability equal to the principal amount plus interest at LIBOR and (b) a negative residual portion. However, the entity may designate all of the cash flows of the entire financial asset or financial liability as the hedged item and hedge them for only one particular risk (eg only for changes that are attributable to changes in LIBOR). For example, in the case of a financial liability whose effective interest rate is 100 basis points below LIBOR, an entity can designate as the hedged item the entire liability (ie principal plus interest at LIBOR minus 100 basis points) and hedge the change in the fair value or cash flows of that entire liability that is attributable to changes in LIBOR. The entity may also choose a hedge ratio of other than one to one in order to improve the&#xa0;effectiveness of the hedge&#xa0;as described in&#xa0;<xref base="F16149832" href="IAS39_AG100.dita#IAS39_AG100" id="IAS39_X0962">paragraph AG100</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
