Consequently, if a parent recognises regulatory deferral account balances in its consolidated financial statements in accordance with this Standard, it shall apply the same accounting policies to the regulatory deferral account balances arising in all of its subsidiaries. This shall apply irrespective of whether the subsidiaries recognise those balances in their own financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
