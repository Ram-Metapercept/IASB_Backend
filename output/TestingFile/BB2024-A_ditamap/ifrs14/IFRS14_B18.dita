Consequently, if an entity acquires a business, it shall apply, in its consolidated financial statements, its accounting policies established in accordance with paragraphs 11–12 for the recognition and measurement of the acquiree’s regulatory deferral account balances at the date of acquisition.              The acquiree’s regulatory deferral account balances shall be recognised in the consolidated financial statements of the acquirer in accordance with the acquirer’s policies, irrespective of whether the acquiree recognises those balances in its own financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
