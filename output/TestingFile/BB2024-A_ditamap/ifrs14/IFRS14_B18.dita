The acquiree&#x2019;s regulatory deferral account balances shall be recognised in the consolidated financial statements of the acquirer in accordance with the acquirer&#x2019;s policies, irrespective of whether the acquiree recognises those balances in its own financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
