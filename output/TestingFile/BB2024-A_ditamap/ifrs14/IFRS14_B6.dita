<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><!DOCTYPE paragraph PUBLIC "-//IFRS//DTD DITA Paragraph//EN" "../../../DocTypes/com.ifrs.doctype/dtd/paragraph.dtd"><paragraph base="F29577741" id="IFRS14_B6"><paranum class="- topic/title paragraph/paranum "/><titlealts><navtitle>B6</navtitle></titlealts><prolog><data name="standard_number" value="IFRS 14"/><data name="paranum" value="B6"/></prolog><body><p id="IFRS14_P0138">Regulatory deferral account balances usually represent timing differences between the recognition of items of income or expenses for regulatory purposes and the recognition of those items for financial reporting purposes. When an entity changes an accounting policy on the first-time adoption of IFRS or on the initial application of a new or revised Standard, new or revised timing differences may arise that create new or revised regulatory deferral account balances. The prohibition in <xref base="F33214465" href="IFRS14_13.dita#IFRS14_13" id="IFRS14_X0170">paragraph 13</xref> that prevents an entity from changing its accounting policy in order to start to recognise regulatory deferral account balances does not prohibit the recognition of the new or revised regulatory deferral account balances that are created because of other changes in accounting policies required by IFRS. This is because the recognition of regulatory deferral account balances for such timing differences would be consistent with the existing recognition policy applied in accordance with <xref base="F33214466" href="IFRS14_11.dita#IFRS14_11" id="IFRS14_X0171">paragraph 11</xref> and would not represent the introduction of a new accounting policy. Similarly, paragraph 13 does not prohibit the recognition of regulatory deferral account balances arising from timing differences that did not exist immediately prior to the date of transition to IFRS but are consistent with the entity’s accounting policies established in accordance with paragraph 11 (for example, storm damage costs).            </p></body></paragraph>
