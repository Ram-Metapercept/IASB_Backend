However, with acquisitions, diversification and deregulation, rate regulation may now apply to only a portion of an entity’s activities, resulting in it having both regulated and non-regulated activities. This Standard applies only to the rate-regulated activities that are subject to statutory or regulatory restrictions through the actions of a rate regulator, regardless of the type of entity or the industry to which it belongs.</p></body></paragraph>
