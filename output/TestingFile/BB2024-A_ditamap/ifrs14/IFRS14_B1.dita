However, with acquisitions, diversification and deregulation, rate regulation may now apply to only a portion of an entity&#x2019;s activities, resulting in it having both regulated and non-regulated activities. This Standard applies only to the&#xa0;rate-regulated activities&#xa0;that are subject to statutory or regulatory restrictions through the actions of a&#xa0;rate regulator, regardless of the type of entity or the industry to which it belongs.</p></body></paragraph>
