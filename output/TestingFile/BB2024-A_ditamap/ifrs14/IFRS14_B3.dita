Some items of expense (income) may be outside the regulated rate(s) because, for example, the amounts are not expected to be accepted by the rate regulator or because they are not within the scope of the rate regulation. Consequently, such an item is recognised as income or expense as incurred, unless another Standard permits or requires it to be included in the carrying amount of an asset or liability.</p></body></paragraph>
