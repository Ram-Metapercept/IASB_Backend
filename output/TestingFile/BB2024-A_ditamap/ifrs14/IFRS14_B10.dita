In such circumstances, this might result in the entity recognising a regulatory deferral account balance in the statement of financial position related to income tax, in accordance with its accounting policies established in accordance with <xref base="F33214583" href="IFRS14_g11-12.dita#IFRS14_g11-12" id="IFRS14_X0178">paragraphs 11–12</xref>. The recognition of this regulatory deferral account balance that relates to income tax might itself create an additional temporary difference              for which a further deferred tax amount would be recognised.</p></body></paragraph>
