A primary issue in accounting for inventories is the amount of cost to be recognised as an asset and carried forward until the related revenues are recognised. This Standard provides guidance on the determination of cost and its subsequent recognition as an expense, including any write&#x2011;down to net realisable value. It also provides guidance on the cost formulas  that are used to assign costs to inventories.</p></body></paragraph>
