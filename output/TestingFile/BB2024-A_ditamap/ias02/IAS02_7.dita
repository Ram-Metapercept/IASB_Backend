Fair value reflects the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the same inventory in the principal (or most advantageous) market  for that inventory would take place between market participants  at the measurement date . The former is an entity‑specific value; the latter is not. Net realisable value for inventories may not equal fair value less costs to sell.</p></body></paragraph>
