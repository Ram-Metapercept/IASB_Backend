Contract prices are not necessarily relevant in measuring fair value, because fair value reflects the current market conditions in which market participant  buyers and sellers would enter into a transaction. As a result, the fair value of a biological asset or agricultural produce is not adjusted because of the existence of a contract. In some cases, a contract for the sale of a biological asset or agricultural produce may be an onerous contract, as defined in <xref id="IAS41_X0127" base="F391382" href="../IAS37.ditamap">IAS 37 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets</ph></ph></xref>. <xref id="IAS41_X0128" base="F391399" href="../IAS37.ditamap">IAS 37</xref> applies to onerous contracts. </p></body></paragraph>
