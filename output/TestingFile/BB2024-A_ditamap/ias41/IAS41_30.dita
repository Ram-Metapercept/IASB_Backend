However, that presumption can be rebutted only on initial recognition for a biological asset for which quoted market prices              are not available and for which alternative fair value measurements              are determined to be clearly unreliable. In such a case, that biological asset shall be measured at its cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Once the fair value of such a biological asset becomes reliably measurable, an entity shall measure it at its fair value less costs to sell. Once a non‑current              biological asset meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale (or is included in a disposal group that is classified as held for sale)              in accordance with <xref base="F1100562" href="../ifrs05/IFRS05_TOC.dita" scope="local" id="IAS41_X0140">IFRS 5 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Non‑current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations</ph></ph></xref>, it is presumed that fair value can be measured reliably.</p></body></paragraph>
