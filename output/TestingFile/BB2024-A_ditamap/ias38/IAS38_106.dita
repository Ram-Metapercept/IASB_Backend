For example, it may become apparent that a diminishing balance method of amortisation is appropriate rather than a straight&#x2011;line method. Another example is if use of the rights represented by a licence is deferred pending action on other components of the business plan. In&#xa0;this case, economic benefits that flow from the asset may not be received until later periods.</p></body></paragraph>
