The whole surplus may be realised on the retirement or disposal of the asset. However, some of the surplus may be realised as the asset is used by the entity; in such a case, the amount of the surplus realised is the difference between amortisation based on the revalued carrying amount of the asset and amortisation that would have been recognised based on the asset&#x2019;s historical cost. The transfer from revaluation surplus to retained earnings is not made through profit or loss.</p></body></paragraph>
