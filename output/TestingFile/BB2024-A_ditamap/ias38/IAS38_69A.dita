Similarly, it has a       right to access goods when they have been constructed by a supplier in accordance with the       terms of a supply contract and the entity could demand delivery of them in return for payment.       Services are received when they are performed by a supplier in accordance with a contract to       deliver them to the entity and not when the entity uses them to deliver another service, for       example, to deliver an advertisement to customers.</p></body></paragraph>
