The capacity of an entity to control the future economic benefits       from an intangible asset would normally stem       from legal rights that are enforceable in a court of law. In the absence of legal rights, it       is more difficult to demonstrate control. However, legal enforceability of a right is not a       necessary condition for control because an entity may be able to control the future economic       benefits in some other way.</p></body></paragraph>
