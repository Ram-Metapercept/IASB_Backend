This may happen when a government transfers or allocates to an entity intangible assets such as airport landing rights, licences to operate radio or television stations, import licences or quotas or rights to access other restricted resources. In accordance with <xref id="IAS38_X0235" base="SL12116477" href="../ias20/IAS20_TOC0001.dita#IAS20_TOC0001">IAS 20 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance</ph></ph></xref>, an entity may choose to recognise both the intangible asset and the grant initially at fair value. If an entity chooses not to recognise the asset initially at fair value, the entity recognises the asset initially at a nominal amount (the other treatment permitted by <xref id="IAS38_X0236" base="SL12116481" href="../ias20/IAS20_TOC0001.dita#IAS20_TOC0001">IAS 20</xref>) plus any expenditure that is directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use.</p></body></paragraph>
