In other words, the entity expects there to be an inflow of economic benefits, even if there is uncertainty about the timing or the amount of the inflow. Therefore, the probability recognition criterion in <xref id="IAS38_X0214" base="A38-193" href="IAS38_21.dita#IAS38_21">paragraph 21(a)</xref> is always considered to be satisfied for separately acquired intangible assets.</p></body></paragraph>
