Amortisation shall begin when the asset is available for use, ie when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Amortisation shall cease at the earlier of the date that the asset is classified as held for sale (or included in a disposal group that is classified as held for sale)  in accordance with <xref base="F16456282" href="../ifrs05/IFRS05_TOC.dita#IFRS05_TOC0001" id="IAS38_X0298">IFRS 5</xref> and the date that the asset is derecognised. The amortisation method used shall reflect the pattern in which the asset’s future economic benefits  are expected to be consumed by the entity. If that pattern cannot be determined reliably, the straight‑line method shall be used. The amortisation charge for each period shall be recognised in profit or loss unless this or another Standard permits or requires it to be included in the carrying amount of another asset.</p></body></paragraph>
