However, if only part of the cost of an intangible asset is recognised as an asset because the asset did not meet the criteria for recognition until part of the way through the process (see <xref id="IAS38_X0279" base="SL197220" href="IAS38_65.dita#IAS38_65">paragraph 65</xref>), the revaluation model may be applied to the whole of that asset. Also, the revaluation model may be applied to an intangible asset that was received by way of a government grant and recognised at a nominal amount (see <xref id="IAS38_X0280" base="A38-205" href="IAS38_44.dita#IAS38_44">paragraph 44</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
