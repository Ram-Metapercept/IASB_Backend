For example, the contract that sets out the entity&#x2019;s rights over its         use of an intangible asset might specify the entity&#x2019;s use of the intangible asset as a         predetermined number of years (ie&#xa0;time), as a number of units produced or as a fixed total         amount of revenue to be generated. Identification of such a predominant limiting factor         could serve as the starting point for the identification of the appropriate basis of         amortisation, but another basis may be applied if it more closely reflects the expected         pattern of consumption of economic benefits.       </p>     </variant></body></paragraph>
