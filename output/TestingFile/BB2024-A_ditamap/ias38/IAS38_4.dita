In determining whether an asset that incorporates both intangible and tangible elements should be treated under <xref base="F16456246" href="../ias16/IAS16_TOC.dita#IAS16_TOC0001" id="IAS38_X0169">IAS 16 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Property, Plant and Equipment</ph></ph></xref> or as an intangible asset under this Standard, an entity uses judgement to assess which element is more significant. For example, computer software for a computer‑controlled machine tool that cannot operate without that specific software is an integral part of the related hardware and it is treated as property, plant and equipment. The same applies to the operating system of a computer. When the software is not an integral part of the related hardware, computer software is treated as an intangible asset.</p></body></paragraph>
