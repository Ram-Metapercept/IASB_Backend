Therefore, an investment property generates cash flows largely independently of the other assets held by an entity. This distinguishes investment property from owner‑occupied property. The production or supply of goods or services (or the use of property for administrative purposes) generates cash flows that are attributable not only to property, but also to other assets used in the production or supply process. <xref base="F46591035" href="../IAS16.ditamap" id="IAS40_X0139">IAS 16</xref> applies to owned owner‑occupied property                  and <xref base="F46976508" href="../ifrs16/IFRS16_TOC.dita#IFRS16_TOC0001" id="IAS40_X0141"><ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 16</ph> <ph outputclass="standard_title">Leases</ph></ph></xref> applies to owner-occupied property held by a lessee as a right-of-use asset.</p>     </variant></body></paragraph>
