The property does not qualify as investment property in the consolidated financial statements, because the property is owner‑occupied from the perspective of the group. However, from the perspective of the entity that owns it, the property is investment property if it meets the definition in <xref id="IAS40_X0165" base="A40-130" href="IAS40_5.dita#IAS40_5">paragraph 5</xref>. Therefore, the lessor treats the property as investment property in its individual financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
