For example, the interior walls may be replacements of original walls. Under the recognition principle, an entity recognises in the carrying amount of an investment property the cost of replacing part of an existing investment property at the time that cost is incurred if the recognition criteria  are met. The carrying amount of those parts that are replaced is derecognised in accordance with the derecognition provisions of this Standard.</p></body></paragraph>
