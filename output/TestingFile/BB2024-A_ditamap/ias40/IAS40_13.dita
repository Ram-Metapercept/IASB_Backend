For example, the owner of a hotel sometimes transfers some responsibilities to third parties under a management contract. The terms of such contracts vary widely. At one end of the spectrum, the owner&#x2019;s position may, in substance, be that of a passive investor. At the other end of the spectrum, the owner may simply have outsourced day&#x2011;to&#x2011;day functions while retaining significant exposure to variation in the cash flows generated by the operations of the hotel.</p></body></paragraph>
