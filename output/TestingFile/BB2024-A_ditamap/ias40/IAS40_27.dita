The following discussion refers to an exchange of one non‑monetary asset for another, but it also applies to all exchanges described in the preceding sentence. The cost of such an investment property is measured at fair value unless (a) the exchange transaction lacks commercial substance  or (b) the fair value of neither the asset received nor the asset given up is reliably measurable . The acquired asset is measured in this way even if an entity cannot immediately derecognise the asset given up. If the acquired asset is not measured at fair value, its cost is measured at the carrying amount of the asset given up.</p></body></paragraph>
