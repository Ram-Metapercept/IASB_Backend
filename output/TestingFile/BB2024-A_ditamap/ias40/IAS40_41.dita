When lease payments are at market rates, the fair value of an investment property held by a lessee as a right-of-use asset at acquisition, net of all expected lease payments (including those relating to recognised lease liabilities), should be zero. Thus, remeasuring a right-of-use asset from cost in accordance with IFRS&#xa0;16 to fair value in accordance with <xref base="F46591407" href="IAS40_g33-55.dita#IAS40_g33-55/IAS40_g33-55_TI" id="IAS40_X0234">paragraph 33</xref> (taking into account the requirements in <xref base="F46976513" href="IAS40_50.dita#IAS40_50/IAS40_50_V2" id="IAS40_X0235">paragraph&#xa0;50</xref>) should not give rise to any initial gain or loss, unless fair value is measured at different times. This could occur when an election to apply the fair value model is made after initial recognition.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
