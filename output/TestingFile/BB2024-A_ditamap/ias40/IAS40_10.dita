If these portions could be sold separately (or leased out separately under a finance lease), an entity accounts for the portions separately. If the portions could not be sold separately, the property is investment property only if an insignificant portion  is held for use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes.</p></body></paragraph>
