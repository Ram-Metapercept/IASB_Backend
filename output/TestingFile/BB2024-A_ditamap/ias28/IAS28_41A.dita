It may not be         possible to identify a single, discrete event that caused the impairment. Rather the         combined effect of several events may have caused the impairment. Losses expected as a         result of future events, no matter how likely, are not recognised. Objective evidence that         the net investment is impaired includes observable data that comes to the attention of the         entity about the following loss events:</p><ol outputclass="static" id="IAS28_L0008" base="F36676970" type="lower-alpha"><li id="IAS28_41A_a"><li_value>(a)</li_value>           <p id="IAS28_P0140" base="F36676971">significant financial difficulty of the associate or             joint venture;</p>         </li><li id="IAS28_41A_b"><li_value>(b)</li_value>           <p id="IAS28_P0141" base="F36676973">a breach of contract, such as a default or             delinquency in payments by the associate or joint venture;</p>         </li><li id="IAS28_41A_c"><li_value>(c)</li_value>           <p id="IAS28_P0142" base="F36676975">the entity, for economic or legal reasons relating to             its associate’s or joint venture’s financial difficulty, granting to the associate or             joint venture a concession that the entity would not otherwise consider;</p>         </li><li id="IAS28_41A_d"><li_value>(d)</li_value>           <p id="IAS28_P0143" base="F36676977">it becoming probable that the associate or joint             venture will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or</p>         </li><li id="IAS28_41A_e"><li_value>(e)</li_value>           <p id="IAS28_P0144" base="F36676979">the disappearance of an active market for the net             investment because of financial difficulties of the associate or joint venture.</p>         </li></ol></body></paragraph>
