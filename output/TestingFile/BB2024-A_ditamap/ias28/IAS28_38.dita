The interest in an associate or a joint venture is the carrying amount of the investment in the associate or joint venture determined using the&#xa0;equity method&#xa0;together with any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the entity&#x2019;s net investment in the associate or joint venture. For example, an item for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future is, in substance, an extension of the entity&#x2019;s investment in that associate or joint venture. Such items may include preference shares and long-term receivables or loans, but do not include trade receivables, trade payables or any long-term receivables for which adequate collateral exists, such as secured loans.              Losses recognised using the equity method in excess of the entity&#x2019;s investment in ordinary shares are applied to the other components of the entity&#x2019;s interest in an associate or a joint venture in the reverse order of their seniority (ie priority in liquidation).</p></body></paragraph>
