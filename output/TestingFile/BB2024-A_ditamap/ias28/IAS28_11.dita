Because the investor has joint control of, or significant influence over, the investee, the investor has an interest in the associate&#x2019;s or joint venture&#x2019;s performance and, as a result, the return on its investment. The investor accounts for this interest by extending the scope of its financial statements to include its share of the profit or loss of such an investee. As a result, application of the equity method provides more informative reporting of the investor&#x2019;s net assets and profit or loss.</p></body></paragraph>
