Therefore, all benefit is attributed to periods ending on or before that date. Benefit is attributed to individual accounting periods under the plan&#x2019;s benefit formula.  However, if an employee&#x2019;s service in later years will lead to a materially higher level of benefit than in earlier years, an entity attributes benefit on a straight&#x2011;line basis until the date when further service by the employee will lead to no material amount of further benefits. That is because the employee&#x2019;s service throughout the entire period will ultimately lead to benefit at that higher level.</p><table id="IAS19_TAB0007" base="F16150527" frame="all" orient="port"><tgroup cols="2"><colspec colnum="1" colname="C1" colwidth="5*" colsep="0" rowsep="0" align="left"/><colspec colnum="2" colname="C2" colwidth="95*" colsep="0" rowsep="0" align="left"/><thead><row><entry namest="C1" nameend="C2" rowsep="1" align="left"> Examples illustrating <xref id="IAS19_X0338" base="F16227370" href="#IAS19_73">paragraph 73</xref></entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname="C1" align="left" valign="top"> <p id="IAS19_P0419" base="F16150530">1</p></entry><entry colname="C2" align="left" valign="top"> <p id="IAS19_P0420" base="F16150529">A plan pays a lump sum benefit of CU1,000 that vests after ten years of service.
