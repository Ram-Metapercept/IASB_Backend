Some entities provide a lower level of benefit for termination of employment at the request of the employee (in substance, a post&#x2011;employment benefit) than for termination of employment at the request of the entity. The difference between the benefit provided for termination of employment at the request of the employee and a higher benefit provided at the request of the entity is a termination benefit.</p></body></paragraph>
