The payment of such benefits is certain (subject to any vesting or minimum service requirements) but the timing of their payment is uncertain. Although such benefits are described in some jurisdictions as termination indemnities or termination gratuities, they are post&#x2011;employment benefits rather than termination benefits, and an entity accounts for them as post&#x2011;employment benefits.</p></body></paragraph>
