Accumulating paid absences may be either vesting (in other words, employees are entitled to a cash payment for unused entitlement on leaving the entity) or non&#x2011;vesting (when employees are not entitled to a cash payment for unused entitlement on leaving). An obligation arises as employees render service that increases their entitlement to future paid absences. The obligation exists, and is recognised, even if the paid absences are non&#x2011;vesting, although the possibility that employees may leave before they use an accumulated non&#x2011;vesting entitlement affects the measurement of that obligation.</p></body></paragraph>
