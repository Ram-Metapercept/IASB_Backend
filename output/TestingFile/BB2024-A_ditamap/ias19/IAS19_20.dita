Such plans create a constructive obligation as employees render service that increases the amount to be paid if they remain in service until the end of the specified period. The measurement of such constructive obligations reflects the possibility that some employees may leave without receiving profit‑sharing payments.</p><table id="IAS19_TAB0002" base="F16150002" frame="all" orient="port"><tgroup cols="1"><colspec colnum="1" colname="C1" colwidth="100*" colsep="0" rowsep="0" align="left"/><thead><row><entry colname="C1" rowsep="1" align="left"> Example illustrating paragraph 20</entry></row></thead><tbody><row keep_together="1"><entry colname="C1"> <p id="IAS19_P0150" base="F16150004">A profit‑sharing plan requires an entity to pay a specified proportion of its profit for the year to employees who serve throughout the year.
