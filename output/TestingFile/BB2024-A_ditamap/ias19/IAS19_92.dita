Contributions by employees reduce the cost of the benefits to the entity. An entity considers whether third&#x2011;party contributions reduce the cost of the benefits to the entity, or are a reimbursement right as described in <xref id="IAS19_X0359" base="F16227466" href="IAS19_116.dita#IAS19_116">paragraph 116</xref>. Contributions by employees or third parties are either set out in the formal terms of the plan (or arise from a constructive obligation that goes beyond those terms), or are discretionary. Discretionary contributions by employees or third parties reduce service cost upon payment of these contributions to the plan.</p></body></paragraph>
