An example of contributions that are not linked to service is when the contributions are required to reduce a deficit arising from losses on plan assets or from actuarial losses.                  If contributions from employees or third parties are linked to service, those contributions reduce the service cost as follows:</p>       <ol outputclass="static" base="F28550535" type="lower-alpha" id="IAS19_L0058"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>           <p base="F28550536" id="IAS19_P0496">if the amount of the contributions is dependent on the number of years of service, an entity shall attribute the contributions to periods of service using the same attribution method required by <xref base="F28550537" href="IAS19_70.dita#IAS19_70" id="IAS19_X0362">paragraph 70</xref> for the gross benefit (ie either using the plan’s contribution formula or on a straight-line basis); or                        </p>         </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>           <p base="F28550539" id="IAS19_P0497">if the amount of the contributions is independent of the number of years of service, the entity is permitted to recognise such contributions as a reduction of the service cost in the period in which the related service is rendered.                          Examples of contributions that are independent of the number of years of service include those that are a fixed percentage of the employee’s salary, a fixed amount throughout the service period or dependent on the employee’s age.                        </p>         </li></ol>       <p base="F28550540" id="IAS19_P0498"><xref base="F34942955" href="IAS19_A1.dita#IAS19_A1" id="IAS19_X0366">Paragraph A1</xref> provides related application guidance.</p>     </variant></body></paragraph>
