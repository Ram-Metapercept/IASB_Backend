It rejects arguments against the quantification of the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits. Accordingly, the formats described in <xref id="IAS26_X0025" base="F1219502" href="IAS26_g28-31.dita#IAS26_g28-31/IAS26_g28-31_TI">paragraph 28(a) and (b)</xref> are considered acceptable under this Standard, as is the format described in <xref id="IAS26_X0026" base="F1219503" href="IAS26_g28-31.dita#IAS26_g28-31/IAS26_g28-31_TI">paragraph 28(c)</xref> so long as the financial statements contain a reference to, and are accompanied by, an actuarial report that includes the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits.</p></body></paragraph>
