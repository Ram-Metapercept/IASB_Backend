If an entity makes similar assets for sale in the normal course of business, the cost of the asset is usually the same as the cost of constructing an asset for sale (see <xref id="IAS16_X0137" base="F16451489" href="../ias02/IAS02_TOC0001.dita#IAS02_TOC0001">IAS&#xa0;2</xref>). Therefore, any internal profits are eliminated in arriving at such costs. Similarly, the cost of abnormal amounts of wasted material, labour, or other resources incurred in self&#x2011;constructing an asset is not included in the cost of the asset. <xref id="IAS16_X0138" base="F78010723" href="../ias23/IAS23_TOC0001.dita#IAS23_TOC0001">IAS&#xa0;23 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Borrowing Costs</ph></ph></xref> establishes criteria for the recognition of interest as a component of the carrying amount of a self&#x2011;constructed item of property, plant and equipment.</p></body></paragraph>
