Similarly, some         entities issue groups of insurance contracts with direct participation features and hold the         underlying items. Some such funds or underlying items include owner-occupied property. The         entity applies IAS 16 to owner-occupied properties that are included in such a fund or are         underlying items. Despite paragraph 29, the entity may elect to measure such properties         using the fair value model in accordance with IAS 40. For the purposes of this election,         insurance contracts include investment contracts with discretionary participation features.         (See IFRS 17 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Insurance Contracts</ph></ph> for terms used in this         paragraph that are defined in that Standard).</p></body></paragraph>
