Depreciation of an asset ceases at the earlier of the date that the asset is classified as held for sale (or included in a disposal group that is classified as held for sale) in accordance with <xref base="F16451572" href="../ifrs05/IFRS05_TOC.dita#IFRS05_TOC0001" id="IAS16_X0187">IFRS&#xa0;5</xref>  and the date that the asset is derecognised.  Therefore, depreciation does not cease when the asset becomes idle or is retired from active use unless the asset is fully depreciated. However, under usage methods of depreciation the depreciation charge can be zero while there is no production.</p></body></paragraph>
