Rather, these costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Costs of day‑to‑day servicing are primarily the costs of labour and consumables, and may include the cost of small parts. The purpose of these expenditures is often described as for the ‘repairs and maintenance’ of the item of property, plant and equipment.</p></body></paragraph>
