Rather, these costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Costs of day&#x2011;to&#x2011;day servicing are primarily the costs of labour and consumables, and may include the cost of small parts. The purpose of these expenditures is often described as for the &#x2018;repairs and maintenance&#x2019; of the item of property, plant and equipment.</p></body></paragraph>
