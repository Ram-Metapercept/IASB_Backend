This may, for example, occur upon the public listing of an entity&#x2019;s equity instruments or upon the restructuring of an entity&#x2019;s equity. It may also occur upon a controlling shareholder&#x2019;s move to a foreign country. As a result of such an event, an entity may be taxed differently; it may for example gain or lose tax incentives or become subject to a different rate of tax in the future.</p></body></paragraph>
