In accordance with <xref base="F8123254" href="IFRS01_14.dita#IFRS01_14" id="IFRS01_X0154">paragraph 14</xref>, an entity shall treat the receipt of that information in the same way as non‑adjusting events after the reporting period in accordance with <xref base="F15825502" href="../ias10/IAS10_TOC0001.dita#IAS10_TOC0001" id="IFRS01_X0155">IAS 10 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Events after the Reporting Period</ph></ph></xref>.              For example, assume that an entity’s date of transition to IFRSs is 1 January 20X4 and new information on 15 July 20X4 requires the revision of an estimate made in accordance with previous GAAP at 31 December 20X3. The entity shall not reflect that new information in its opening IFRS statement of financial position (unless the estimates need adjustment for any differences in accounting policies or there is objective evidence that the estimates were in error).              Instead, the entity shall reflect that new information in profit or loss              (or, if appropriate, other comprehensive income) for the year ended 31 December 20X4.</p></body></paragraph>
