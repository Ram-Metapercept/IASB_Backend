For example, if in a business combination an entity recognises goodwill of CU100 that has a tax base of nil, <xref id="IAS12_X0148" base="F1246148" href="IAS12_g15-45.dita#IAS12_g15-45/IAS12_g15-45_TI">paragraph 15(a)</xref> prohibits the entity from recognising the resulting deferred tax liability. If the entity subsequently recognises an impairment loss of CU20 for that goodwill, the amount of the taxable temporary difference relating to the goodwill is reduced from CU100 to CU80, with a resulting decrease in the value of the unrecognised deferred tax liability. That decrease in the value of the unrecognised deferred tax liability is also regarded as relating to the initial recognition of the goodwill and is therefore prohibited from being recognised under <xref id="IAS12_X0149" base="F1246149" href="IAS12_g15-45.dita#IAS12_g15-45/IAS12_g15-45_TI">paragraph 15(a)</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
