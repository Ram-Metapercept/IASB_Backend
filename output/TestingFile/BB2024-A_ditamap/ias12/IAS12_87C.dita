In such cases, an entity considers this in determining the information to be disclosed under <xref id="IAS12_X0369" base="F1246878" href="IAS12_82A.dita#IAS12_82A">paragraph 82A</xref>. For example, an entity may be required to disclose the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries for which no deferred tax liabilities have been recognised (see&#xa0;<xref id="IAS12_X0370" base="A12-244" href="IAS12_81.dita#IAS12_81">paragraph 81(f)</xref>). If it is impracticable to compute the amounts of unrecognised deferred tax liabilities (see <xref id="IAS12_X0371" base="A12-245" href="IAS12_87.dita#IAS12_87">paragraph 87</xref>) there may be amounts of potential income tax  consequences of dividends not practicably determinable related to these subsidiaries.</p></body></paragraph>
