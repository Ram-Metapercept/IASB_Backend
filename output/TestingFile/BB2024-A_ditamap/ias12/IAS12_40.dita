Furthermore, it would often be impracticable to determine the amount of income taxes  that would be payable when the temporary difference reverses. Therefore, when the parent has determined that those profits will not be distributed in the foreseeable future the parent does not recognise a deferred tax liability. The same considerations apply to investments in branches.</p></body></paragraph>
