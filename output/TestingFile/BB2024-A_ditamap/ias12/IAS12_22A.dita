For       example, at the commencement date of a lease, a lessee typically recognises a lease liability       and the corresponding amount as part of the cost of a right-of-use asset. Depending on the       applicable tax law, equal taxable  and deductible temporary differences may arise on initial       recognition of the asset and liability in such a transaction. The exemption provided by <xref href="IAS12_15.dita">paragraphs 15</xref> and <xref href="IAS12_24.dita">24</xref> does not       apply to such temporary differences and an entity recognises any resulting deferred tax liability and asset.</p></body></paragraph>
