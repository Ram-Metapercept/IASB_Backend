Temporary differences arise when the tax bases of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are not affected by the business combination or are affected differently. For example, when the carrying amount of an asset is increased to fair value but the tax base of the asset remains at cost to the previous owner, a taxable temporary difference arises which results in a deferred tax liability. The resulting deferred tax liability affects goodwill (see <xref id="IAS12_X0121" base="A12-203" href="IAS12_66.dita#IAS12_66">paragraph 66</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
