When the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its tax base, the amount of taxable economic benefits will exceed the amount that will be allowed as a deduction for tax purposes. This difference is a taxable temporary difference and the obligation to pay the resulting income taxes  in future periods is a deferred tax liability. As the entity recovers the carrying amount of the asset, the taxable temporary difference will reverse and the entity will have taxable profit. This makes it probable that economic benefits will flow from the entity in the form of tax payments. Therefore, this Standard requires the recognition of all deferred tax liabilities, except in certain circumstances described in <xref id="IAS12_X0102" base="F1245857" href="IAS12_15.dita#IAS12_15">paragraphs 15</xref> and <xref id="IAS12_X0103" base="F1245858" href="IAS12_39.dita#IAS12_39">39</xref>. </p><table id="IAS12_TAB0003" base="SL77435" frame="all" orient="port"><tgroup cols="1"><colspec colnum="1" colname="C1" colwidth="100*" colsep="0" rowsep="0" align="left"/><thead><row><entry colname="C1" rowsep="1" align="left"> Example</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname="C1" align="left" valign="top"> <p id="IAS12_P0083" base="SL143807">An asset which cost 150 has a carrying amount of 100.

To&#xa0;recover the carrying amount of 100, the entity must earn taxable income of 100, but will only be able to deduct tax depreciation of 60. Consequently, the entity will pay income taxes</i>  <i>of 10 (40 at 25%) when it recovers the carrying amount of the asset. The difference between the carrying amount of 100 and the tax base of 60 is a taxable temporary difference of 40. Therefore, the entity recognises a deferred tax liability of 10 (40 at 25%) representing the income taxes that it will pay when it recovers the carrying amount of the asset.</i></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></body></paragraph>
