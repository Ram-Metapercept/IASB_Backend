In some jurisdictions, the tax base of the liability component on initial recognition is equal to the initial carrying amount of the sum of the liability and equity components. The resulting taxable temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of the equity component separately from the liability component. Therefore, the exception set out in <xref base="F1246152" href="IAS12_g15-45.dita#IAS12_g15-45/IAS12_g15-45_TI" id="IAS12_X0158">paragraph 15(b)</xref> does not apply. Consequently, an entity recognises the resulting deferred tax liability. In accordance with <xref base="F4916694" href="IAS12_61A.dita#IAS12_61A" id="IAS12_X0159">paragraph 61A</xref>, the deferred tax is charged directly to the carrying amount of the equity component. In accordance with <xref base="A12-211" href="IAS12_58.dita#IAS12_58" id="IAS12_X0160">paragraph 58</xref>, subsequent changes in the deferred tax liability are recognised in profit or loss as deferred tax expense (income).</p></body></paragraph>
