If the amount the taxation authorities will permit as a deduction in future periods is not known at the end of the period, it shall be estimated, based on information available at the end of the period. For example, if the amount that the taxation authorities will permit as a deduction in future periods is dependent upon the entity&#x2019;s share price at a future date, the measurement of the deductible temporary difference should be based on the entity&#x2019;s share price at the end of the period.</p></body></paragraph>
