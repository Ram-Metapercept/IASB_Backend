Such temporary differences are often described as timing differences. The following are examples of temporary differences of this kind which are taxable temporary differences and which therefore result in deferred tax liabilities: </p><ol outputclass="static" id="IAS12_L0006" base="SL143809" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IAS12_P0086" base="SL143811">interest revenue is included in accounting profit on a time proportion basis but may, in some jurisdictions, be included in taxable profit when cash is collected.

The temporary difference is the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its tax base which is the original cost of the asset less all deductions in respect of that asset permitted by the taxation authorities in determining taxable profit of the current and prior periods. A taxable temporary difference arises, and results in a deferred tax liability, when tax depreciation is accelerated (if tax depreciation is less rapid than accounting depreciation, a deductible temporary difference arises, and results in a deferred tax asset); and</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IAS12_P0088" base="SL143815">development costs may be capitalised  and amortised over future periods in determining accounting profit but deducted in determining taxable profit in the period in which they are incurred.
