However, the existence of unused tax losses is strong evidence that future taxable profit may not be available. Therefore, when an entity has a history of recent losses, the entity recognises a deferred tax asset arising from unused tax losses or tax credits only to the extent that the entity has sufficient taxable temporary differences or there is convincing other evidence that sufficient taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses or unused tax credits can be utilised by the entity. In such circumstances, <xref id="IAS12_X0211" base="A12-216" href="IAS12_82.dita#IAS12_82">paragraph 82</xref> requires disclosure of the amount of the deferred tax asset and the nature of the evidence supporting its recognition.</p></body></paragraph>
