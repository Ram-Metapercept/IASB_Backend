The amount of that tax deduction may differ from the related cumulative remuneration expense, and may arise in a later accounting period. For example, in some jurisdictions, an entity may recognise an expense for the consumption of employee services received as consideration for share options granted, in accordance with <xref base="F16452017" href="../ifrs02/IFRS02_TOC.dita#IFRS02_TOC0001" id="IAS12_X0321">IFRS 2 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Share‑based Payment</ph></ph></xref>,  and not receive a tax deduction until the share options are exercised, with the measurement of the tax deduction based on the entity’s share price at the date of exercise.</p></body></paragraph>
