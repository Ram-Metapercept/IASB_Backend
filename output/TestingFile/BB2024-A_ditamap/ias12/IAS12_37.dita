The entity recognises a previously unrecognised deferred tax asset to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.  For example, an improvement in trading conditions may make it more probable that the entity will be able to generate sufficient taxable profit in the future for the deferred tax asset to meet the recognition criteria set out in <xref id="IAS12_X0215" base="A12-218" href="IAS12_24.dita#IAS12_24">paragraph 24</xref> or <xref id="IAS12_X0216" base="F1246283" href="IAS12_g34-36.dita#IAS12_g34-36/IAS12_g34-36_TI">34</xref>. Another example is when an entity reassesses deferred tax assets at the date of a business combination or subsequently (see <xref id="IAS12_X0217" base="F16451926" href="IAS12_67.dita#IAS12_67">paragraphs 67 and 68</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
