A temporary difference exists between the carrying amount of the liability and its tax base; the tax base of the liability is usually nil. Such a deductible temporary difference results in a deferred tax asset as economic benefits will flow to the entity in the form of a deduction from taxable profits when contributions or retirement benefits are paid;</p>         </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>           <p base="SL49513876" id="IAS12_P0151">research costs are recognised as an expense in determining accounting profit in the period in which they are incurred                          but may not be permitted as a deduction in determining taxable profit (tax loss) until a later period. The difference between the tax base of the research costs, being the amount the taxation authorities will permit as a deduction in future periods, and the carrying amount of nil is a deductible temporary difference that results in a deferred tax asset;</p>         </li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value>           <p base="SL49513882" id="IAS12_P0152">with limited exceptions, an entity recognises the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination at their fair values at the acquisition date.                          When a liability assumed is recognised at the acquisition date but the related costs are not deducted in determining taxable profits until a later period, a deductible temporary difference arises which results in a deferred tax asset. A deferred tax asset also arises when the fair value of an identifiable asset acquired is less than its tax base. In both cases, the resulting deferred tax asset affects goodwill (see <xref base="SL49513885" href="IAS12_66.dita#IAS12_66" id="IAS12_X0183">paragraph 66</xref>); and</p>         </li><li><li_value>(d)</li_value>           <p base="SL49513887" id="IAS12_P0153">certain assets may be carried at fair value, or may be revalued, without an equivalent adjustment being made for tax purposes (see <xref base="F49513888" href="IAS12_g20-20.dita#IAS12_g20-20" id="IAS12_X0184">paragraph 20</xref>).
