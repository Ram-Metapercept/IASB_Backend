However, economic benefits in the form of reductions in tax payments will flow to the entity only if it earns sufficient taxable profits against which the deductions can be offset. Therefore, an entity recognises deferred tax assets only when it is probable  that taxable profits will be available  against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.</p></body></paragraph>
