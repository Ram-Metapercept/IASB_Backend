The issue related to the economic benefit available in the form of reductions in future contributions when there is a minimum funding requirement. IFRIC 14 requires the economic benefit to be determined assuming a stable workforce in the future unless the entity is demonstrably committed at the end of the reporting period to make a reduction in the number of employees covered by the plan. The request noted that in some circumstances the assumption of a stable workforce may understate the economic benefits available to the entity as a reduction in future contributions. The request noted that contributions to a plan are recognised as an expense, not an asset, if they provide no economic benefits in accordance with IFRIC 14. Therefore, by choosing the timing and the level of such contributions, an entity can affect its reported earnings.</p>       <p>The IFRIC noted that the requirements of IFRIC 14 regarding the assumption of a stable workforce are explicit. The issue was discussed extensively during the development of IFRIC 14 and the request provided no new information to cause the IFRIC to reconsider its conclusion. The IFRIC therefore decided not to add this issue to its agenda.]</p>       </fn><fn base="IFRIC14_21" id="IFRIC14_FN0002">       <p outputclass="keep_with_next" id="IFRIC14_P0281">[IFRIC® <i>Update</i>, July 2015, Agenda Decision, ‘IFRIC 14 <i>IAS 19—The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction</i>: Should an entity assume continuation of a minimum funding requirement for contributions relating to future service?’</p>       <p>The Interpretations Committee received a request to clarify whether the future minimum funding requirement for contributions to a defined benefit plan to cover future service would apply for only the fixed period that had been agreed between the entity and the pension trustees. The conclusion on this issue could affect how the economic benefit available as a reduction in future contributions is determined, which could in turn affect the amount of the net defined benefit liability or asset to be recognised in the entity’s statement of financial position.</p>       <p outputclass="keep_with_next">In the circumstances described by the submitter, neither a plan wind-up nor a plan closure to future accrual has been decided upon at the end of the reporting period.

Accordingly, when the entity estimates the future minimum funding requirement contributions, it should (i) include the amounts in the schedule of contributions for the fixed period specified by the schedule; and (ii) beyond that period, make an estimate that assumes a continuation of those factors establishing the minimum funding basis as determined by the pension trustees. This is because:</p>           <ol outputclass="static" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>a.</li_value>         <p id="IFRIC14_P0296">paragraphs 21 and BC30 of IFRIC 14 explain that an entity's estimate of future minimum funding requirement contributions shall not include the effect of expected changes in the terms and conditions of the minimum funding basis that are not substantively enacted or contractually agreed at the end of the reporting period; and</p>         </li><li><li_value>b.</li_value>         <p id="IFRIC14_P0297">in the circumstances described, those factors establishing the minimum funding basis that are determined by the pension trustees and recorded in the statement of funding principles are equivalent to a legal requirement or contractual agreement. Accordingly, the estimate of future minimum funding requirement contributions for future service should not assume any changes to those factors if such changes require future negotiations with the pension trustees.</p>         </li></ol>          <p id="IFRIC14_P0298">The Interpretations Committee further noted that, for any factors affecting the estimation of future minimum funding requirements that are not determined by the trustees (for example, the remaining life of the plan is not specified by the existing funding principles), the assumptions used to estimate future minimum funding requirement contributions for future service beyond the fixed period must be consistent with those used for determining future service costs. This is because paragraphs 17 and 21 of IFRIC 14 require an entity to use assumptions that are consistent with those used to determine the defined benefit obligation and with the situation that exists at the end of the reporting period.</p>       <p>On the basis of this analysis, the Interpretations Committee determined that, in the light of the existing IFRS requirements, sufficient guidance exists and that neither an Interpretation nor an amendment to a Standard was necessary and therefore decided not to add this issue to its agenda.]</p>       </fn></bodydiv></body></topic>
