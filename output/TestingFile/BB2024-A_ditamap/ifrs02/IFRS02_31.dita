Alternatively, an entity might grant to its employees a right to receive a future cash payment by granting to them a right to shares (including shares to be issued upon the exercise of share options) that are redeemable, either mandatorily (for example, upon cessation of employment) or at the employee’s option. These arrangements are examples of cash-settled share-based payment transactions. Share appreciation rights are used to illustrate some of the requirements in <xref base="F51887646" href="IFRS02_32.dita#IFRS02_32" id="IFRS02_X0193">paragraphs 32–33D</xref>; however, the requirements in those paragraphs apply to all cash-settled share-based payment transactions.</p>     </variant></body></paragraph>
