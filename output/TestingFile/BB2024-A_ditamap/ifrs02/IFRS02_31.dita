Alternatively, an entity might grant to its employees a right to receive a future cash payment by granting to them a right to shares (including shares to be issued upon the exercise of&#xa0;share options) that are redeemable, either mandatorily (for example,&#xa0;upon cessation of employment) or at the employee&#x2019;s option. These arrangements are examples of&#xa0;cash-settled share-based payment transactions.
