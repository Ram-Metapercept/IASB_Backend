This applies irrespective of any modifications to the terms and conditions on which the equity instruments were granted, or a cancellation or settlement of that grant of equity instruments.  In addition, the entity shall recognise the effects of modifications that increase the total fair value of the share&#x2011;based payment arrangement or are otherwise beneficial to the employee. Guidance on applying this requirement is given in <xref id="IFRS02_X0182" base="F752618" href="IFRS02_APPB.dita#IFRS02_APPB/IFRS02_APPB_TI">Appendix&#xa0;B</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
