Goods includes inventories, consumables,             property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and other non&#x2011;financial assets.              However, an entity shall not apply this             IFRS to transactions in which the entity acquires goods as part of the net assets             acquired in a business combination as defined by <xref base="F7283568" href="../ifrs03/IFRS03_2.dita#IFRS03_2" id="IFRS02_X0085">IFRS&#xa0;3 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Business                         Combinations</ph></ph></xref> (as revised in 2008), in a combination of entities or             businesses under common control as described in <xref base="F9042958" href="../ifrs03/IFRS03_gB1-B4.dita#IFRS03_gB1-B4" id="IFRS02_X0086">paragraphs B1&#x2013;B4                 of IFRS&#xa0;3</xref>, or the contribution of a business on the formation of a joint             venture as defined by <xref base="F16219570" href="../ifrs11/IFRS11_TOC.dita#IFRS11_TOC0001" id="IFRS02_X0087">IFRS&#xa0;11 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Joint                         Arrangements</ph></ph></xref>.             Hence, equity                     instruments issued in a business combination in exchange for control of the             acquiree are not within the scope of this IFRS. However, equity instruments granted to             employees of the acquiree in their capacity as employees (eg in return for continued             service) are within the scope of this IFRS. Similarly, the cancellation, replacement or             other modification  of <i>share&#x2011;based payment                         arrangements</i> because of a business combination or other equity             restructuring shall be accounted for in accordance with this IFRS. <xref base="F5312386" href="../ifrs03/IFRS03_TOC.dita#IFRS03_TOC0001" id="IFRS02_X0090">IFRS&#xa0;3</xref>             provides guidance on determining whether equity instruments issued in a business             combination are part of the consideration transferred in exchange for control of the             acquiree (and therefore within the scope of <xref base="F5312388" href="../ifrs03/IFRS03_TOC.dita#IFRS03_TOC0001" id="IFRS02_X0091">IFRS&#xa0;3</xref>) or             are in return for continued service to be recognised in the post&#x2011;combination period (and             therefore within the scope of this IFRS). </p></body></paragraph>
