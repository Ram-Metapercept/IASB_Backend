For example, many employee options have long lives, are usually exercisable during the period between vesting date and the end of the options&#x2019; life, and are often exercised early. These factors should be considered when estimating the grant date fair value of the options. For many entities, this might preclude the use of the Black&#x2011;Scholes&#x2011;Merton formula, which does not allow for the possibility of exercise before the end of the option&#x2019;s life and may not adequately reflect the effects of expected early exercise. It also does not allow for the possibility that expected volatility and other model inputs  might vary over the option&#x2019;s life. However, for share options with relatively short contractual lives, or that must be exercised within a short period of time after vesting date, the factors identified above may not apply. In these instances, the Black&#x2011;Scholes&#x2011;Merton formula may produce a value that is substantially the same as a more flexible option pricing model.</p></body></paragraph>
