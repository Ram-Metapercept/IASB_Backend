For example, a grant of shares or&#xa0;share options&#xa0;to an employee is typically conditional on the employee remaining in the entity&#x2019;s employ for a specified period of time. There might be&#xa0;performance conditions&#xa0;that must be satisfied, such as the entity achieving a specified growth in profit or a specified increase in the entity&#x2019;s share price. Vesting conditions, other than&#xa0;market conditions, shall not be taken into account when estimating the fair value of the shares or share options at the&#xa0;measurement date. Instead, vesting conditions, other than market conditions, shall be taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments included in the measurement of the transaction amount so that, ultimately, the amount recognised for goods or services received as consideration for the&#xa0;equity instruments granted&#xa0;shall be based on the number of equity instruments that eventually&#xa0;vest. Hence, on a cumulative basis, no amount is recognised for goods or services received if the equity instruments granted do not vest because of failure to satisfy a&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">vesting condition</ph></ph>, other than a market condition, for example, the counterparty fails to complete a specified service period, or a performance condition is not satisfied, subject to the requirements of&#xa0;<xref base="F49843307" href="IFRS02_21.dita#IFRS02_21" id="IFRS02_X0153">paragraph 21</xref>.                </p>     </variant></body></paragraph>
