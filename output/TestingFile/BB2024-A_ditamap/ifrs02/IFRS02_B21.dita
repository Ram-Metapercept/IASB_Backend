For example, the experience of an entity that grants options broadly to all levels of employees might indicate that top‑level executives tend to hold their options longer than middle‑management employees hold theirs and that lower‑level employees tend to exercise their options earlier than any other group. In addition, employees who are encouraged or required to hold a minimum amount of their employer’s equity instruments, including options, might on average exercise options later than employees not subject to that provision. In those situations, separating options by groups of recipients with relatively homogeneous exercise behaviour will result in a more accurate estimate of the total fair value of the share options granted.</p></body></paragraph>
