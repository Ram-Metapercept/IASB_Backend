For example, to say that a share with an expected continuously compounded rate of return of 12 per cent has a volatility of 30 per cent means that the probability that the rate of return on the share for one year will be between –18 per cent (12% – 30%) and 42 per cent (12% + 30%) is approximately two‑thirds. If the share price is CU100 at the beginning of the year and no dividends are paid, the year‑end share price would be expected to be between CU83.53 (CU100 × e<sup>–0.18</sup>) and CU152.20 (CU100 × e<sup>0.42</sup>) approximately two‑thirds of the time.</p></body></paragraph>
