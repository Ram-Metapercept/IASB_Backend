For example, it might reduce the exercise price of options granted to employees (ie reprice the options), which increases the fair value of those options.  The requirements in <xref id="IFRS02_X0179" base="F2-162" href="IFRS02_27.dita#IFRS02_27">paragraphs 27&#x2013;29</xref> to account for the effects of modifications are expressed in the context of share&#x2011;based payment transactions with employees. However, the requirements shall also be applied to share&#x2011;based payment transactions with parties other than employees that are measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted. In the latter case, any references in <xref id="IFRS02_X0180" base="F2-163" href="IFRS02_27.dita#IFRS02_27">paragraphs 27&#x2013;29</xref> to grant date shall instead refer to the date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders service.</p></body></paragraph>
