Therefore, the subsidiary shall account for the transaction with its employees as equity‑settled,  and recognise a corresponding increase in equity as a contribution from its parent. The subsidiary shall remeasure the cost of the transaction subsequently for any changes resulting from non‑market vesting conditions not being met in accordance with <xref id="IFRS02_X0413" base="F9048478" href="IFRS02_g19-21.dita#IFRS02_g19-21">paragraphs 19–21</xref>. This differs from the measurement of the transaction as cash‑settled in the consolidated financial statements of the group.</p></body></paragraph>
