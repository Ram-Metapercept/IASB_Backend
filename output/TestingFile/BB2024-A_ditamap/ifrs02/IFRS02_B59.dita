For example, a parent might grant rights to its equity instruments to the employees of its subsidiaries, conditional upon the completion of continuing service with the group for a specified period. An employee of one subsidiary might transfer employment to another subsidiary during the specified vesting period without the employee&#x2019;s rights to equity instruments of the parent under the original share&#x2011;based payment arrangement being affected. If the subsidiaries have no obligation to settle the share&#x2011;based payment transaction with their employees, they account for it as an equity&#x2011;settled transaction.  Each subsidiary shall measure the services received from the employee by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date the rights to those equity instruments were originally granted by the parent as defined in <xref id="IFRS02_X0417" base="F9048530" href="IFRS02_APPA.dita#IFRS02_APPA/IFRS02_APPA_TI">Appendix&#xa0;A</xref>, and the proportion of the vesting period the employee served with each subsidiary.</p></body></paragraph>
