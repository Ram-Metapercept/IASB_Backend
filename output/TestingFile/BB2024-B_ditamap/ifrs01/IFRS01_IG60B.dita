If, at the date of transition to IFRSs, the hedged forecast transaction is not highly probable, but is expected to occur, the entire deferred gain or loss is recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity. Any net cumulative gain or loss that has been reclassified to the cash flow hedge reserve on initial application of <xref base="F68305816" href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_TOC.dita#IFRS09_TOC0001" id="IFRS01_X1369">IFRS&#xa0;9</xref> remains there until (a) the forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, (b) the forecast transaction affects profit or loss or (c) subsequently circumstances change and the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, in which case any related net cumulative gain or loss is reclassified from the cash flow hedge reserve to profit or loss. If the hedging instrument is still held, but the hedge does not qualify as a cash flow hedge in accordance with IFRS&#xa0;9, hedge accounting is no longer appropriate starting from the date of transition to IFRSs.</p></body></paragraph>
