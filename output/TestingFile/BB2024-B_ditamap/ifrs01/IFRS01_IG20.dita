Such actuarial assumptions do not reflect conditions that arose after the date of transition to IFRSs. In particular, discount rates and the fair value of plan assets at the date of transition to IFRSs reflect market conditions at that date. Similarly, the entity’s actuarial assumptions at the date of transition to IFRSs about future employee turnover rates do not reflect a significant increase in estimated employee turnover rates as a result of a curtailment of the pension plan that occurred after the date of transition to IFRSs (<xref id="IFRS01_X1124" base="F15827692" href="IFRS01_16.dita#IFRS01_16">paragraph 16</xref> of the IFRS).</p></body></paragraph>
