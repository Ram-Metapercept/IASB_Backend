However, in some cases, an entity’s depreciation methods and rates in accordance with previous GAAP may differ from those that would be acceptable in accordance with IFRSs (for example, if they were adopted solely for tax purposes and do not reflect a reasonable estimate of the asset’s useful life). If those differences have a material effect on the financial statements, the entity adjusts accumulated depreciation in its opening IFRS statement of financial position retrospectively so that it complies with IFRSs. </p></body></paragraph>
