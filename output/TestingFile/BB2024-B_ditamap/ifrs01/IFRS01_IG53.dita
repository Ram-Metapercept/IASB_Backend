For example, an entity that does not apply paragraph B3 does not recognise assets transferred in a securitisation, transfer or other derecognition transaction that occurred before the date of transition to IFRSs if transactions qualified for derecognition in accordance with previous GAAP. However, if the entity uses the same securitisation arrangement or other derecognition arrangement for further transfers after the date of transition to IFRSs, those further transfers qualify for derecognition only if they meet the derecognition criteria of IFRS&#xa0;9.</p>     </variant></body></paragraph>
