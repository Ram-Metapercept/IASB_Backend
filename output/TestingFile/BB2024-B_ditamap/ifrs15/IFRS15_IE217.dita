The customer pays fixed consideration of CU100 per month plus a one-time variable consideration payment ranging from CU0–CU1,000 corresponding to a one-time regulatory review and certification of the customer’s facility (ie a performance bonus). The entity estimates that it will be entitled to CU750 of the variable consideration. On the basis of the entity’s assessment of the factors in <xref id="IFRS15_X1395" base="F33217995" href="IFRS15_57.dita#IFRS15_57">paragraph 57 of IFRS 15</xref>, the entity includes its estimate of CU750 of variable consideration in the transaction price because it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur. The entity measures its progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation using a time‑based measure.</p></body></paragraph>
