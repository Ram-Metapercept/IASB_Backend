Although the entity has subcontracted the manufacturing of the equipment to the supplier, the entity concludes that the design and manufacturing of the equipment are not distinct, because they are not separately identifiable (ie&#xa0;there is a single performance obligation). The entity is responsible for the overall management of the contract (for example, by ensuring that the manufacturing service conforms to the specifications) and, thus, provides a significant service of integrating those items into the combined output&#x2014;the specialised equipment&#x2014;for which the customer has contracted. In addition, those activities are highly interrelated. If necessary modifications to the specifications are identified as the equipment is manufactured, the entity is responsible for developing and communicating revisions to the supplier and for ensuring that any associated rework required conforms with the revised specifications. Accordingly, the entity identifies the specified good to be provided to the customer as the specialised equipment.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
