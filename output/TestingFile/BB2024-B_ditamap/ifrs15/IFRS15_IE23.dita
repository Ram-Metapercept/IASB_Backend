In accounting for the sale of the additional 30 products, the entity determines that the negotiated price of CU80 per product does not reflect the stand-alone selling price of the additional products. Consequently, the contract modification does not meet the conditions in <xref id="IFRS15_X1152" base="F33216762" href="IFRS15_20.dita#IFRS15_20">paragraph 20 of IFRS 15</xref> to be accounted for as a separate contract. Because the remaining products to be delivered are distinct from those already transferred, the entity applies the requirements in <xref id="IFRS15_X1153" base="F33216763" href="IFRS15_21.dita#IFRS15_21">paragraph 21(a) of IFRS 15</xref> and accounts for the modification as a termination of the original contract and the creation of a new contract.</p></body></paragraph>
