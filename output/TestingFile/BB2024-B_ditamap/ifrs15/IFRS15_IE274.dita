The upfront fee is, in effect, an advance payment for the future transaction processing services. Consequently, the entity determines the transaction price, which includes the non-refundable upfront fee, and recognises revenue for the transaction processing services as those services are provided in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X1459" base="F33218685" href="IFRS15_B49.dita#IFRS15_B49">paragraph B49 of IFRS 15</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
