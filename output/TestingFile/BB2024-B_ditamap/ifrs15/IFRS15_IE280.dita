On the basis of this conclusion, the entity applies <xref id="IFRS15_X1490" base="F49541485" href="IFRS15_31.dita#IFRS15_31">paragraphs 31&#x2013;38 of IFRS&#xa0;15</xref> to determine whether single the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over time. The entity concludes that because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the entity&#x2019;s performance as it occurs, the performance obligation is satisfied over time in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X1491" base="F49541486" href="IFRS15_35.dita#IFRS15_35">paragraph 35(a) of IFRS&#xa0;15</xref>.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
