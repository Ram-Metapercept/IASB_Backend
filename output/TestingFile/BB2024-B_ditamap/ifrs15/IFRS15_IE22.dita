However, the customer discovers that the initial 60 products transferred to the customer contained minor defects that were unique to those delivered products. The entity promises a partial credit of CU15 per product to compensate the customer for the poor quality of those products. The entity and the customer agree to incorporate the credit of CU900 (CU15 credit × 60 products) into the price that the entity charges for the additional 30 products. Consequently, the contract modification specifies that the price of the additional 30 products is CU1,500 or CU50 per product. That price comprises the agreed-upon price for the additional 30 products of CU2,400, or CU80 per product, less the credit of CU900.</p></body></paragraph>
