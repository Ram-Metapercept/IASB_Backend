The product and the maintenance services are not inputs to a combined item in the contract. The entity is not providing a significant integration service because the presence of the product and the services together in this contract do not result in any additional or combined functionality. In addition, neither the product nor the services modify or customise the other. Lastly, the product and the maintenance services are not highly interdependent or highly interrelated because the entity would be able to fulfil each of the promises in the contract independently of its efforts to fulfil the other (ie&#xa0;the entity would be able to transfer the product even if the customer declined maintenance services and would be able to provide maintenance services in relation to products sold previously through other distributors). The entity also observes, in applying the principle in paragraph&#xa0;29 of IFRS&#xa0;15, that the entity&#x2019;s promise to provide maintenance is not necessary for the product to continue to provide significant benefit to the customer. Consequently, the entity allocates a portion of the transaction price to each of the two performance obligations (ie&#xa0;the product and the maintenance services) in the contract.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
