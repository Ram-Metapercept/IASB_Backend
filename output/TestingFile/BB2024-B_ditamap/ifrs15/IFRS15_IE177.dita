Consequently, the application of the residual approach would result in a stand-alone selling price of CU5 for Product D (CU105 transaction price less CU100 allocated to Products A, B and C). The entity concludes that CU5 would not faithfully depict the amount of consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying its performance obligation to transfer Product D, because CU5 does not approximate the stand-alone selling price of Product D, which ranges from CU15–CU45. Consequently, the entity reviews its observable data, including sales and margin reports, to estimate the stand-alone selling price of Product D using another suitable method. The entity allocates the transaction price of CU105 to Products A, B, C and D using the relative stand-alone selling prices of those products in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X1359" base="F39221763" href="IFRS15_73.dita#IFRS15_73">paragraphs 73–80 of IFRS 15</xref>.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
