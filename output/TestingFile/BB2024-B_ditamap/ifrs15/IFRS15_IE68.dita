The performance obligation is satisfied over time in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X1238" base="F33217038" href="IFRS15_35.dita#IFRS15_35">paragraph 35(a) of IFRS&#xa0;15</xref> because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the entity&#x2019;s performance in processing each payroll transaction as and when each transaction is processed. The fact that another entity would not need to re&#x2011;perform payroll processing services for the service that the entity has provided to date also demonstrates that the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the entity&#x2019;s performance as the entity performs. (The entity disregards any practical limitations on transferring the remaining performance obligation, including setup activities that would need to be undertaken by another entity.) The entity recognises revenue over time by measuring its progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X1239" base="F33217069" href="IFRS15_39.dita#IFRS15_39">paragraphs 39&#x2013;45</xref> and <xref id="IFRS15_X1240" base="F33217070" href="IFRS15_B14.dita#IFRS15_B14">B14&#x2013;B19</xref> of IFRS&#xa0;15.</p></body></paragraph>
