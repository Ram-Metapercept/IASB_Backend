The entity assesses whether the costs incurred to procure the elevators are proportionate to the entity’s progress in satisfying the performance obligation, in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X1277" base="F33217305" href="IFRS15_B19.dita#IFRS15_B19">paragraph B19 of IFRS 15</xref>. The customer obtains control of the elevators when they are delivered to the site in December 20X2, although the elevators will not be installed until June 20X3. The costs to procure the elevators (CU1.5 million) are significant relative to the total expected costs to completely satisfy the performance obligation (CU4 million). The entity is not involved in designing or manufacturing the elevators.</p></body></paragraph>
