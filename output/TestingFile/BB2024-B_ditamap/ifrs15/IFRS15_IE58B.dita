The entity assesses the criteria in <xref id="IFRS15_X1206" base="F51966661" href="IFRS15_27.dita#IFRS15_27/IFRS15_27_V2">paragraph 27 of IFRS 15</xref> to determine whether each promised good or service is distinct. The entity determines that the equipment and the installation each meet the criterion in paragraph 27(a) of IFRS 15. The customer can benefit from the equipment on its own, by using it or reselling it for an amount greater than scrap value, or together with other readily available resources (for example, installation services available from alternative providers). The customer also can benefit from the installation services together with other resources that the customer will already have obtained from the entity (ie the equipment).</p></body></paragraph>
