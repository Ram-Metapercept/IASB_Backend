The contract also includes a promise to transfer Product D. Total consideration in the contract is CU130. The stand-alone selling price for Product D is highly variable (see <xref id="IFRS15_X1349" base="F33217724" href="IFRS15_79.dita#IFRS15_79">paragraph 79(c) of IFRS 15</xref>) because the entity sells Product D to different customers for a broad range of amounts (CU15–CU45). Consequently, the entity decides to estimate the stand-alone selling price of Product D using the residual approach.</p></body></paragraph>
