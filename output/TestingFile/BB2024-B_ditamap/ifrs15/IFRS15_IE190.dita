The entity also pays discretionary annual bonuses to sales supervisors based on annual sales targets, overall profitability of the entity and individual performance evaluations. In accordance with paragraph&#xa0;91 of IFRS&#xa0;15, the entity does not recognise an asset for the bonuses paid to sales supervisors because the bonuses are not incremental to obtaining a contract. The amounts are discretionary and are based on other factors, including the profitability of the entity and the individuals&#x2019; performance. The bonuses are not directly attributable to identifiable contracts.</p></body></paragraph>
