Consequently, in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X1542" base="F33218887" href="IFRS15_B66.dita#IFRS15_B66">paragraph B66(b) of IFRS 15</xref>, the entity accounts for the transaction as a financing arrangement, because the exercise price is more than the original selling price. In accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X1543" base="F33218888" href="IFRS15_B68.dita#IFRS15_B68">paragraph B68 of IFRS 15</xref>, the entity does not derecognise the asset and instead recognises the cash received as a financial liability. The entity also recognises interest expense for the difference between the exercise price (CU1.1 million) and the cash received (CU1 million), which increases the liability.</p></body></paragraph>
