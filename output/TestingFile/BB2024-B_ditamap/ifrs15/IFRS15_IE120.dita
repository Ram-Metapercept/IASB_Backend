The entity considers the factors in <xref id="IFRS15_X1299" base="F52069786" href="IFRS15_57.dita#IFRS15_57">paragraph&#xa0;57 of IFRS&#xa0;15</xref> and determines that it has significant previous experience with this product and current market information that supports its estimate. In addition, despite some uncertainty resulting from factors outside its influence, based on its current market estimates, the entity expects the price to be resolved within a short time frame. Thus, the entity concludes that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognised (ie&#xa0;CU80,000) will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved (ie&#xa0;when the total amount of price concessions is determined). Consequently, the entity recognises CU80,000 as revenue when the products are transferred on 1&#xa0;December 20X7.</p></body></paragraph>
