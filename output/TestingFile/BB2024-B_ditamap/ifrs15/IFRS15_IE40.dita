As a result, the fixed consideration and expected costs increase by CU150,000 and CU120,000, respectively. Total potential consideration after the modification is CU1,350,000 (CU1,150,000 fixed consideration + CU200,000 completion bonus). In addition, the allowable time for achieving the CU200,000 bonus is extended by 6&#xa0;months to 30 months from the original contract inception date. At the date of the modification, on the basis of its experience and the remaining work to be performed, which is primarily inside the building and not subject to weather conditions, the entity concludes that it is highly probable that including the bonus in the transaction price will not result in a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X1167" base="F33216805" href="IFRS15_56.dita#IFRS15_56">paragraph 56 of IFRS&#xa0;15</xref> and includes the CU200,000 in the transaction price. In assessing the contract modification, the entity evaluates <xref id="IFRS15_X1168" base="F33216806" href="IFRS15_27.dita#IFRS15_27">paragraph 27(b) of IFRS&#xa0;15</xref> and concludes (on the basis of the factors in <xref id="IFRS15_X1169" base="F33216833" href="IFRS15_29.dita#IFRS15_29">paragraph 29 of IFRS&#xa0;15</xref>) that the remaining goods and services to be provided using the modified contract are not distinct from the goods and services transferred on or before the date of contract modification; that is, the contract remains a single performance obligation.</p></body></paragraph>
