The entity does not have any contractual or implied obligations to change the licensed recording. The licensed recording has significant stand‑alone functionality (ie the ability to be played) and, therefore, the ability of the customer to obtain the benefits of the recording is not substantially derived from the entity’s ongoing activities. The entity therefore determines that the contract does not require, and the customer does not reasonably expect, the entity to undertake activities that significantly affect the licensed recording (ie the criterion in paragraph B58(a) is not met). Consequently, the entity concludes that the nature of its promise in transferring the licence is to provide the customer with a right to use the entity’s intellectual property as it exists at the point in time that it is granted. Therefore, the promise to grant the licence is a performance obligation satisfied at a point in time. The entity recognises all of the revenue at the point in time when the customer can direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the licensed intellectual property.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
