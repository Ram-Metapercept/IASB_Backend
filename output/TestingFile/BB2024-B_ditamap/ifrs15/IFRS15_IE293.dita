The entity concludes that the variable consideration (ie&#xa0;the sales-based royalty) should be allocated entirely to the franchise licence because the variable consideration relates entirely to the entity&#x2019;s promise to grant the franchise licence. In addition, the entity observes that allocating CU150,000 to the equipment and the sales-based royalty to the franchise licence would be consistent with an allocation based on the entity&#x2019;s relative stand-alone selling prices in similar contracts. Consequently, the entity concludes that the variable consideration (ie&#xa0;the sales-based royalty) should be allocated entirely to the performance obligation to grant the franchise licence.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
