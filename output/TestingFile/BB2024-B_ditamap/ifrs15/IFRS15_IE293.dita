The entity concludes that the variable consideration (ie the sales-based royalty) should be allocated entirely to the franchise licence because the variable consideration relates entirely to the entity’s promise to grant the franchise licence. In addition, the entity observes that allocating CU150,000 to the equipment and the sales-based royalty to the franchise licence would be consistent with an allocation based on the entity’s relative stand-alone selling prices in similar contracts. Consequently, the entity concludes that the variable consideration (ie the sales-based royalty) should be allocated entirely to the performance obligation to grant the franchise licence.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
