The contract requires Product&#xa0;A to be delivered first and states that payment for the delivery of Product&#xa0;A is conditional on the delivery of Product&#xa0;B. In other words, the consideration of CU1,000 is due only after the entity has transferred both Products&#xa0;A and B to the customer. Consequently, the entity does not have a right to consideration that is unconditional (a receivable) until both Products&#xa0;A and B are transferred to the customer.</p></body></paragraph>
