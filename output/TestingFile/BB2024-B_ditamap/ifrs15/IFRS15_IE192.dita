The contract is renewable for subsequent one-year periods. The average customer term is seven years. The entity pays an employee a CU10,000 sales commission upon the customer signing the contract. Before providing the services, the entity designs and builds a technology platform for the entity&#x2019;s internal use that interfaces with the customer&#x2019;s systems. That platform is not transferred to the customer, but will be used to deliver services to the customer.</p></body></paragraph>
