The entity considers the factors in <xref id="IFRS15_X1302" base="F52069788" href="IFRS15_57.dita#IFRS15_57">paragraph&#xa0;57 of IFRS&#xa0;15</xref> and observes that the amount of consideration is highly susceptible to factors outside the entity&#x2019;s influence (ie&#xa0;risk of obsolescence) and it is likely that the entity may be required to provide a broad range of price concessions to move the products through the distribution chain. Consequently, the entity cannot include its estimate of CU60,000 (ie&#xa0;a discount of 40 per cent) in the transaction price because it cannot conclude that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur. Although the entity&#x2019;s historical price concessions have ranged from 20&#x2013;60 per cent, market information currently suggests that a price concession of 15&#x2013;50 per cent will be necessary. The entity&#x2019;s actual results have been consistent with then-current market information in previous, similar transactions. Consequently, the entity concludes that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognised will not occur if the entity includes CU50,000 in the transaction price (CU100 sales price and a 50 per cent price concession) and therefore, recognises revenue at that amount. Therefore, the entity recognises revenue of CU50,000 when the products are transferred and reassesses the estimates of the transaction price at each reporting date until the uncertainty is resolved in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X1303" base="F33217387" href="IFRS15_59.dita#IFRS15_59">paragraph&#xa0;59 of IFRS&#xa0;15</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
