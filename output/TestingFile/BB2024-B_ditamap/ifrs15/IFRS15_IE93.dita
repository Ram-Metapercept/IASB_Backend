This is because the extent to which the customer uses the health clubs does not affect the amount of the remaining goods and services to which the customer is entitled. The entity concludes that the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the entity’s performance as it performs by making the health clubs available. Consequently, the entity’s performance obligation is satisfied over time in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X1275" base="F33217200" href="IFRS15_35.dita#IFRS15_35">paragraph 35(a) of IFRS 15</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
