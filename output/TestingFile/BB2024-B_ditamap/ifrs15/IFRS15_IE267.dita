Each point is redeemable for a CU1 discount on any future purchases of the entity&#x2019;s products. During a reporting period, customers purchase products for CU100,000 and earn 10,000 points that are redeemable for future purchases. The consideration is fixed and the stand-alone selling price of the purchased products is CU100,000. The entity expects 9,500 points to be redeemed. The entity estimates a stand-alone selling price of CU0.95 per point (totalling CU9,500) on the basis of the likelihood of redemption in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X1454" base="F33218654" href="IFRS15_B42.dita#IFRS15_B42">paragraph B42 of IFRS&#xa0;15</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
