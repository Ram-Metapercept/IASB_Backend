Because the benefit that the customer could obtain from the licence over the three&#x2011;year term without the updates would be significantly limited, the entity&#x2019;s promises to grant the licence and to provide the expected updates are, in effect, inputs that together fulfil a single promise to deliver a combined item to the customer. That is, the nature of the entity&#x2019;s promise in the contract is to provide ongoing access to the entity&#x2019;s intellectual property related to the design and production processes for a good for the three&#x2011;year term of the contract. The promises within that combined item (ie&#xa0;to grant the licence and to provide when&#x2011;and&#x2011;if&#x2011;available updates) are, therefore, not separately identifiable in accordance with the criterion in paragraph&#xa0;27(b) of IFRS&#xa0;15.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
