Because the benefit that the customer could obtain from the licence over the three‑year term without the updates would be significantly limited, the entity’s promises to grant the licence and to provide the expected updates are, in effect, inputs that together fulfil a single promise to deliver a combined item to the customer. That is, the nature of the entity’s promise in the contract is to provide ongoing access to the entity’s intellectual property related to the design and production processes for a good for the three‑year term of the contract. The promises within that combined item (ie to grant the licence and to provide when‑and‑if‑available updates) are, therefore, not separately identifiable in accordance with the criterion in paragraph 27(b) of IFRS 15.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
