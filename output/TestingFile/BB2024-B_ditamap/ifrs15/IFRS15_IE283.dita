The entity determines that the customer cannot benefit from the licence without the manufacturing service; therefore, the criterion in paragraph 27(a) of IFRS 15 is not met. Consequently, the licence and the manufacturing service are not distinct and the entity accounts for the licence and the manufacturing service as a single performance obligation.</p></body></paragraph>
