To estimate the variable consideration to which the entity will be entitled, the entity decides to use the expected value method (see <xref id="IFRS15_X1292" base="F33217352" href="IFRS15_53.dita#IFRS15_53">paragraph 53(a) of IFRS 15</xref>) because it is the method that the entity expects to better predict the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled. Using the expected value method, the entity estimates that 97 products will not be returned.</p></body></paragraph>
