The entity considers the factors in <xref id="IFRS15_X1294" base="F52069784" href="IFRS15_57.dita#IFRS15_57">paragraph&#xa0;57 of IFRS&#xa0;15</xref> and       determines that although the returns are outside the entity&#x2019;s influence, it has       significant experience in estimating returns for this product and customer class. In addition,       the uncertainty will be resolved within a short time frame (ie&#xa0;the 30&#x2011;day return period).       Thus, the entity concludes that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the       cumulative amount of revenue recognised (ie&#xa0;CU9,700) will not occur as the uncertainty is       resolved (ie&#xa0;over the return period).</p></body></paragraph>
