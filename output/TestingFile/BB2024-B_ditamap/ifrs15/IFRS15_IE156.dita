The contract is signed on 1 January 20X1 and work begins immediately. The entity concludes that the service is a single performance obligation in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X1333" base="F77678327" href="IFRS15_22.dita#IFRS15_22">paragraph 22(b) of IFRS 15</xref>. This is because the entity is providing a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer (the services transfer to the customer over time and use the same method to measure progress—that is, a time-based measure of progress).</p></body></paragraph>
