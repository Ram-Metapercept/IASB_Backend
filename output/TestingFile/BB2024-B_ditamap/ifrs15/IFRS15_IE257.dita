The terms of the contracts specify that at the end of the year, each customer has the option to renew the maintenance contract for a second year by paying an additional CU1,000. Customers who renew for a second year are also granted the option to renew for a third year for CU1,000. The entity charges significantly higher prices for maintenance services to customers that do not sign up for the maintenance services initially (ie when the products are new). That is, the entity charges CU3,000 in Year&#xa0;2 and CU5,000 in Year&#xa0;3 for annual maintenance services if a customer does not initially purchase the service or allows the service to lapse.</p></body></paragraph>
