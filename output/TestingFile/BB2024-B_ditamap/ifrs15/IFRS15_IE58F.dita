This is because the contractual requirement to use the entity&#x2019;s installation services does not change the characteristics of the goods or services themselves, nor does it change the entity&#x2019;s promises to the customer. Although the customer is required to use the entity&#x2019;s installation services, the equipment and the installation services are capable of being distinct (ie they each meet the criterion in <xref id="IFRS15_X1211" base="F51966706" href="IFRS15_27.dita#IFRS15_27/IFRS15_27_V2">paragraph&#xa0;27(a) of IFRS&#xa0;15)</xref> and the entity&#x2019;s promises to provide the equipment and to provide the installation services are each separately identifiable, ie they each meet the criterion in <xref id="IFRS15_X1212" base="F51966707" href="IFRS15_27.dita#IFRS15_27/IFRS15_27_V2">paragraph&#xa0;27(b) of IFRS&#xa0;15</xref>. The entity&#x2019;s analysis in this regard is consistent with that in Case&#xa0;C.</p></body></paragraph>
