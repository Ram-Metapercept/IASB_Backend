The entity determines that it does not have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date because, until construction of the unit is complete, the entity only has a right to the deposit paid by the customer. Because the entity does not have a right to payment for work completed to date, the entity’s performance obligation is not a performance obligation satisfied over time in accordance with paragraph 35(c) of IFRS 15. Instead, the entity accounts for the sale of the unit as a performance obligation satisfied at a point in time in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X1264" base="F33217158" href="IFRS15_38.dita#IFRS15_38">paragraph 38 of IFRS 15</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
