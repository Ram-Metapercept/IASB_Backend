The contract also specifies that the customer will obtain any updates to that intellectual property for new designs or production processes that may be developed by the entity. The updates are integral to the customer&#x2019;s ability to derive benefit from the licence during the licence period, because the intellectual property is used in an industry in which technologies change rapidly.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
