Product X transfers to the customer at contract inception and Product Y transfers on 31 March 20X1. The consideration promised by the customer includes fixed consideration of CU1,000 and variable consideration that is estimated to be CU200. The entity includes its estimate of variable consideration in the transaction price because it concludes that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. </p></body></paragraph>
