The consumables are readily available in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X1214" base="F51966664" href="IFRS15_28.dita#IFRS15_28">paragraph 28 of IFRS 15</xref>, because they are regularly sold separately by the entity (ie through refill orders to customers that previously purchased the equipment). The customer can benefit from the consumables that will be delivered under the contract together with the delivered equipment that is transferred to the customer initially under the contract. Therefore, the equipment and the consumables are each capable of being distinct in accordance with <xref id="IFRS15_X1215" base="F51966708" href="IFRS15_27.dita#IFRS15_27/IFRS15_27_V2">paragraph 27(a) of IFRS 15</xref>.</p></body></paragraph>
