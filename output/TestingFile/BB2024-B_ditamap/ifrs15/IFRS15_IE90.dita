The fact that the entity may choose to cancel the contract in the event the customer defaults on its obligations would not affect that assessment (see <xref id="IFRS15_X1271" base="F33217195" href="IFRS15_B11.dita#IFRS15_B11">paragraph B11 of IFRS&#xa0;15</xref>), provided that the entity&#x2019;s rights to require the customer to continue to perform as required under the contract (ie pay the promised consideration) are enforceable.</p></body></paragraph>
