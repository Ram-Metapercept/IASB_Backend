Although the contract does not preclude the entity from directing the completed satellite to another customer, the entity would incur significant costs to rework the design and function of the satellite to direct that asset to another customer. Consequently, the asset has no alternative use to the entity (see <xref id="IFRS15_X1252" base="F33217113" href="IFRS15_35.dita#IFRS15_35">paragraphs 35(c)</xref>, <xref id="IFRS15_X1253" base="F33217114" href="IFRS15_36.dita#IFRS15_36">36</xref> and <xref id="IFRS15_X1254" base="F33217116" href="IFRS15_B6.dita#IFRS15_B6">B6&#x2013;B8</xref> of IFRS&#xa0;15) because the customer-specific design of the satellite limits the entity&#x2019;s practical ability to readily direct the satellite to another customer.</p></body></paragraph>
