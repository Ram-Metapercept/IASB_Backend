For the consideration that is in the form of a sales-based royalty, <xref id="IFRS15_X1540" base="F49800568" href="IFRS15_B63.dita#IFRS15_B63">paragraph&#xa0;B63 of IFRS&#xa0;15</xref> applies because the sales&#x2011;based royalty relates solely to the licence, which is the only performance obligation in the contract. The entity concludes that recognition of the CU2 million fixed consideration as revenue rateably over time plus recognition of the royalty as revenue as and when the customer&#x2019;s sales of items using the team name or logo occur reasonably depicts the entity&#x2019;s progress towards complete satisfaction of the licence performance obligation.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
