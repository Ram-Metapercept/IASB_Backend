Reciting financial statement information without analysis, or presenting boilerplate discussions that do not provide insight into the entityâ€™s past performance or prospects, is unlikely to provide information that is useful to users of the financial reports and may create an obstacle for users to identify and understand the most significant matters facing the entity.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="PS1_P0070" base="F15644261">Management should also avoid generic disclosures that do not relate to the practices and circumstances of the entity and immaterial disclosures that make the more important information difficult to find.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
