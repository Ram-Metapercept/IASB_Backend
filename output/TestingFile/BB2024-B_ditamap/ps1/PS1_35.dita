Those explanations provide users of the financial reports with insight into the main trends and factors affecting the business. In providing those explanations, management should describe the relationship between the entity’s results, management’s objectives and management’s strategies for achieving those objectives. In addition, management should provide discussion and analysis of significant changes in financial position, liquidity and performance compared with those of the previous period or periods, as this can help users to understand the extent to which past performance may be indicative of future performance.</p></body></paragraph>
