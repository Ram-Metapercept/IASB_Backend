Disclosure about resources depends on the nature of the entity and on the industries in which the entity operates. Analysis of the adequacy of the entity&#x2019;s capital structure, financial arrangements (whether or not recognised in the statement of financial position), liquidity and cash flows, and human and intellectual capital resources, as well as plans to address any surplus resources or identified and expected inadequacies, are examples of disclosures that can provide useful information.</p></body></paragraph>
