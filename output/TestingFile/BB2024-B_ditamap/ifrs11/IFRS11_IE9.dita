The contractual arrangement between the parties establishes joint control of the activities that are conducted in entity X. The main feature of entity X’s legal form is that the entity, not the parties, has rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. These activities include the rental of the retail units, managing the car park, maintaining the centre and its equipment, such as lifts, and building the reputation and customer base for the centre as a whole.</p></body></paragraph>
