Consequently, in accordance with paragraph&#xa0;20, Company&#xa0;E recognises, and therefore measures, in relation to its interest in Joint Operation&#xa0;D, only its share in each of the assets that are jointly held and in each of the liabilities that are incurred jointly, as stated in the contractual arrangement. Company&#xa0;E does not include in its assets and liabilities the shares of the other parties in Joint Operation&#xa0;D.</p></body></paragraph>
