This is reinforced by the terms agreed by the parties in their contractual arrangement, which state that A and B have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement that is conducted through entity&#xa0;Z.  The joint arrangement is a joint operation. </p></body></paragraph>
