In addition, Company&#xa0;C seconds some of its employees who are experienced in processing Material&#xa0;M to Joint Operation&#xa0;Z. However, Company&#xa0;C does not transfer control of the know-how to Companies&#xa0;A and&#xa0;B or Joint Operation&#xa0;Z because it retains all the rights to it. In particular, Company&#xa0;C is entitled to withdraw the right to use its know-how in processing Material&#xa0;M and to withdraw its seconded employees without any restrictions or compensation to Companies&#xa0;A and&#xa0;B or Joint Operation&#xa0;Z if it ceases its participation in Joint Operation&#xa0;Z.</p></body></paragraph>
