After a firm purchase commitment is obtained, the buyer&#x2019;s inspection of the property identifies environmental damage not previously known to exist. The entity is required by the buyer to make good the damage, which will extend the period required to complete the sale beyond one year. However, the entity has initiated actions to make good the damage, and satisfactory rectification of the damage is highly probable. In that situation, the conditions in <xref base="F15831230" href="IFRS05_B1.dita#IFRS05_B1" id="IFRS05_X0303">paragraph B1(b)</xref> for an exception to the one&#x2011;year requirement in <xref base="F15831231" href="IFRS05_8.dita#IFRS05_8" id="IFRS05_X0304">paragraph 8</xref> would be met.</p></body></topic>
