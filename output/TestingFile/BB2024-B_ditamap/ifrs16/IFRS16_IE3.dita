Lessee uses eight different types of company car, which vary by price and are assigned to staff on the basis of seniority and territory. Lessee has a master lease agreement for each different type of company car. The individual leases within each master lease agreement are all similar (including similar start and end dates), but the terms and conditions generally vary from one master lease agreement to another. Because the individual leases within each master lease agreement are similar to each other, Lessee reasonably expects that applying the requirements of IFRS 16 to each master lease agreement would not result in a materially different effect than applying the requirements of IFRS 16 to each individual lease within the master lease agreement. Consequently, Lessee concludes that it can apply the requirements of IFRS 16 to each master lease agreement as a portfolio. In addition, Lessee concludes that two of the eight master lease agreements are similar and cover substantially similar types of company cars in similar territories. Lessee reasonably expects that the effect of applying IFRS 16 to the combined portfolio of leases within the two master lease agreements would not differ materially from applying IFRS 16 to each lease within that combined portfolio. Lessee, therefore, concludes that it can further combine those two master lease agreements into a single lease portfolio.</p>             </entry></row><row><entry colname="C1">               <p base="F45932509" id="IFRS16_P0839">Lessee’s trucks and vans are leased under individual lease agreements. There are 6,500 leases in total. All of the truck leases have similar terms, as do all of the van leases. The truck leases are generally for four years and involve similar models of truck. The van leases are generally for five years and involve similar models of van. Lessee reasonably expects that applying the requirements of IFRS 16 to portfolios of truck leases and van leases, grouped by type of underlying asset, territory and the quarter of the year within which the lease was entered into, would not result in a materially different effect from applying those requirements to each individual truck or van lease. Consequently, Lessee applies the requirements of IFRS 16 to different portfolios of truck and van leases, rather than to 6,500 individual leases.</p>             </entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></body></paragraph>
