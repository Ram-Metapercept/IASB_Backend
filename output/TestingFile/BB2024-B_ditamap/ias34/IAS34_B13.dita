Income taxes are assessed on an annual basis.       Interim period income tax expense is calculated by applying to an interim period’s       pre‑tax income the tax rate that would be applicable to expected total annual earnings,       that is, the estimated average annual effective income tax rate. That estimated average annual       rate would reflect a blend of the progressive tax rate structure expected to be applicable to       the full year’s earnings including enacted or substantively enacted changes in the       income tax rates scheduled to take effect later in the financial year. <xref id="IAS34_X0283" base="F16454051" href="../ias12/IAS12_TOC0001.dita#IAS12_TOC0001">IAS 12 <ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Income Taxes</ph></ph></xref>       provides guidance on substantively enacted changes in tax rates. The estimated average annual       income tax rate would be re‑estimated on a year‑to‑date basis, consistent       with <xref id="IAS34_X0284" base="F1220446" href="IAS34_28.dita#IAS34_28">paragraph 28</xref>       of the Standard.
