In principle, the dates of the transaction are each day in the period 1 September– 31 December 20X3. However, if exchange rates do not fluctuate significantly, Entity C may use a rate that approximates the actual rates as permitted by <xref id="IFRIC22_X0057" base="F60693717" href="../ias21/IAS21_22.dita#IAS21_22">paragraph 22 of IAS 21</xref>. If that is the case, Entity C may, for example, translate each month’s expense of FC100 (FC400 ÷ 4) into its functional currency using the average exchange rate for each month for the period 1 September–31 December 20X3.</p></body></paragraph>
