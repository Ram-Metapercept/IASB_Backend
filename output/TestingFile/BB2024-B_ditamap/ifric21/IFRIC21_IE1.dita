The generation of revenue in 20X0 is necessary, but not sufficient, to create a present obligation to pay a levy. Before 3 January 20X1, Entity B has no present obligation to pay a levy. In other words, the activity that triggers the payment of the levy, as identified by the legislation, is the point at which Entity B first generates revenue in 20X1. The generation of revenue in 20X0 is not the activity that triggers the payment of the levy and the recognition of the liability.
