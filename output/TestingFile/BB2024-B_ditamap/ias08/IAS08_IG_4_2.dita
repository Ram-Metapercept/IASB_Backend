Entity A has concluded that the resulting measurement is more       representative of the investment property&#x2019;s fair value in the circumstances existing at the       end of the current reporting period and, therefore, that IFRS 13 permits such a change. Entity       A has also concluded that the change in the valuation technique is not a correction of a prior       period error.</p></body></paragraph>
