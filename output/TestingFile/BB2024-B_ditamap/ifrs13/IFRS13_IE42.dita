Entity&#xa0;B determines that no adjustments are required to the quoted price of the asset. Accordingly, Entity&#xa0;B concludes that the fair value of its debt instrument at 31 December 20X1 is CU1,858,000. Entity&#xa0;B categorises and discloses the fair value measurement of its debt instrument within Level 1  of the fair value hierarchy.</p></body></paragraph>
