Entity X has a AA credit rating and can borrow at 6&#xa0;per cent, and Entity Y has a BBB credit rating and can borrow at 12&#xa0;per cent. Entity X will receive about CU374 in exchange for its promise (the present value of CU500 in five years at 6&#xa0;per cent). Entity Y will receive about CU284 in exchange for its promise (the present value of CU500 in five years at 12&#xa0;per cent). The fair value of the liability to each entity (ie the proceeds) incorporates that entity&#x2019;s credit standing.</p></body></paragraph>
