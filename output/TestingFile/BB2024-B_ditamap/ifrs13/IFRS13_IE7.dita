The land is currently developed for industrial use as a site for a factory. The current use of land is presumed to be its highest and best use unless market or other factors suggest a different use . Nearby sites have recently been developed for residential use as sites for high&#x2011;rise apartment buildings. On the basis of that development and recent zoning and other changes to facilitate that development, the entity determines that the land currently used as a site for a factory could be developed as a site for residential use (ie for high&#x2011;rise apartment buildings) because market participants would take into account the potential to develop the site for residential use when pricing the land. </p></body></paragraph>
