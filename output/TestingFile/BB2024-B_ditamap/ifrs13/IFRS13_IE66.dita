An entity might disclose the following about its residential mortgage‑backed securities to comply with paragraph 93(h)(i) of the IFRS:</p><lq> <p id="IFRS13_P2063" base="F16137719">The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the entity’s residential mortgage‑backed securities are prepayment rates, probability of default and loss severity in the event of default. Significant increases (decreases) in any of those inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Generally, a change in the assumption used for the probability of default is accompanied by a directionally similar change in the assumption used for the loss severity and a directionally opposite change in the assumption used for prepayment rates.</p></lq></body></paragraph>
