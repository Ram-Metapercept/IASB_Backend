Because Entity&#xa0;C&#x2019;s obligation is a financial liability, Entity&#xa0;C concludes that the interest rate already captures the risk or profit that a market participant would require as compensation for assuming the liability . Furthermore, Entity&#xa0;C does not adjust its present value technique for the existence of a restriction preventing it from transferring the liability. </p></body></paragraph>
