Market conditions, including available interest rates, credit spreads for a BBB‑quality credit rating and liquidity, remain unchanged from the date the debt instrument was issued. However, Entity C’s credit spread has deteriorated by 50 basis points because of a change in its risk of non‑performance . After taking into account all market conditions, Entity C concludes that if it was to issue the instrument at the measurement date, the instrument would bear a rate of interest of 10.5 per cent or Entity C would receive less than par in proceeds from the issue of the instrument.</p></body></paragraph>
