Market conditions, including available interest rates, credit spreads for a BBB&#x2011;quality credit rating and liquidity, remain unchanged from the date the debt instrument was issued. However, Entity&#xa0;C&#x2019;s credit spread has deteriorated by 50&#xa0;basis points because of a change in its risk of non&#x2011;performance . After taking into account all market conditions, Entity C concludes that if it was to issue the instrument at the measurement date, the instrument would bear a rate of interest of 10.5&#xa0;per cent or Entity&#xa0;C would receive less than par in proceeds from the issue of the instrument.</p></body></paragraph>
