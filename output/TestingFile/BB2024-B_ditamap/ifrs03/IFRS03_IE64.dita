The amount attributable to post‑combination service is CU10, which is the difference between the total value of the replacement awards (CU110) and the portion attributable to pre‑combination service (CU100).  Because no post‑combination service is required for the replacement awards, AC immediately recognises CU10 as remuneration cost in its post‑combination financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
