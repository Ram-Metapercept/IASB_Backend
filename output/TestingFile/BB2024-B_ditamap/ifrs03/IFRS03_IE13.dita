Therefore, the non‑controlling interest is 6.7 per cent. The non‑controlling interest reflects the proportionate interest of the non‑controlling shareholders in the pre‑combination carrying amounts of the net assets of Entity B, the legal subsidiary. Therefore, the consolidated statement of financial position is adjusted to show a non‑controlling interest of 6.7 per cent of the pre‑combination carrying amounts of Entity B’s net assets (ie CU134 or 6.7 per cent of CU2,000).</p></body></paragraph>
