The majority shareholders own 56 shares of Entity B. For that to represent a 58.3 per cent equity interest, Entity B would have had to issue an additional 40 shares. The majority shareholders would then own 56 of the 96 issued shares of Entity B and, therefore, 58.3 per cent of the combined entity. As a result, the fair value of the consideration transferred for Entity A, the accounting acquiree, is CU1,600 (ie 40 shares, each with a fair value of CU40). That is the same amount as when all 60 of Entity B’s shareholders tender all 60 of its ordinary shares for exchange. The recognised amount of the group’s interest in Entity A, the accounting acquiree, does not change if some of Entity B’s shareholders do not participate in the exchange.</p></body></paragraph>
