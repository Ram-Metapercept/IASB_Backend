The majority shareholders own 56 shares of Entity&#xa0;B. For that to represent a 58.3&#xa0;per cent equity interest, Entity&#xa0;B would have had to issue an additional 40 shares. The majority shareholders would then own 56 of the 96 issued shares of Entity&#xa0;B and, therefore, 58.3&#xa0;per cent of the combined entity. As a result, the fair value of the consideration transferred for Entity&#xa0;A, the accounting acquiree, is CU1,600 (ie 40 shares, each with a fair value of CU40). That is the same amount as when all 60 of Entity&#xa0;B&#x2019;s shareholders tender all 60 of its ordinary shares for exchange. The recognised amount of the group&#x2019;s interest in Entity&#xa0;A, the accounting acquiree, does not change if some of Entity&#xa0;B&#x2019;s shareholders do not participate in the exchange.</p></body></paragraph>
