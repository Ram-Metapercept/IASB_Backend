The set does not include an organised workforce and,       therefore, does not meet the criterion in <xref href="IFRS03_B12C.dita">paragraph B12C(a</xref>). However, Purchaser       concludes that the acquired manufacturing processes are substantive because,       when applied to acquired inputs, such as the intellectual property, raw material       supply contracts and specialised equipment, those processes significantly       contribute to the ability to continue producing outputs and because they are       unique to Product X. Consequently, the criterion in <xref href="IFRS03_B12C.dita">paragraph B12C(b)</xref> is met.       Furthermore, Purchaser concludes that the criterion in <xref href="IFRS03_B8.dita">paragraph B8</xref> is met       because those substantive processes and inputs together significantly contribute       to the ability to create output. As a result, Purchaser concludes that the       acquired set of activities and assets is a business.</p></body></paragraph>
