Consequently,       Purchaser applies the criteria in paragraph B12B. The set includes an organised       workforce that has the necessary skills, knowledge or experience to use the       equipment, but it does not include another acquired input (such as intellectual       property or inventories) that the organised workforce could develop or convert       into outputs. The facility and the equipment cannot be developed or converted       into outputs. Consequently, Purchaser concludes that the acquired set of       activities and assets is not a business.</p></body></paragraph>
