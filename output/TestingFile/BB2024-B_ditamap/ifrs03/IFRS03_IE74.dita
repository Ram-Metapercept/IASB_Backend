The fair value of the consideration paid is equal to the       aggregate fair value of the 10 single-family homes acquired. Each single-family       home includes the land, building and property improvements. Each home has a       different floor area and interior design. The 10 single-family homes are located       in the same area and the classes of customers (eg tenants) are similar. The risks       associated with operating in the real estate market of the homes acquired are       not significantly different. No employees, other assets, processes or other       activities are transferred.</p></body></paragraph>
