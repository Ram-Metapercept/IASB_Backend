Suppose that IFRSs had required AC to recognise a CU6&#xa0;million liability for the supply contract before the business combination. In that situation, AC recognises a CU1&#xa0;million settlement gain on the contract in profit or loss at the acquisition date (the CU5&#xa0;million measured loss on the contract less the CU6&#xa0;million loss previously recognised). In other words, AC has in effect settled a recognised liability of CU6&#xa0;million for CU5&#xa0;million, resulting in a gain of CU1&#xa0;million.</p></body></paragraph>
