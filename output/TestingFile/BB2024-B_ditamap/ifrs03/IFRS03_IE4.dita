The remaining 40&#xa0;per cent are owned by Entity&#xa0;A&#x2019;s shareholders. If the business combination had taken the form of Entity&#xa0;B issuing additional ordinary shares to Entity&#xa0;A&#x2019;s shareholders in exchange for their ordinary shares in Entity&#xa0;A, Entity&#xa0;B would have had to issue 40 shares for the ratio of ownership interest in the combined entity to be the same. Entity&#xa0;B&#x2019;s shareholders would then own 60 of the 100 issued shares of Entity B&#x2014;60&#xa0;per cent of the combined entity. As a result, the fair value of the consideration effectively transferred by Entity&#xa0;B and the group&#x2019;s interest in Entity&#xa0;A is CU1,600 (40 shares with a fair value per share of CU40).</p></body></paragraph>
