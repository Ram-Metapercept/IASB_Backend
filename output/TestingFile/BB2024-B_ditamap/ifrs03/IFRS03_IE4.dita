The remaining 40 per cent are owned by Entity A’s shareholders. If the business combination had taken the form of Entity B issuing additional ordinary shares to Entity A’s shareholders in exchange for their ordinary shares in Entity A, Entity B would have had to issue 40 shares for the ratio of ownership interest in the combined entity to be the same. Entity B’s shareholders would then own 60 of the 100 issued shares of Entity B—60 per cent of the combined entity. As a result, the fair value of the consideration effectively transferred by Entity B and the group’s interest in Entity A is CU1,600 (40 shares with a fair value per share of CU40).</p></body></paragraph>
