Thus, CU50 (CU100 × 2/4 years) is attributable to pre‑combination service and therefore included in the consideration transferred for the acquiree.  The remaining CU50 is attributable to post‑combination service. Because no post‑combination service is required to vest in the replacement award, AC recognises the entire CU50 immediately as remuneration cost in the post‑combination financial statements. </p></body></paragraph>
