Thus, CU50 (CU100 &#xd7; 2/4 years) is attributable to pre&#x2011;combination service and therefore included in the consideration transferred for the acquiree.  The remaining CU50 is attributable to post&#x2011;combination service. Because no post&#x2011;combination service is required to vest in the replacement award, AC recognises the entire CU50 immediately as remuneration cost in the post&#x2011;combination financial statements. </p></body></paragraph>
