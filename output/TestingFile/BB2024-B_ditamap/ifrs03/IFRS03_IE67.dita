Thus, CU80 (CU100 &#xd7; 4/5 years) is attributed to the pre&#x2011;combination vesting period and therefore included in the consideration transferred in the business combination.  The remaining CU20 is attributed to the post&#x2011;combination vesting period and is therefore recognised as remuneration cost in AC&#x2019;s post&#x2011;combination financial statements in accordance with IFRS&#xa0;2. </p></body></paragraph>
