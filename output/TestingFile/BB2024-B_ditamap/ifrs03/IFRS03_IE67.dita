Thus, CU80 (CU100 × 4/5 years) is attributed to the pre‑combination vesting period and therefore included in the consideration transferred in the business combination.  The remaining CU20 is attributed to the post‑combination vesting period and is therefore recognised as remuneration cost in AC’s post‑combination financial statements in accordance with IFRS 2. </p></body></paragraph>
