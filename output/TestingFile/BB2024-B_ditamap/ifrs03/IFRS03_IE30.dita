TC has a five&#x2011;year agreement to supply goods to Customer. Both TC and AC believe that Customer will renew the agreement at the end of the current contract. The agreement is not separable.</p> <p id="IFRS03_P0905" base="F4299076">The agreement, whether cancellable or not, meets the contractual&#x2011;legal criterion.

TC&#xa0;manufactures goods in two distinct lines of business: sporting goods and electronics. Customer purchases both sporting goods and electronics from TC. TC has a contract with Customer to be its exclusive provider of sporting goods but has no contract for the supply of electronics to Customer. Both TC and AC believe that only one overall customer relationship exists between TC and Customer.</p> <p id="IFRS03_P0907" base="F4299080">The contract to be Customer&#x2019;s exclusive supplier of sporting goods, whether cancellable or not, meets the contractual&#x2011;legal criterion. Additionally, because TC establishes its relationship with Customer through a contract, the customer relationship with Customer meets the contractual&#x2011;legal criterion. Because TC has only one customer relationship with Customer, the fair value of that relationship incorporates assumptions about TC&#x2019;s relationship with Customer related to both sporting goods and electronics. However, if AC determines that the customer relationships with Customer for sporting goods and for electronics are separate from each other, AC would assess whether the customer relationship for electronics meets the separability criterion for identification as an intangible asset.</p></li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value> <p id="IFRS03_P0908" base="F4299081">AC acquires TC in a business combination on 31&#xa0;December 20X5. TC&#xa0;does business with its customers solely through purchase and sales orders. At 31&#xa0;December 20X5, TC has a backlog of customer purchase orders from 60&#xa0;per cent of its customers, all of whom are recurring customers. The other 40&#xa0;per cent of TC&#x2019;s customers are also recurring customers. However, as of 31 December 20X5, TC has no open purchase orders or other contracts with those customers.</p> <p id="IFRS03_P0909" base="F4299082">Regardless of whether they are cancellable or not, the purchase orders from 60&#xa0;per cent of TC&#x2019;s customers meet the contractual&#x2011;legal criterion. Additionally, because TC has established its relationship with 60&#xa0;per cent of its customers through contracts, not only the purchase orders but also TC&#x2019;s customer relationships meet the contractual&#x2011;legal criterion. Because TC has a practice of establishing contracts with the remaining 40&#xa0;per cent of its customers, its relationship with those customers also arises through contractual rights and therefore meets the contractual&#x2011;legal criterion even though TC does not have contracts with those customers at 31&#xa0;December 20X5.</p></li><li><li_value>(d)</li_value> <p id="IFRS03_P0910" base="F4299084">AC acquires TC, an insurer, in a business combination on 31&#xa0;December 20X5.
