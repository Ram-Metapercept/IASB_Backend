The terms of the replaced TC awards did not eliminate any remaining vesting period upon a change in control. (If the TC awards had included a provision that eliminated any remaining vesting period upon a change in control, the guidance in Example 1 would apply.) The market‑based measure of both awards is CU100. Because employees have already rendered two years of service and the replacement awards do not require any post‑combination service, the total vesting period is two years.</p></body></paragraph>
