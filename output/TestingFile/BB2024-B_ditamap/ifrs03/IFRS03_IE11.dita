Because Entity&#xa0;A issues 2.5 shares in exchange for each       ordinary share of Entity&#xa0;B, Entity&#xa0;A issues only 140 (rather than 150) shares. As a result,       Entity&#xa0;B&#x2019;s shareholders own 58.3&#xa0;per cent of the issued shares of the combined entity       (140 of 240 issued shares). The fair value of the consideration transferred for Entity&#xa0;A, the       accounting acquiree, is calculated by assuming that the combination had been effected by       Entity&#xa0;B issuing additional ordinary shares to the shareholders of Entity&#xa0;A in exchange for       their ordinary shares in Entity&#xa0;A. That is because Entity&#xa0;B is the accounting acquirer, and         <xref id="IFRS03_X0594" base="F16123334" href="IFRS03_gB20-B20.dita#IFRS03_gB20-B20">paragraph B20 of IFRS&#xa0;3</xref> requires the acquirer to measure the consideration exchanged       for the accounting acquiree.</p></body></paragraph>
