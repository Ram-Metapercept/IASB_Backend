The additional set of activities and assets acquired includes the       land, buildings, leases and contracts for outsourced cleaning, security and       maintenance. No employees, other assets, other processes or other activities are       transferred. The aggregate fair value associated with the office park is similar to       the aggregate fair value associated with the 10 single-family homes. The       processes performed through the contracts for outsourced cleaning and security       are ancillary or minor within the context of all the processes required to create       outputs.</p></body></paragraph>
