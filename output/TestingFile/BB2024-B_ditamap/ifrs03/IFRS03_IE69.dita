Because employees have already rendered two years of service, the total vesting period is three years. The portion attributable to pre‑combination services equals the market‑based measure of the acquiree award (CU100) multiplied by the ratio of the pre‑combination vesting period (two years) to the <b>greater of</b> the total vesting period (three years) or the original vesting period of TC’s award (four years). Thus, CU50 (CU100 × 2/4 years) is attributable to pre‑combination service and therefore included in the consideration transferred for the acquiree.  The remaining CU50 is attributable to post‑combination service and therefore recognised as remuneration cost in AC’s post‑combination financial statements. </p></body></paragraph>
