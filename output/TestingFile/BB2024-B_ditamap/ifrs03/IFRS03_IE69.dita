Because employees have already rendered two years of service, the total vesting period is three years. The portion attributable to pre&#x2011;combination services equals the market&#x2011;based measure of the acquiree award (CU100) multiplied by the ratio of the pre&#x2011;combination vesting period (two years) to the <b>greater of</b> the total vesting period (three years) or the original vesting period of TC&#x2019;s award (four years). Thus, CU50 (CU100 &#xd7; 2/4 years) is attributable to pre&#x2011;combination service and therefore included in the consideration transferred for the acquiree.  The remaining CU50 is attributable to post&#x2011;combination service and therefore recognised as remuneration cost in AC&#x2019;s post&#x2011;combination financial statements. </p></body></paragraph>
