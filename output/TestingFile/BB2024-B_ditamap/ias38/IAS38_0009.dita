However, unexpected competition has recently entered the market and will reduce future sales of the product. Management estimates that net cash inflows generated by the product will be 20 per cent less for the foreseeable future. However, management expects that the product will continue to generate net cash inflows indefinitely at those reduced amounts.            </p><p id="IAS38_P0414" base="SL142096">As a result of the projected decrease in future net cash inflows, the entity determines that the estimated recoverable amount of the trademark is less than its carrying amount, and an impairment loss is recognised.              Because it is still regarded as having an indefinite useful life,              the trademark would continue not to be amortised but would be tested for impairment in accordance with <xref id="IAS38_X0492" base="F16456479" href="../ias36/IAS36_TOC0001.dita#IAS36_TOC0001">IAS&#xa0;36</xref> annually and whenever there is an indication that it may be impaired.            </p></body></topic>
