The acquiring entity intends to renew the trademark continuously and evidence supports its ability to do so. An analysis of (1) product life cycle studies, (2) market, competitive and environmental trends, and (3) brand extension opportunities provides evidence that the trademarked product will generate net cash inflows for the acquiring entity for an indefinite period.</p><p id="IAS38_P0412" base="SL142093">The trademark would be treated as having an indefinite useful life because it is expected to contribute to net cash inflows indefinitely. Therefore, the trademark would not be amortised until its useful life is determined to be finite.              It would be tested for impairment in accordance with <xref id="IAS38_X0486" base="F16456478" href="../ias36/IAS36_TOC0001.dita#IAS36_TOC0001">IAS&#xa0;36</xref> annually and whenever there is an indication that it may be impaired.            </p></body></topic>
