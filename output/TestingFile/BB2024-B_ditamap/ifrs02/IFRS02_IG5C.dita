For example, an entity might be required by government legislation to issue some portion of its shares to nationals of a particular country that may be transferred only to other nationals of that country. Such a transfer restriction may affect the fair value of the shares concerned, and therefore those shares may have a fair value that is less than the fair value of otherwise identical shares that do not carry such restrictions. In this situation, the phrase &#x2018;the fair value of the share&#x2011;based payment&#x2019; would refer to the fair value of the restricted shares, not the fair value of other, unrestricted shares.</p></body></paragraph>
