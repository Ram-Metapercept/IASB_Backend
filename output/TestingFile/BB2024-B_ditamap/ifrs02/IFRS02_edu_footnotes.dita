The issue           related to an employee benefit trust (or similar entity) that has been set up by a           sponsoring entity specifically to facilitate the transfer of its equity instruments to its           employees under a share&#x2011;based payment arrangement. The trust holds shares of the           sponsoring entity that are acquired by the trust from the sponsoring entity or from the           market. Acquisition of those shares is funded either by the sponsoring entity or by a bank           loan, usually guaranteed by the sponsoring entity. In most circumstances, the sponsoring           entity controls the employee benefit trust. In some circumstances, the sponsoring entity           may also have a direct control of the shares held by the trust. The issue is whether           guidance should be developed on the accounting treatment for the sponsor&#x2019;s equity           instruments held by the employee benefit trust in the sponsor&#x2019;s separate financial           statements.</p>         <p>The IFRIC discussed whether the employee benefit trust should be treated as an extension           of the sponsoring entity, such as a branch, or as a separate entity. The IFRIC noted that           the notion of &#x2018;entity&#x2019; is defined neither in the&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph>&#xa0;nor in&#xa0;<xref base="F77792700" href="../ias27/IAS27_TOC0001.dita#IAS27_TOC0001" id="IFRS02_X1055"><ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS&#xa0;27</ph>&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_title">Consolidated and Separate Financial               Statements</ph></ph></xref>. The IFRIC then discussed whether the sponsoring entity           should, in its separate financial statements, account for the net investment according           to&#xa0;IAS&#xa0;27&#xa0;or rather for the rights and obligations arising from the assets and liabilities           of the trust. The IFRIC noted that, in some circumstances, the sponsoring entity may have           direct control of the shares held by the trust. The IFRIC also noted that the guidance           included in the&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Framework</ph></ph>&#xa0;and&#xa0;IAS&#xa0;27&#xa0;does not address the accounting for the shares held by           the trust in the sponsor&#x2019;s separate financial statements.</p>         <p>The IFRIC concluded that it could not reach a consensus on this matter on a timely basis,           given the different types of trusts and trust arrangements that exist. The IFRIC noted           that this issue related to two active projects of the IASB: the&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Conceptual             Framework</ph></ph>&#xa0;and the revision of&#xa0;IAS&#xa0;27&#xa0;in the course of the Consolidation           project. For these reasons, the IFRIC decided not to add the issue to its agenda. (Since           this agenda decision, IAS&#xa0;27 has been amended and SIC&#x2011;12 was incorporated into           IFRS&#xa0;10.)]</p>       </fn><fn base="IFRS02_13A" id="IFRS02_FN0008">         <p id="IFRS02_P2554">[IFRIC&#xae;&#xa0;<i>Update</i>, July 2014, Agenda Decision, &#x2018;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS&#xa0;2</ph>&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_title">Share-based Payment</ph></ph>&#x2014;price difference between           the institutional offer price and the retail offer price for shares in an initial public           offering&#x2019;</p>         <p>The Interpretations Committee received a request to clarify how an entity should account           for a price difference between the institutional offer price and the retail offer price           for shares issued in an initial public offering (IPO).</p>         <p>The submitter refers to the fact that the final retail price could be different from the           institutional price because of:</p>         <ol outputclass="static" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>             <p>an unintentional difference arising from the book-building process; or</p>           </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>             <p>an intentional difference arising from a discount given to retail investors by the               issuer of the equity instruments as indicated in the prospectus.</p>           </li></ol>         <p>The submitter described a situation in which the issuer needs to fulfil a minimum number           of shareholders to qualify for a listing under the stock exchange&#x2019;s regulations in its           jurisdiction. In achieving this minimum number the issuer may offer shares to retail           investors at a discount from the price at which shares are sold to institutional           investors.</p>         <p>The submitter asked the Interpretations Committee to clarify whether the transaction           should be analysed within the scope of IFRS&#xa0;2.</p>         <p>The Interpretations Committee considered whether the transaction analysed involves the           receipt of identifiable or unidentifiable goods or services from the retail shareholder           group and, therefore, whether it is a share-based payment transaction within the scope of           IFRS&#xa0;2. Paragraph&#xa0;13A of IFRS&#xa0;2 requires that if consideration received by the entity           appears to be less than the fair value of the equity instruments granted or liability           incurred, then this situation typically indicates that other consideration (ie           unidentified goods or services) has been (or will be) received by the entity. The           Interpretations Committee noted that applying this guidance requires judgement and           consideration of the specific facts and circumstances of each transaction.</p>         <p>In the circumstances underlying the submission, the Interpretations Committee observed           that the entity issues shares at different prices to two different groups of investors           (retail and institutional) for the purpose of raising funds, and that the difference, if           any, between the retail price and the institutional price of the shares in the fact           pattern appears to relate to the existence of different markets (one that is accessible to           retail investors only and another one accessible to institutional investors only) instead           of the receipt of additional goods or services, because the only relationship between the           entity and the parties to whom the shares are issued is that of investee-investors.&#xa0;</p>         <p>Consequently, the Interpretations Committee observed that the guidance in IFRS&#xa0;2 is not           applicable because there is no share-based payment transaction.&#xa0;</p>         <p>The Interpretations Committee also noted that the situation considered is different to           the issue on which it had issued an agenda decision in March 2013 (&#x2018;Accounting for reverse           acquisitions that do not constitute a business&#x2019;). In that fact pattern the Interpretations           Committee observed that the accounting acquirer received a stock exchange listing from the           listed non-operating entity, which the listed non-operating entity had previously           possessed and was able to transfer to the accounting acquirer. In that agenda decision the           Interpretations Committee concluded that any difference in the fair value of the shares           deemed to have been issued by the accounting acquirer and the fair value of the accounting           acquiree&#x2019;s identifiable net assets represents a service received by the accounting           acquirer.&#xa0;</p>         <p>The Interpretations Committee observed that in the fact pattern considered in this           submission the listing is not received from the institutional or retail shareholders. It           further observed that the fair value of the shares issued to retail investors is different           from the fair value of the shares issued to institutional investors. The fact that a           regulatory requirement is met by virtue of issuing the retail shares does not indicate           that unidentifiable goods or services were received from the purchasers.&#xa0;</p>         <p>On the basis of this analysis, the Interpretations Committee determined that, in the           light of the existing IFRS requirements, sufficient guidance exists and that neither an           Interpretation nor an amendment to a Standard was necessary. Consequently, the           Interpretations Committee decided not to add this issue to its agenda.]</p>       </fn><fn base="IFRS02_18" id="IFRS02_FN0009">         <p id="IFRS02_P2555">[IFRIC&#xae;&#xa0;<i>Update</i>, November 2006, Agenda Decision, &#x2018;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS 2</ph>&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_title">Share-based Payment</ph></ph>&#x2014;Fair value measurement of           post&#x2011;vesting transfer restrictions&#x2019;</p>         <p>The IFRIC was asked whether the estimated value of shares issued only to employees and           subject to post&#x2011;vesting restrictions could be based on an approach that would look solely           or primarily to an actual or synthetic market that consisted only of transactions between           an entity and its employees and in which prices, for example, reflected an employee&#x2019;s           personal borrowing rate.

The obligation to settle these           awards is the parent&#x2019;s. The awards are based on the employee&#x2019;s service to the subsidiary.           The subsidiary and the parent both recognise the share-based transaction in accordance           with IFRS&#xa0;2&#x2014;typically over the vesting period of the awards. The parent has also entered           into recharge agreements with its subsidiaries that require the subsidiaries to pay the           parent the value of the share-based awards upon settlement of the awards by the           parent.</p>         <p>The submitter asked whether the subsidiary&#x2019;s liability to its parent in respect of these           charges should be recognised from the date of grant of the award or at the date of           exercise of the award.</p>         <p>Outreach conducted suggests that there is diversity in practice in the recognition of           these liabilities. Some respondents view the recharge and the share-based payments as           linked and recognise both from the date of grant over the vesting period. Others think           that the recharge is a separate transaction recognised by analogy with liabilities, the           distribution of equity or as an executory contract.</p>         <p>When discussing accounting for the intercompany recharge transaction, the Interpretations           Committee was concerned at the breadth of the topic. It thought that resolving this issue           would require it to address the accounting for intragroup payment arrangements generally           within the context of common control and that any conclusions drawn could have unintended           consequences on the treatment of other types of intercompany transactions.
