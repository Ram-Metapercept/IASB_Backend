For example, a transfer of shares held in treasury (own shares held) to another party is regarded as an &#x2018;issue&#x2019; of equity instruments. Some argue that if options or shares are granted with vesting conditions, they are not &#x2018;issued&#x2019; until those vesting conditions have been satisfied. However, even if this argument is accepted, it does not change the Board&#x2019;s conclusions on the requirements of the IFRS, and therefore the word &#x2018;issue&#x2019; is used broadly, to include situations in which equity instruments are conditionally transferred to the counterparty, subject to the satisfaction of specified vesting conditions.</p>       </fn><fn id="IFRS02_FN0030">       <p id="IFRS02_P2576">The G4+1 comprised members of the national accounting standard&#x2011;setting bodies of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the US, and IASC.</p>       </fn><fn id="IFRS02_FN0031">       <p id="IFRS02_P2577">Paragraphs BC18A&#x2013;BC18D are added as a consequence of&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Group Cash&#x2011;settled Share&#x2011;based Payment Transactions</ph></ph>&#xa0;(Amendments to IFRS&#xa0;2) issued in June 2009.</p>       </fn><fn id="IFRS02_FN0032">       <p id="IFRS02_P2578">In some cases, the reason for the transfer would explain why no goods or services have been or will be received.

The future economic benefits usually provided by an interest in shares are the right to receive dividends and the right to gain from an increase in value of the shares. When a company has an interest in its own shares, it will receive dividends on those shares only if it elects to pay them, and such dividends do not represent a gain to the company, as there is no change in net assets: the flow of funds is simply circular. Whilst it is true that a company that holds its own shares in treasury may sell them and receive a higher amount if their value has increased, a company is generally able to issue shares to third parties at (or near) the current market price. Although there may be legal, regulatory or administrative reasons why it is easier to sell shares that are held as treasury shares than it would be to issue new shares, such considerations do not seem to amount to a fundamental contrast between the two cases. (Footnote to paragraph 4.7)</p>       </fn><fn id="IFRS02_FN0046">       <p id="IFRS02_P2592">When the Board developed the proposals in ED&#xa0;2, it focused on the measurement of equity&#x2011;settled transactions with employees and with parties other than employees. ED&#xa0;2&#xa0;did not propose a definition of the term &#x2018;employees&#x2019;. When the Board reconsidered the proposals in ED&#xa0;2 in the light of comments received, it discussed whether the term might be interpreted too narrowly. This could result in a different accounting treatment of services received from individuals who are regarded as employees (eg for legal or tax purposes) and substantially similar services received from other individuals. The Board therefore concluded that the requirements of the IFRS for transactions with employees should also apply to transactions with other parties providing similar services. This includes services received from (1)&#xa0;individuals who work for the entity under its direction in the same way as individuals who are regarded as employees for legal or tax purposes and (2)&#xa0;individuals who are not employees but who render personal services to the entity similar to those rendered by employees. All references to employees therefore include other parties providing similar services.</p>       </fn><fn id="IFRS02_FN0047">       <p id="IFRS02_P2593">Service date measurement theoretically requires the entity to measure the fair value of the share option at each date when services are received. For pragmatic reasons, an approximation would probably be used, such as the fair value of the share option at the end of each accounting period, or the value of the share option measured at regular intervals during each accounting period.</p>       </fn><fn id="IFRS02_FN0048">       <p id="IFRS02_P2594">In August 2005 IAS&#xa0;32 was amended as&#xa0;<xref base="F15998598" href="../ias32/IAS32_TOC.dita#IAS32_TOC0001" id="IFRS02_X1081">IAS&#xa0;32&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Financial Instruments: Presentation.</ph></ph></xref>&#xa0;</p>       </fn><fn id="IFRS02_FN0049">       <p id="IFRS02_P2595">ED&#xa0;2 proposed that equity&#x2011;settled share&#x2011;based payment transactions should be measured at the fair value of the goods or services received, or by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted, whichever fair value is more readily determinable. For transactions with parties other than employees, ED&#xa0;2 proposed that there should be a rebuttable presumption that the fair value of the goods or services received is the more readily determinable fair value. The Board reconsidered these proposed requirements when finalising the IFRS. It concluded that it would be more consistent with the primary accounting objective (explained in&#xa0;<xref base="F15998675" href="IFRS02_BC64.dita#IFRS02_BC64" id="IFRS02_X1082">paragraphs BC64&#x2013;BC66</xref>) to require equity&#x2011;settled share&#x2011;based payment transactions to be measured at the fair value of the goods or services received, unless that fair value cannot be estimated reliably (eg&#xa0;in transactions with employees). For transactions with parties other than employees, the Board concluded that, in many cases, it should be possible to measure reliably the fair value of the goods or services received, as noted above. Hence, the Board concluded that the IFRS should require an entity to presume that the fair value of the goods or services received can be measured reliably.</p>       </fn><fn id="IFRS02_FN0050">       <p id="IFRS02_P2596">Paragraphs BC128A&#x2013;BC128H are added as a consequence of amendments to IFRS&#xa0;2&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Group Cash&#x2011;settled Share&#x2011;based Payment Transactions</ph></ph>&#xa0;issued in June 2009.</p>       </fn><fn id="IFRS02_FN0051">       <p id="IFRS02_P2597">P J Saly, R Jagannathan and S J Huddart. 1999.
