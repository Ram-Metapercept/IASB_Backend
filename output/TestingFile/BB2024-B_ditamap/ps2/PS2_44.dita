The entity makes this assessment by considering not only the size of the impact it recognises in its primary financial statements but also any unrecognised items that could ultimately affect primary users’ overall perception of the entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows (eg contingent liabilities or contingent assets). The entity needs to assess whether the impact is of such a size that information about the transaction, other event or condition could reasonably be expected to influence its primary users’ decisions about providing resources to the entity.</p></body></paragraph>
