This Standard defines the minimum content of an interim financial report as including condensed financial statements and selected explanatory notes. The interim financial report is intended to provide an update on the latest complete set of annual financial statements. Accordingly, it focuses on new activities, events, and circumstances and does not duplicate information previously reported.</p></lq>     </bodydiv><bodydiv base="F60793541" id="PS2_UN0039">       <p base="F60793538" id="PS2_P0474"><b><xref base="F65372732" href="../ias34/IAS34_15.dita#IAS34_15" id="PS2_X0234">Paragraph 15</xref></b></p>       <p base="F60793540" id="PS2_P0475">Referred to in <xref base="F65372733" href="PS2_87.dita#PS2_87" id="PS2_X0235">paragraph 87</xref> of the Practice Statement</p>     <lq>  <p id="PS2_P0476">An entity shall include in its interim financial report an explanation of events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in financial position and performance of the entity since the end of the last annual reporting period.
