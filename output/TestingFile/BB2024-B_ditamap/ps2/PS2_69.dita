Those local laws or regulations might require the entity to provide in the       financial statements prior‑period information in addition to the minimum comparative       information required by the Standards. The Standards permit the inclusion of such additional       information, but require that it is prepared in accordance with the Standards<xref keyref="footnotes/PS2_FN0048" type="fn"/> and does not obscure material information.<xref keyref="footnotes/PS2_FN0049" type="fn"/> However, an entity that wishes to state compliance       with IFRS Standards cannot provide less information than required by the Standards, even if       local laws and regulations permit otherwise. </p></body></paragraph>
