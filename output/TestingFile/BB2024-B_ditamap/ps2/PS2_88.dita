Measurements included in interim financial reports often rely more on estimates than measurements included in the annual financial statements.<xref keyref="footnotes/PS2_FN0059" type="fn"/> That fact does not, in itself, make the estimated measurements material. Nevertheless, relying on estimates for interim financial data to a greater extent than for annual financial data might result in more disclosures about such uncertainties being material, and thus being provided in the interim financial report, compared with the annual financial statements.</p></body></paragraph>
