Such             information may be material if, for example:<ol outputclass="static" type="lower-alpha"><li>                     <li_value>(a)</li_value>                     <p>users of the entity’s financial statements need that information to                         understand other material information provided in the financial statements.                         Such a scenario might arise when an entity applying <xref href="../ifrs09/IFRS09_TOC.dita#IFRS09_TOC0001"><ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IFRS                                     9</ph>                                 <ph outputclass="standard_title">Financial                             Instruments</ph></ph></xref> has no choice regarding the classification                         of its financial instruments. In such scenarios, users of that entity’s                         financial statements may only be able to understand how the entity has                         accounted for its material financial instruments if users also understand                         how the entity has applied the requirements of IFRS 9 to its financial                         instruments.</p>                 </li><li>                     <li_value>(b)</li_value>                     <p>an entity reports in a jurisdiction in which entities also report applying                         local accounting standards.</p>                 </li><li>                     <li_value>(c)</li_value>                     <p>the accounting required by the IFRS Standards is complex, and users of                         financial statements need to understand the required accounting. Such a                         scenario might arise when an entity accounts for a material class of                         transactions, other events or conditions by applying more than one IFRS                         Standard.</p>                 </li></ol>                      </p></body></paragraph>
