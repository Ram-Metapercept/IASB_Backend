Making materiality judgements about errors involves both quantitative and qualitative considerations. The entity identifies information that, if misstated or omitted, could reasonably be expected to influence primary usersâ€™ decisions (as described in <xref id="PS2_X0132" base="F74599452" href="PS2_g35-39.dita#PS2_g35-39/PS2_g35-39_TI">Step 1</xref> and <xref id="PS2_X0133" base="F74599453" href="PS2_g40-55.dita#PS2_g40-55/PS2_g40-55_TI">Step 2</xref> of the materiality process). The entity also considers whether any identified errors are material on a collective basis (as described in <xref id="PS2_X0134" base="F74599454" href="PS2_g60-65.dita#PS2_g60-65/PS2_g60-65_TI">Step 4</xref> of the materiality process).</p></body></paragraph>
