An entity makes this assessment in the same way it assesses other             information: by considering qualitative and quantitative factors, as described in <xref href="PS2_44.dita#PS2_44">paragraphs 44–55</xref>. Diagram 2 illustrates how an             entity assesses whether accounting policy information is material and, therefore, shall             be disclosed.</p><p outputclass="keep_with_next"><i>Diagram 2—determining whether accounting policy information is material</i></p><image href="graphics/PS2_88C_diagram2.png" otherprops="print" placement="inline"/></body></paragraph>
