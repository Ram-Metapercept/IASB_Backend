An external qualitative factor is a characteristic of the context in which the entity&#x2019;s transaction, other event or condition occur that, if present, makes information more likely to influence the primary users&#x2019; decisions. Characteristics of the entity&#x2019;s context that might represent external qualitative factors include, but are not limited to, the entity&#x2019;s geographical location, its industry sector, or the state of the economy or economies in which the entity operates.</p></body></paragraph>
