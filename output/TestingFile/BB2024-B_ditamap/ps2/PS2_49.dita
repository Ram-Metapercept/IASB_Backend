An external qualitative factor is a characteristic of the context in which the entity’s transaction, other event or condition occur that, if present, makes information more likely to influence the primary users’ decisions. Characteristics of the entity’s context that might represent external qualitative factors include, but are not limited to, the entity’s geographical location, its industry sector, or the state of the economy or economies in which the entity operates.</p></body></paragraph>
