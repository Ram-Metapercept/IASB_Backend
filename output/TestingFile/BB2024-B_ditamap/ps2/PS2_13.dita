Those primary users are existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors&#x2014;those users who cannot require entities to provide information directly to them and must rely on general purpose financial statements for much of the financial information they need.<xref keyref="footnotes/PS2_FN0015" type="fn"/> In addition to those primary users, other parties, such as the entity&#x2019;s management, regulators and members of the public, may be interested in financial information about the entity and may find the financial statements useful. However, the financial statements are not primarily directed at these other parties.<xref keyref="footnotes/PS2_FN0016" type="fn"/></p>  </variant></body></paragraph>
