M’s three reportable segments are Europe, North America and Asia. Goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to three individual cash‑generating units—two in Europe (units A and B) and one in North America (unit C)—and to one group of cash‑generating units (comprising operation XYZ) in Asia. Units A, B and C and operation XYZ each represent the lowest level within M at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.</p></body></paragraph>
