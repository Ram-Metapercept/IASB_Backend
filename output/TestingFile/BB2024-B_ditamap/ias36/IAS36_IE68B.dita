Therefore, Subsidiary is a cash&#x2011;generating unit. Because other cash&#x2011;generating units of Parent are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, the goodwill of CU500 related to those synergies has been allocated to other cash&#x2011;generating units within Parent. Because Subsidiary includes goodwill within its carrying amount, it must be tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if there is an indication that it might be impaired (see <xref id="IAS36_X0505" base="F16146140" href="IAS36_90.dita#IAS36_90">paragraph 90 of IAS&#xa0;36</xref>).</p></body></paragraph>
