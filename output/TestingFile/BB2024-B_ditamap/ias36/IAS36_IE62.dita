At that date, Subsidiary&#x2019;s net identifiable assets have a fair value of CU1,500. Parent chooses to measure the non&#x2011;controlling interests as the proportionate interest of Subsidiary&#x2019;s net identifiable assets of CU300 (20% of CU1,500). Goodwill of CU900 is the difference between the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount of the non&#x2011;controlling interests (CU2,100 + CU300) and the net identifiable assets (CU1,500).</p></body></paragraph>
