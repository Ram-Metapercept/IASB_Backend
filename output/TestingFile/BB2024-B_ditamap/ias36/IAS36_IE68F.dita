Therefore, rather than Subsidiary being the cash&#x2011;generating unit for the purposes of impairment testing, Subsidiary becomes part of a larger cash&#x2011;generating unit, Z. Other cash&#x2011;generating units of Parent are also expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Therefore, goodwill related to those synergies, in the amount of CU500, has been allocated to those other cash&#x2011;generating units. Z&#x2019;s goodwill related to previous business combinations is CU800.</p></body></paragraph>
