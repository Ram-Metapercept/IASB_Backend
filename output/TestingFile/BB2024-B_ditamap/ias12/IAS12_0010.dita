Changes in deferred tax that arise from items that are recognised in other comprehensive income are recognised in other comprehensive income (see paragraph 61A of the Standard).</p><p id="IAS12_P2450" base="F46911373">Entity Z did not recognise deferred tax assets for all of its deductible temporary differences at 31 December 20X1, and according to tax law all the tax deductions represented by the deductible temporary differences contribute equally to the tax loss for the period. Consequently, the assessment of the utilisation of deductible temporary differences does not specify whether the taxable profits are utilised for deferred tax items that are recognised in profit or loss (ie the deductible temporary differences from other sources) or whether instead the taxable profits are utilised for deferred tax items that are recognised in other comprehensive income (ie the deductible temporary differences related to debt instruments classified as fair value through other comprehensive income).</p><p id="IAS12_P2451" base="F46911374">For such situations, paragraph 63 of the Standard requires the changes in deferred taxes to be allocated to profit or loss and other comprehensive income on a reasonable pro rata basis or by another method that achieves a more appropriate allocation in the circumstances.</p></body></topic>
