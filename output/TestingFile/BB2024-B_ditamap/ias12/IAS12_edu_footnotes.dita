The IFRIC noted that IAS&#xa0;12 applies to income taxes, which are defined as taxes that are based on&#xa0;<i>taxable profit</i>. That implies that (i) not all taxes are within the scope of IAS&#xa0;12 but (ii) because taxable profit is not the same as accounting profit, taxes do not need to be based on a figure that is exactly accounting profit to be within the scope. The latter point is also implied by the requirement in IAS&#xa0;12 to disclose an explanation of the relationship between tax expense and accounting profit. The IFRIC further noted that the term &#x2018;taxable profit&#x2019; implies a notion of a net rather than a gross amount. Finally, the IFRIC observed that any taxes that are not in the scope of IAS 12 are in the scope of&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 37</ph>&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_title">Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets</ph></ph>.</p>       <p>However, the IFRIC also noted the variety of taxes that exist world-wide and the need for judgement in determining whether some taxes are income taxes. The IFRIC therefore believed that guidance beyond the observations noted above could not be developed in a reasonable period of time and decided not to take a project on this issue onto its agenda.]</p>       </fn><fn base="IAS12_2" id="IAS12_FN0002">       <p id="IAS12_P2560">[IFRIC&#xae;&#xa0;<i>Update</i>, May 2009, Agenda Decision, &#x2018;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 12</ph>&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_title">Income Taxes</ph></ph>&#x2014;Classification of tonnage taxes&#x2019;</p>       <p>The IFRIC received a request for guidance on whether a tax based on tonnage capacity can be considered an income tax in accordance with IAS&#xa0;12. The IFRIC noted that the term &#x2018;tonnage tax&#x2019; is applied to a variety of tax regimes. In some jurisdictions, shipping companies are permitted to choose to be taxed on the basis of tonnage transported, tonnage capacity or a notional profit instead of the standard corporate income tax regulations. In some jurisdictions, this choice is irrevocable.</p>       <p>The IFRIC has previously noted that IAS&#xa0;12 applies to income taxes, which are defined as taxes that are based on taxable profit, and that the term &#x2018;taxable profit&#x2019; implies a notion of a net rather than a gross amount. Taxes either on tonnage transported or tonnage capacity are based on gross rather than net amounts. Taxes on a notional income derived from tonnage capacity are not based on the entity&#x2019;s actual income and expenses.</p>       <p>Consequently, the IFRIC noted that such taxes would not be considered income taxes in accordance with IAS&#xa0;12 and would not be presented as part of tax expense in the statement of comprehensive income. However, the IFRIC also noted that, in accordance with paragraph 85 of&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS&#xa0;1</ph>&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_title">Presentation of Financial Statements</ph></ph>, an entity subject to tonnage tax would present additional subtotals in that statement if that presentation is relevant to an understanding of its financial performance.

On the basis of this assumption, the submitter asks the Committee to clarify whether the production-based royalty payments can be viewed as prepayment of the income tax payable. The Committee used the same assumption when discussing the issue.</p>       <p>The Committee observed that the line item of &#x2018;tax expense&#x2019; that is required by paragraph 82(d) of&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS&#xa0;1</ph>&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_title">Presentation of Financial Statements</ph></ph>&#xa0;is intended to require an entity to present taxes that meet the definition of income taxes under IAS&#xa0;12. The Committee also noted that it is the basis of calculation determined by the relevant tax rules that determines whether a tax meets the definition of an income tax. Neither the manner of settlement of a tax liability nor the factors relating to recipients of the tax is a determinant of whether an item meets that definition.</p>       <p>The Committee further noted that the production-based royalty payments should not be treated differently from other expenses that are outside the scope of IAS&#xa0;12, all of which may reduce income tax payable. Accordingly, the Committee observed that it is inappropriate to consider the royalty payments to be prepayment of the income tax payables. Because the production-based royalties are not income taxes, the royalty payments should not be presented as an income tax expense in the statement of comprehensive income.</p>       <p>The Committee considered that, in the light of its analysis of the existing requirements of IAS&#xa0;1 and IAS&#xa0;12, an interpretation was not necessary and consequently decided not to add this issue to its agenda.]</p>       </fn><fn base="IAS12_2" id="IAS12_FN0004">       <p id="IAS12_P2562">[IFRIC&#xae;&#xa0;<i>Update</i>, September 2017, Agenda Decision, &#x2018;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS&#xa0;12</ph>&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_title">Income Taxes</ph></ph>&#x2014;Interest and penalties related to income taxes&#x2019;</p>       <p>IFRS&#xa0;Standards do not specifically address the accounting for interest and penalties related to income taxes (interest and penalties). In the light of the feedback received on the draft IFRIC Interpretation&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_title">Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments</ph></ph>, the Committee considered whether to add a project on interest and penalties to its standard-setting agenda.</p>       <p>On the basis of its analysis, the Committee concluded that a project on interest and penalties would not result in an improvement in financial reporting that would be sufficient to outweigh the costs. Consequently, the Committee decided not to add a project on interest and penalties to its standard-setting agenda.</p>       <p>Nonetheless, the Committee observed that entities do not have an accounting policy choice between applying IAS&#xa0;12 and applying&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS&#xa0;37</ph>&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_title">Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets</ph></ph>&#xa0;to interest and penalties. Instead, if an entity considers a particular amount payable or receivable for interest and penalties to be an&#xa0;income tax, then the entity applies IAS&#xa0;12 to that amount. If an entity does not apply IAS&#xa0;12 to a particular amount payable or receivable for interest and penalties, it applies IAS&#xa0;37 to that amount. An entity discloses its judgement in this respect applying paragraph&#xa0;122 of&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS&#xa0;1</ph>&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_title">Presentation of Financial Statements</ph></ph>&#xa0;if it is part of the entity&#x2019;s judgements that had the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.</p>       <p id="IAS12_P2563">Paragraph&#xa0;79 of IAS&#xa0;12 requires an entity to disclose the major components of tax expense (income); for each class of provision, paragraphs 84&#x2013;85 of IAS&#xa0;37 require a reconciliation of the carrying amount at the beginning and end of the reporting period as well as other information. Accordingly, regardless of whether an entity applies IAS&#xa0;12 or IAS&#xa0;37 when accounting for interest and penalties, the entity discloses information about those interest and penalties if it is material.</p>       <p>The Committee also observed it had previously published agenda decisions discussing the scope of IAS&#xa0;12 in March 2006 and May&#xa0;2009.]</p>       </fn><fn base="IAS12_7" id="IAS12_FN0005">       <p id="IAS12_P2564">[IFRIC&#xae;&#xa0;<i>Update</i>, July 2012, Agenda Decision, &#x2018;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS&#xa0;12</ph>&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_title">Income Taxes</ph></ph>&#x2014;Accounting for market value uplifts on assets that are to be introduced by a new income tax regime&#x2019;</p>       <p>The IFRS Interpretations Committee received a request to clarify the accounting for market value uplifts introduced in a new income tax regime in a jurisdiction.</p>       <p>In calculating taxable profit under the tax regime, entities are permitted to calculate tax depreciation for certain mining assets using the market value of the assets as of a particular date as the &#x2018;starting base allowance&#x2019;, rather than the cost or carrying amount of the assets. If there is insufficient profit against which the annual tax depreciation can be used, it is carried forward and is able to be used as a deduction against taxable profit in future years.</p>       <p>The Committee noted that the starting base allowance, including the part that is attributable to the market value uplift, is attributed to the related assets under the tax regime and will become the basis for depreciation expense for tax purposes. Consequently, the market value uplift forms part of the related asset&#x2019;s &#x2018;tax base&#x2019;, as defined in paragraph&#xa0;5 of IAS&#xa0;12. The Committee observed that IAS&#xa0;12 requires an entity to reflect an adjustment to the tax base of an asset that is due to an increase in the deductions available as a deductible temporary difference. Accordingly, the Committee noted that a deferred tax asset should be recognised to the extent that it meets the recognition criteria in paragraph 24 of IAS&#xa0;12.</p>       <p>The Committee considered that, in the light of its analysis of the existing requirements of IAS&#xa0;12, an interpretation was not necessary and consequently decided not to add this issue to its agenda.]</p>       </fn><fn id="IAS12_FN0008">       <p id="IAS12_P2567">[IFRIC&#xae;&#xa0;<i>Update</i>, July 2014, Agenda Decision, &#x2018;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="stadnard_number">IAS&#xa0;12</ph>&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_title">Income Taxes</ph></ph>&#x2014;recognition of deferred tax for a single asset in a corporate wrapper&#x2019;</p>       <p>The Interpretations Committee received a request to clarify the accounting for deferred tax in the consolidated financial statements of the parent, when a subsidiary has only one asset within it (the asset inside) and the parent expects to recover the carrying amount of the asset inside by selling the shares in the subsidiary (the shares).</p>       <p outputclass="keep_with_next">The Interpretations Committee noted that:</p>       <ol outputclass="static" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>           <p id="IAS12_P2568">paragraph&#xa0;11 of IAS&#xa0;12 requires the entity to determine temporary differences in the consolidated financial statements by comparing the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements with the appropriate tax base.

This is because a non-depreciable asset has an unlimited (or infinite) life, and IAS&#xa0;38 explains that indefinite does not mean infinite. Consequently, the requirements in paragraph&#xa0;51B of IAS&#xa0;12 do not apply to intangible assets with an indefinite useful life.</p>       <p>The Interpretations Committee noted the Board&#x2019;s observation about intangible assets with indefinite useful lives when the Board amended IAS&#xa0;38 in 2004. The Board observed that an entity does not amortise an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life because there is no foreseeable limit on the period during which it expects to consume the future economic benefits embodied in the asset. Accordingly, amortisation over an arbitrarily determined maximum period would not be representationally faithful. The reason for non-amortisation of an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not because there is no consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset.</p>       <p>The Interpretations Committee observed that an entity recovers the carrying amount of an asset in the form of economic benefits that flow to the entity in future periods, which could be through use or sale of the asset. Accordingly, the recovery of the carrying amount of an asset does not depend on whether the asset is amortised. Consequently, the fact that an entity does not amortise an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life does not necessarily mean that the entity will recover the carrying amount of that asset only through sale and not through use.</p>       <p>The Interpretations Committee noted that an entity applies the principle and requirements in paragraphs&#xa0;51 and 51A of IAS&#xa0;12 when measuring deferred tax on an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life. In applying these paragraphs, an entity determines its expected manner of recovery of the carrying amount of the intangible asset with an indefinite useful life, and reflects the tax consequences that follow from that expected manner of recovery.</p>       <p outputclass="keep_with_next">The Interpretations Committee concluded that the principle and requirements in paragraphs&#xa0;51 and 51A of IAS&#xa0;12 provide sufficient requirements to enable an entity to measure deferred tax on intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.</p>       <p>In the light of existing requirements in IFRS Standards, the Interpretations Committee determined that neither an IFRIC Interpretation nor an amendment to a Standard was necessary.

The submitter asked how the tax rate should be selected when local tax legislation prescribes different tax rates for different manners of recovery (for example, dividends, sale, liquidation, etc). The submitter described a situation in which the carrying amount of an investment in an associate could be recovered by:</p>       <ol outputclass="static" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>           <p outputclass="keep_with_next" id="IAS12_P2607">receiving dividends (or other distribution of profit);</p>         </li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>           <p outputclass="keep_with_next" id="IAS12_P2608">sale to a third party; or</p>         </li><li><li_value>(c)</li_value>           <p outputclass="keep_with_next" id="IAS12_P2609">receiving residual assets upon liquidation of the associate.</p>         </li></ol>       <p id="IAS12_P2610">The submitter stated that an investor normally considers all of these variants of recovery. One part of the temporary difference will be received as dividends during the holding period, and another part will be recovered upon sale or liquidation.</p>       <p>The Interpretations Committee noted that paragraph&#xa0;51A of IAS&#xa0;12 states that an entity measures deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets using the tax rate and the tax base that are consistent with the expected manner of recovery or settlement. Accordingly, the tax rate should reflect the expected manner of recovery or settlement. If one part of the temporary difference is expected to be received as dividends, and another part is expected to be recovered upon sale or liquidation (for example, an investor has a plan to sell the investment later and expects to receive dividends until the sale of the investment), different tax rates would be applied to the parts of the temporary difference in order to be consistent with the expected manner of recovery.</p>       <p outputclass="keep_with_next">The Interpretations Committee observed that it had received no evidence of diversity in the application of IAS&#xa0;12 and that the Standard contains sufficient guidance to address the matters raised.

The Interpretations Committee observed that when changes in the exchange rate are the cause of a major component of the deferred tax charge or credit, an explanation of this in accordance with paragraph&#xa0;79 of IAS&#xa0;12 would help users of financial statements to understand the tax expense (income) for the period.</p>       <p>In the light of existing IFRS requirements, the Interpretations Committee determined that neither an Interpretation nor an amendment to a Standard was necessary.
