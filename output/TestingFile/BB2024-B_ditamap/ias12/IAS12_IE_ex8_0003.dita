The tax base of these components is nil because Lessee already received tax deductions for the advance lease payment and initial direct costs when it made those payments. The difference between the tax base (nil) and the carrying amount of each component results in taxable temporary differences of CU15 (related to the advance lease payment) and CU5 (related to the initial direct costs).</p><p>The exemption from recognising a deferred tax liability in paragraph 15 does not apply because the temporary differences arise from transactions that, at the time of the transactions, affect Lessee’s taxable profit (that is, the tax deductions Lessee received when it made the advance lease payment and paid initial direct costs reduced its taxable profit). Accordingly, Lessee recognises a deferred tax liability of CU3 (CU15 × 20%) and CU1 (CU5 × 20%) for the taxable temporary differences related to the advance lease payment and initial direct costs, respectively.</p></body></topic>
