Parent uses the step&#x2011;by&#x2011;step method of consolidation. Assume the hedge was fully effective and the full USD/EUR accumulated change in the value of the hedging instrument before disposal of Subsidiary&#xa0;C is &#x20ac;24&#xa0;million (gain). This is matched exactly by the fall in value of the net investment in Subsidiary&#xa0;C, when measured against the functional currency of Parent (euro).</p></body></paragraph>
