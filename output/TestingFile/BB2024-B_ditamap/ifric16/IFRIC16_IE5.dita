Using the step-by-step method, the amount to be reclassified to profit or loss in respect of the net investment in Subsidiary&#xa0;C would be only &#x20ac;11 million loss. Parent could adjust the foreign currency translation reserves of both Subsidiaries B and C by &#x20ac;13 million in order to match the amounts reclassified in respect of the hedging instrument and the net investment as would have been the case if the direct method of consolidation had been used, if that was its accounting policy. An entity that had not hedged its net investment could make the same reclassification.</p></variant></body></paragraph>
