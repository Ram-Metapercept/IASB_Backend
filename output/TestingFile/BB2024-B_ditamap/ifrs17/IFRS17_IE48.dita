However, if the right to death benefits provided by the insurance coverage either lapses or matures at the same time as the account balance, the insurance and investment components are highly interrelated and are therefore not distinct, applying <xref id="IFRS17_X1062" base="F59535155" href="IFRS17_B32.dita#IFRS17_B32">paragraph B32(b)</xref>. Consequently, the account balance would not be separated from the insurance contract and would be accounted for applying IFRS 17.</p></body></paragraph>
