Accordingly, on 1&#xa0;February 20X2 Entity A enters into a contract with Entity&#xa0;B that gives Entity&#xa0;B the right to receive and Entity&#xa0;A the obligation to pay the fair value of 1,000 of Entity&#xa0;A&#x2019;s own ordinary shares as of 31&#xa0;January 20X3 in exchange for CU102,000 in cash (ie CU102 per share) on 31&#xa0;January 20X3, if Entity&#xa0;B exercises that right. The contract will be settled net in cash. If Entity B does not exercise its right, no payment will be made. Entity&#xa0;A records the following journal entries.</p></body></paragraph>
