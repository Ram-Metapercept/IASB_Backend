It does not meet the definition of an equity instrument because it can be settled otherwise than by Entity&#xa0;A repurchasing a fixed number of its own shares in exchange for paying a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset. Entity&#xa0;A recognises a derivative asset or liability, as illustrated in (a) and (b) above. The accounting entry to be made on settlement depends on how the contract is actually settled.</p></body></paragraph>
