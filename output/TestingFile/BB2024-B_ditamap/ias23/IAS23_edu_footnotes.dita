The consideration promised by the customer in the contract is in the form of cash or another financial asset.&#xa0;</p>       </li></ol>     <p>The request asked whether the entity has a qualifying asset as defined in IAS 23 and, therefore, capitalises any directly attributable borrowing costs.</p>     <p>Applying paragraph 8 of IAS 23, an entity capitalises borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of that asset. Paragraph 5 of IAS 23 defines a qualifying asset as &#x2018;an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale&#x2019;.</p>     <p>Accordingly, the entity assesses whether, in the fact pattern described in the request, it recognises an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale. Depending on the particular facts and circumstances, the entity might recognise a receivable, a contract asset and/or inventory.</p>     <p outputclass="keep_with_next">The Committee concluded that, in the fact pattern described in the request:</p>     <ol outputclass="static"><li><li_value>a.</li_value>         <p>a receivable that the entity recognises is not a qualifying asset. Paragraph 7 of IAS 23 specifies that financial assets are not qualifying assets.&#xa0;</p>       </li><li><li_value>b.</li_value>         <p>a contract asset that the entity recognises is not a qualifying asset. The contract asset (as defined in Appendix A to IFRS 15) would represent the entity&#x2019;s right to consideration that is conditioned on something other than the passage of time in exchange for transferring control of a unit. The intended use of the contract asset&#x2014;to collect cash or another financial asset&#x2014;is not a use for which it necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready.&#xa0;</p>       </li><li><li_value>c.</li_value>         <p>inventory (work-in-progress) for unsold units under construction that the entity recognises is not a qualifying asset. In the fact pattern described in the request, this asset is ready for its intended sale in its current condition&#x2014;ie the entity intends to sell the part-constructed units as soon as it finds suitable customers and, on signing a contract with a customer, will transfer control of any work-in-progress relating to that unit to the customer.&#xa0;</p>       </li></ol>     <p>The Committee concluded that the principles and requirements in IAS 23 provide an adequate basis for an entity to determine whether to capitalise borrowing costs in the fact pattern described in the request. Consequently, the Committee decided not to add this matter to its standard-setting agenda.]</p></fn>       <fn base="IAS23_6" id="IAS23_FN0001">       <p outputclass="keep_with_next" id="IAS23_P0263">[IFRIC&#xae;&#xa0;<i>Update</i>, January 2008, Agenda Decision,&#xa0;&#x2018;<ph outputclass="standard_ref"><ph outputclass="standard_number">IAS 23</ph>&#xa0;<ph outputclass="standard_title">Borrowing Costs</ph></ph>&#xa0;(as revised in 2007)&#x2014;Foreign exchange and capitalisable borrowing costs&#x2019;&#xa0;</p>       <p>The IFRIC received a request for guidance on which foreign exchange differences may be regarded as adjustments to interest costs for the purpose of applying IAS&#xa0;23.

IAS&#xa0;23 paragraph 14 states that&#xa0;<i>&apos;To the extent that an entity borrows funds generally and uses them for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset</i>, the entity shall determine the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation by applying a capitalisation rate to the expenditures on that asset. The capitalisation rate shall be the weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to&#xa0;<i>the borrowings of the entity that are outstanding during the period, other than borrowings made specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset&apos;</i>&#xa0;(emphasis added). The request asked for guidance on the treatment of general borrowings used to purchase a specific asset other than a qualifying asset as defined in the standard.</p>       <p>The IFRIC noted that because paragraph&#xa0;14 of IAS&#xa0;23 refers only to qualifying assets, some conclude that borrowings related to specific assets other than qualifying assets cannot be excluded from determining the capitalisation rate for general borrowings. Others note the general principle in paragraph&#xa0;10 that the borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are borrowing costs that would have been avoided if the expenditure on the qualifying asset had not been made. The IFRIC noted that paragraph&#xa0;11 of IAS&#xa0;23 states &#x2018;the determination of the amount of borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of a qualifying asset is difficult and the exercise of judgement is required.&#x2019;</p>       <p>The IFRIC noted that the standard itself acknowledges that judgement will be required in its application. In addition, the IFRIC concluded that any guidance it could provide would be in the nature of application guidance rather than an interpretation. The IFRIC also noted that the Board would consider whether to add this issue to the annual improvements project. At its meeting in July 2009, the Board noted that IAS&#xa0;23 excludes only debt used to acquire qualifying assets from the determination of the capitalisation rate. The Board decided not to include this issue in the annual improvements project.</p>       <p>The IFRIC therefore decided not to add the issue to its agenda.]&#xa0;</p>       </fn></bodydiv></body></topic>
