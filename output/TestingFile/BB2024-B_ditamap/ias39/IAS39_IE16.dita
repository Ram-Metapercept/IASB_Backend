Entity&#xa0;A calculates that it has sold 8<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>&#xa0;per cent of the entire portfolio of assets. Because the assets were allocated into time periods by allocating a percentage of the assets (rather than individual assets) into each time period, Entity&#xa0;A determines that it cannot ascertain into which specific time periods the sold assets were scheduled. Hence it uses a systematic and rational basis of allocation. Based on the fact that it sold a representative selection of the assets in the portfolio, Entity&#xa0;A allocates the sale proportionately over all time periods.</p></body></paragraph>
