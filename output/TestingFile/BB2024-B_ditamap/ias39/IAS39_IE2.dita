The&#xa0;entity uses monthly time periods and schedules items for the next five years (ie&#xa0;it has 60 separate monthly time periods).<xref keyref="footnotes/IAS39_FN0046" type="fn"/> The assets in the portfolio are prepayable assets that Entity&#xa0;A allocates into time periods based on the expected prepayment dates, by allocating a percentage of all of the assets, rather than individual items, into each time period. The portfolio also includes demandable liabilities that the entity expects, on a portfolio basis, to repay between one month and five years and, for risk management purposes, are scheduled into time periods on this basis. On the basis of this analysis, Entity&#xa0;A decides what amount it wishes to hedge in each time period.</p></body></paragraph>
