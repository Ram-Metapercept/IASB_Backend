Legal proceedings are started seeking damages from the entity but it disputes liability. Up to the date of authorisation of the financial statements for the year to 31&#xa0;December 20X0 for issue, the entity&#x2019;s lawyers advise that it is probable that the entity will not be found liable. However, when the entity prepares the financial statements for the year to 31&#xa0;December 20X1, its lawyers advise that, owing to developments in the case, it is probable that the entity will be found liable.</p><ol outputclass="static" base="SL153489" id="IAS37_L0029" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value>         <p base="SL153491" id="IAS37_P0346">At 31&#xa0;December 20X0</p>       </li></ol><p base="SL153492" id="IAS37_P0347"><b>Present obligation as a result of a past obligating event</b> &#x2013; On the basis of the evidence available when the financial statements were approved, there is no obligation as a result of past events.</p><p base="SL153493" id="IAS37_P0348"><b>Conclusion</b> &#x2013; No provision is recognised (see <xref base="F16146565" href="IAS37_g15-16.dita#IAS37_g15-16" id="IAS37_X0280">paragraphs 15 and 16</xref>).
