Accordingly, at the reporting date, Entity B evaluates whether the bond is considered to have low credit risk using all reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort. In making that evaluation, Entity B reassesses the internal credit rating of the bond and concludes that the bond is no longer equivalent to an investment grade rating because:</p><ol outputclass="static" id="IFRS09_L0179" base="F32659193" type="lower-alpha"><li><li_value>(a)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P1811" base="F32659194">The latest quarterly report of Company A revealed a quarter-on-quarter decline in revenues of 20 per cent and in operating profit by 12 per cent.</p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P1812" base="F32659196">Rating agencies have reacted negatively to a profit warning by Company&#xa0;A and put the credit rating under review for possible downgrade from investment grade to non-investment grade.

Entity B assesses that the bond prices have been declining as a result of increases in Company A&#x2019;s credit risk. This is because the market environment has not changed (for example, benchmark interest rates, liquidity etc are unchanged) and comparison with the bond prices of peers shows that the reductions are probably company specific (instead of being, for example, changes in benchmark interest rates that are not indicative of company-specific credit risk).</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
