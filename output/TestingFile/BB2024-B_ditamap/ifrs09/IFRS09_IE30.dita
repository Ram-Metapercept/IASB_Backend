Loans with a credit score above the &#x2018;acceptance level&#x2019; are approved because these borrowers are considered to be able to meet contractual payment obligations. When new mortgage loans are originated, Bank ABC uses the credit score to determine the risk of a default occurring as at initial recognition.</p></body></paragraph>
