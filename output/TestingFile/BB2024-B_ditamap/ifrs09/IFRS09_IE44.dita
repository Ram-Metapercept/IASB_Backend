Although Bank A did not perform an individual assessment of changes in the credit risk on each loan since its initial recognition, assessing the credit risk on a counterparty level and recognising lifetime expected credit losses on all loans granted to Company Q, meets the objective of the impairment requirements as stated in <xref id="IFRS09_X1746" base="F43660387" href="IFRS09_5.5.4.dita#IFRS09_5.5.4">paragraph 5.5.4 of IFRS 9</xref>. This is because, even since the most recent loan was originated (in 20X7) when Company Q had the highest credit risk at loan origination, its credit risk has increased significantly. The counterparty assessment would therefore achieve the same result as assessing the change in credit risk for each loan individually.</p></body></paragraph>
