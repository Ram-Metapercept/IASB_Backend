Instead, for credit risk management purposes, Bank ABC tracks the risk of a default occurring by means of past due statuses. It recognises a loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses for all loans that have a past due status of more than 30 days past due. Although Bank ABC uses past due status information as the only borrower-specific information, it also considers other reasonable and supportable forward-looking information that is available without undue cost or effort to assess whether lifetime expected credit losses should be recognised on loans that are not more than 30 days past due. This is necessary in order to meet the objective in <xref id="IFRS09_X1735" base="F70814350" href="IFRS09_5.5.4.dita#IFRS09_5.5.4">paragraph 5.5.4 of IFRS&#xa0;9</xref> of recognising lifetime expected credit losses for all significant increases in credit risk.</p></body></paragraph>
