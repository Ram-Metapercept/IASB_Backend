Bank Z therefore needs to assess whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition in accordance with <xref id="IFRS09_X1721" base="F70814174" href="IFRS09_5_5_3.dita#IFRS09_5_5_3">paragraph 5.5.3 of IFRS&#xa0;9</xref>, irrespective of the value of the collateral it holds. It notes that the loan is subject to considerable credit risk at the reporting date because even a slight deterioration in cash flows could result in Company H missing a contractual payment on the loan. As a result, Bank Z determines that the credit risk (ie the risk of a default occurring) has increased significantly since initial recognition. Consequently, Bank Z recognises lifetime expected credit losses on the loan to Company H.</p></body></paragraph>
