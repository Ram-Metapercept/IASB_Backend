Bank X provides a tranche of that loan facility to Company Y. At the time of origination of the loan by Bank X, although Company&#xa0;Y&#x2019;s leverage was relatively high compared with other issuers with similar credit risk, it was expected that Company Y would be able to meet the covenants for the life of the instrument. In addition, the generation of revenue and cash flow was expected to be stable in Company Y&#x2019;s industry over the term of the senior facility. However, there was some business risk related to the ability to grow gross margins within its existing businesses.</p></body></paragraph>
