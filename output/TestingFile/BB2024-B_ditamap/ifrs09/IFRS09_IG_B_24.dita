The interest rate may be fixed or variable. Would the difference between the initial amount paid or received and zero (&#x2018;the maturity amount&#x2019;) be amortised immediately on initial recognition for the purpose of determining amortised cost if the rate of interest is fixed or specified as a market-based variable rate?</b></p><p id="IFRS09_P4827" base="F32868113">No. Since there are no repayment of the gross carrying amount, there is no amortisation of the difference between the initial amount and the maturity amount if the rate of interest is fixed or specified as a market-based variable rate. Because interest payments are fixed or market-based and will be paid in perpetuity, the amortised cost (the present value of the stream of future cash payments discounted at the effective interest rate) equals the gross carrying amount in each period.</p></body></topic>
