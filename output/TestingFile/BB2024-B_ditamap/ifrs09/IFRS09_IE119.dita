This hedging relationship is designated at the end of Period&#xa0;1 with a term to the end of Period&#xa0;5. Because of the basis spread between the price of the coffee that Entity A actually buys and the price for the benchmark coffee, Entity A designates a volume of 112,500&#xa0;pounds (lbs) of coffee as the hedging instrument and a volume of 118,421&#xa0;lbs as the hedged item.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS09_FN0055" type="fn"/></p></li><li><li_value>(b)</li_value>       <p id="IFRS09_P2453" base="SL32825203">An FX risk hedging relationship between the aggregated exposure as the hedged item and an FX forward contract as the hedging instrument (the &#x2018;second level relationship&#x2019;). This hedging relationship is designated at the end of Period&#xa0;2 with a term to the end of Period&#xa0;5. The aggregated exposure that is designated as the hedged item represents the FX risk that is the effect of exchange rate changes, compared to the forward FX rate at the end of Period&#xa0;2 (ie the time of designation of the FX risk hedging relationship), on the combined FX cash flows in FC of the two items designated in the commodity price risk hedging relationship, which are the forecast coffee purchase and the commodity forward contract. Entity A&#x2019;s long-term view of the basis spread between the price of the coffee that it actually buys and the price for the benchmark coffee has not changed from the end of Period&#xa0;1. Consequently, the actual volume of hedging instrument that Entity A enters into (the nominal amount of the FX forward contract of FC140,625) reflects the cash flow exposure associated with a basis spread that had remained at &#x2011;5 per cent. However, Entity A&#x2019;s actual aggregated exposure is affected by changes in the basis spread. Because the basis spread has moved from &#x2011;5 per cent to &#x2011;5.5 per cent during Period&#xa0;2, Entity A&#x2019;s actual aggregated exposure at the end of Period&#xa0;2 is FC140,027.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
