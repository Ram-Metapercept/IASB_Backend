The fixed and variable amounts are determined on the basis of a CU100 million notional amount. ABC and XYZ do not exchange the notional amount. ABC pays or receives a net cash amount each quarter based on the difference between 8&#xa0;per cent and three&#x2011;month LIBOR. Alternatively, settlement may be on a gross basis.</p><p base="F32868101" id="IFRS09_P4792">The contract meets the definition of a derivative regardless of whether there is net or gross settlement because its value changes in response to changes in an underlying variable (LIBOR), there is no initial net investment, and settlements occur at future dates.</p></body></topic>
