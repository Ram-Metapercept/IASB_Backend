For example, if cross-border transactions in natural gas in North America are routinely denominated in US&#xa0;dollars and such transactions are routinely denominated in euro in Europe, neither the US&#xa0;dollar nor the euro is a currency in which the goods or services are routinely denominated in commercial transactions around the world.</p></body></topic>
