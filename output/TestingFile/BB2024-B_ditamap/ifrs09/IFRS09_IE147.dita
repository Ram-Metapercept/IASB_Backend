However, the amount of the total interest expense is not equal to the amount of the variable rate interest because of the amortisation of the amount that was in the cash flow hedge reserve for the first level relationship at the end of Period 1.<xref keyref="footnotes/IFRS09_FN0082" type="fn"/></p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
