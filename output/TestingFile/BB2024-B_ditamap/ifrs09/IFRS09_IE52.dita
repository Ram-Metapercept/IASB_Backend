Entity B determines that it is appropriate to measure the loss allowance on a collective basis in accordance with IFRS&#xa0;9. The 12-month PD remains at 0.5 per cent at the reporting date. Entity B therefore measures the loss allowance on a collective basis at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses based on the average 0.5 per cent 12-month PD. Implicit in the calculation is the 99.5 per cent probability that there is no default. At the reporting date the loss allowance for the 12-month expected credit losses is CU1,250 (0.5% &#xd7; 25% &#xd7; CU1,000,000).</p></body></paragraph>
