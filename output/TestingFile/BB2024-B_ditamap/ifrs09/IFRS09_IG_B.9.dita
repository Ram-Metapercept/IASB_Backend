It prepays at inception based on the current price of the shares. Is the forward contract a derivative?</b></p><p base="F32868184" id="IFRS09_P4819">No. The forward contract fails the &#x2018;no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have a similar response to changes in market factors&#x2019; test for a derivative.</p><p base="F32868185" id="IFRS09_P4820">To illustrate: Entity XYZ enters into a forward contract to purchase 1 million T ordinary shares in one year. The current market price of T is CU50 per share; the one&#x2011;year forward price of T is CU55 per share. XYZ is required to prepay the forward contract at inception with a CU50 million payment. The initial investment in the forward contract of CU50&#xa0;million is less than the notional amount applied to the underlying, 1 million shares at the forward price of CU55 per share, ie CU55 million. However, the initial net investment approximates the investment that would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have a similar response to changes in market factors because T&#x2019;s shares could be purchased at inception for the same price of CU50. Accordingly, the prepaid forward contract does not meet the initial net investment criterion of a derivative instrument.</p></body></topic>
