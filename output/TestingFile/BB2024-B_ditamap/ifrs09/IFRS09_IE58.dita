The credit cards have a one-day notice period after which Bank A has the contractual right to cancel the credit card (both the drawn and undrawn components). However, Bank A does not enforce its contractual right to cancel the credit cards in the normal day&#x2011;to&#x2011;day management of the instruments and only cancels facilities when it becomes aware of an increase in credit risk and starts to monitor customers on an individual basis. Bank A therefore does not consider the contractual right to cancel the credit cards to limit its exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period.</p></body></paragraph>
