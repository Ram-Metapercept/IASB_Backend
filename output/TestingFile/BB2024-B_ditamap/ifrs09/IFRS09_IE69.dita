In accordance with <xref id="IFRS09_X1771" base="F43660577" href="IFRS09_g5.4.3-5.4.3.dita#IFRS09_g5.4.3-5.4.3/IFRS09_g5.4.3-5.4.3_TI">paragraph 5.4.3 of IFRS&#xa0;9</xref>, the difference between this recalculated gross carrying amount and the gross carrying amount before the modification is recognised as a modification gain or loss. Bank A recognises the modification loss (calculated as CU300) against the gross carrying amount of the loan, reducing it to CU700, and a modification loss of CU300 in profit or loss.</p></body></paragraph>
