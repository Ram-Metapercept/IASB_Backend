There are no transfers of contractual par amount at inception of the two loans, since A and B have a netting agreement. Is this a derivative under IFRS 9?</b></p><p base="F32868150" id="IFRS09_P4806">Yes. This meets the definition of a derivative (that is to say, there is an underlying variable, no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have a similar response to changes in market factors, and future settlement). The contractual effect of the loans is the equivalent of an interest rate swap arrangement with no initial net investment. Non‑derivative transactions are aggregated and treated as a derivative when the transactions result, in substance, in a derivative. Indicators of this would include:</p><ul base="F32868151" id="IFRS09_L0205"><li>         <p base="F32868153" id="IFRS09_P4807">they are entered into at the same time and in           contemplation of one another</p>       </li><li>         <p base="F32868155" id="IFRS09_P4808">they have the same counterparty</p>       </li><li>         <p base="F32868157" id="IFRS09_P4809">they relate to the same risk</p>       </li><li>         <p base="F32868159" id="IFRS09_P4810">there is no apparent economic need or substantive           business purpose for structuring the transactions separately that could not also have been           accomplished in a single transaction.</p>       </li></ul><p base="F32868160" id="IFRS09_P4811">The same answer would apply if Entity A and Entity B did not have a netting agreement, because the definition of a derivative instrument in IFRS 9 does not require net settlement.</p></body></topic>
