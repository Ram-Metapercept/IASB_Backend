The host oil contract is not within the scope of IFRS&#xa0;9 because it was entered into and continues to be for the purpose of delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with the entity&#x2019;s expected purchase, sale or usage requirements (<xref base="F43751967" href="IFRS09_2_4.dita#IFRS09_2_4" id="IFRS09_X1900">paragraphs 2.4</xref> and <xref base="F43751968" href="IFRS09_BA_2.dita#IFRS09_BA_2" id="IFRS09_X1901">BA.2 of IFRS&#xa0;9</xref>) and the entity has not irrevocably designated it as measured at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with <xref base="F43752059" href="IFRS09_2_5.dita#IFRS09_2_5" id="IFRS09_X1902">paragraph&#xa0;2.5 of IFRS&#xa0;9</xref>. The oil contract includes a leveraged foreign exchange provision that states that the parties, in addition to the provision of, and payment for, oil will exchange an amount equal to the fluctuation in the exchange rate of the US dollar and Norwegian krone applied to a notional amount of 100,000 US dollars. Under <xref base="F43751966" href="IFRS09_4_3_3.dita#IFRS09_4_3_3" id="IFRS09_X1903">paragraph 4.3.3 of IFRS&#xa0;9</xref>, is that embedded derivative (the leveraged foreign exchange provision) regarded as closely related to the host oil contract?</b></p><p base="F32868408" id="IFRS09_P4982">No, that leveraged foreign exchange provision is separated from the host oil contract because it is not closely related to the host oil contract (<xref base="F71118164" href="IFRS09_B4_3_8.dita#IFRS09_B4_3_8" id="IFRS09_X1904">paragraph B4.3.8(d) of IFRS&#xa0;9</xref>).</p><p base="F32868409" id="IFRS09_P4983">The payment provision under the host oil contract of 1,000 US dollars can be viewed as a foreign currency derivative because the US dollar is neither Entity A&#x2019;s nor Entity B&#x2019;s functional currency. This foreign currency derivative would not be separated because it follows from <xref base="F71118162" href="IFRS09_B4_3_8.dita#IFRS09_B4_3_8" id="IFRS09_X1905">paragraph B4.3.8(d) of IFRS&#xa0;9</xref> that a crude oil contract that requires payment in US dollars is not regarded as a host contract with a foreign currency derivative.</p><p base="F32868410" id="IFRS09_P4984">The leveraged foreign exchange provision that states that the parties will exchange an amount equal to the fluctuation in the exchange rate of the US dollar and Norwegian krone applied to a notional amount of 100,000 US dollars is in addition to the required payment for the oil transaction. It is unrelated to the host oil contract and therefore separated from the host oil contract and accounted for as an embedded derivative under <xref base="F71118165" href="IFRS09_4_3_3.dita#IFRS09_4_3_3" id="IFRS09_X1906">paragraph 4.3.3 of&#xa0;IFRS&#xa0;9</xref>.</p></body></topic>
