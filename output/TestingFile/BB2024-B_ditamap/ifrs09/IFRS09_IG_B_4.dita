To illustrate: Entity S enters into a CU100&#xa0;million notional amount five&#x2011;year pay&#x2011;fixed, receive&#x2011;variable interest rate swap with Counterparty&#xa0;C. The interest rate of the variable part of the swap is reset on a quarterly basis to three&#x2011;month LIBOR. The interest rate of the fixed part of the swap is 10&#xa0;per cent per year. Entity S prepays its fixed obligation under the swap of CU50&#xa0;million (CU100&#xa0;million &#xd7; 10% &#xd7; 5 years) at inception, discounted using market interest rates, while retaining the right to receive interest payments on the CU100&#xa0;million reset quarterly based on three&#x2011;month LIBOR over the life of the swap.</p><p base="F32868121" id="IFRS09_P4796">The initial net investment in the interest rate swap is significantly less than the notional amount on which the variable payments under the variable leg will be calculated. The contract requires an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have a similar response to changes in market factors, such as a variable rate bond. Therefore, the contract fulfils the &#x2018;no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have a similar response to changes in market factors&#x2019; provision of IFRS&#xa0;9. Even though Entity S has no future performance obligation, the ultimate settlement of the contract is at a future date and the value of the contract changes in response to changes in the LIBOR index. Accordingly, the contract is regarded as a derivative contract.</p><p base="F32868122" id="IFRS09_P4797" outputclass="keep_with_next"><b>Would the answer change if the fixed rate payment obligation is prepaid subsequent to initial recognition?</b></p><p base="F32868124" id="IFRS09_P4798">If the fixed leg is prepaid during the term, that would be regarded as a termination of the old swap and an origination of a new instrument that is evaluated under IFRS&#xa0;9.</p></body></topic>
