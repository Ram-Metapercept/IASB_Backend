Paragraph&#xa0;3.1.1 of IFRS&#xa0;9 states that financial liabilities are recognised on the date the entity &#x2018;becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument&#x2019;. Such contracts generally are not recognised unless one of the parties has performed or the contract is a derivative contract not exempted from the scope of IFRS&#xa0;9. Paragraph&#xa0;3.3.1 of IFRS&#xa0;9 specifies that financial liabilities are derecognised only when they are extinguished, ie&#xa0;when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.</p></body></topic>
