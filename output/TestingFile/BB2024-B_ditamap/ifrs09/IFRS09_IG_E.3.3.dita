A has a foreign subsidiary (Entity B) in Country Y whose functional currency is the local currency of Country Y (LCY). B is the owner of a debt instrument, which meets the definition of held for trading and is therefore measured at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9.</p><p base="F32876831" id="IFRS09_P5369">In B’s financial statements for year 20X0, the fair value and carrying amount of the debt instrument is LCY100 in the local currency of Country Y. In A’s consolidated financial statements, the asset is translated into the local currency of Country X at the spot exchange rate applicable at the end of the reporting period (2.00). Thus, the carrying amount is LCX200 (= LCY100 × 2.00) in the consolidated financial statements.</p><p base="F32876832" id="IFRS09_P5370">At the end of year 20X1, the fair value of the debt instrument has increased to LCY110 in the local currency of Country Y. B recognises the trading asset at LCY110 in its statement of financial position and recognises a fair value gain of LCY10 in its profit or loss. During the year, the spot exchange rate has increased from 2.00 to 3.00 resulting in an increase in the fair value of the instrument from LCX200 to LCX330 (= LCY110 × 3.00) in the currency of Country X. Therefore, Entity A recognises the trading asset at LCX330 in its consolidated financial statements.</p><p base="F32876833" id="IFRS09_P5371">Entity A translates the statement of comprehensive income of B ‘at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions’ (<xref base="F43752734" href="../ias21/IAS21_39.dita#IAS21_39" id="IFRS09_X1956">paragraph 39(b) of IAS 21</xref>). Since the fair value gain has accrued through the year, A uses the average rate as a practical approximation ([3.00 + 2.00] / 2 = 2.50, in accordance with <xref base="F43752736" href="../ias21/IAS21_22.dita#IAS21_22" id="IFRS09_X1957">paragraph 22 of IAS 21</xref>). Therefore, while the fair value of the trading asset has increased by LCX130 (= LCX330 – LCX200), Entity A recognises only LCX25 (= LCY10 × 2.5) of this increase in consolidated profit or loss to comply with <xref base="F43752735" href="../ias21/IAS21_39.dita#IAS21_39" id="IFRS09_X1958">paragraph 39(b) of IAS 21</xref>. The resulting exchange difference, ie the remaining increase in the fair value of the debt instrument (LCX130 – LCX25 = LCX105), is accumulated in other comprehensive income until the disposal of the net investment in the foreign operation in accordance with <xref base="F43752737" href="../ias21/IAS21_g48-49.dita#IAS21_g48-49/IAS21_g48-49_TI" id="IFRS09_X1959">paragraph 48 of IAS 21</xref>.</p></body></topic>
