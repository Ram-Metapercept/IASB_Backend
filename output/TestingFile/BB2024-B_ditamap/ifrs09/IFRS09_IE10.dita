A further comparison with the pricing of Company Y&#x2019;s peers shows that reductions in the price of Company Y&#x2019;s bonds and increases in credit margin on its loans have probably been caused by company-specific factors.</p></li><li><li_value>(d)</li_value> <p id="IFRS09_P1784" base="F32659079">Bank X has reassessed its internal risk grading of the loan on the basis of the information that it has available to reflect the increase in credit risk.</p></li></ol></body></paragraph>
